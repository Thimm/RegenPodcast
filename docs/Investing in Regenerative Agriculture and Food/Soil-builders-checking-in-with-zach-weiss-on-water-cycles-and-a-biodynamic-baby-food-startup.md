**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:14):**  Welcome to Soil Builders, a series where we follow who is building soils at scale.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:18):**  This is an experiment so please share any feedback.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:21):**  Today we check in with Zach Weiss who argued why climate change is a symbol of water cycle  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:25):**  disturbance and we have a founder of a 100% regenerative farm, the major certified biodynamic  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:30):**  organic baby food company, which we obviously asked why all these certifications.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:35):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:36):**  Why this show Soil Builders?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:38):**  I believe that most change in regenerative agriculture and food will come from and is  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:42):**  coming from entrepreneurs building ways to regenerate soil at scale.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:46):**  I call these Soil Builders.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:48):**  Soil Builders are entrepreneurial farmers, ag tech companies, investment funds, food  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:52):**  startups, new seed cooperatives, teams within food companies, robot startups, investment  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:56):**  vehicles etc etc etc.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:00:59):**  All regenerating soil beyond their own farm gate and with more than their own money.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:03):**  This series allows the community of the podcast, which is you, full of funders, investors and  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:08):**  fellow soil builders to follow their progress, their challenges and their breakthroughs.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:12):**  I hope you enjoy it and please reach out with any comments, feedback and ideas.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:17):**  This time we have an update from Zach Weiss who we had on the show in February 2019 where  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:21):**  we discussed the importance of the water cycle and that climate change is only, between brackets,  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:26):**  a symptom of a disturbed water cycle.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:28):**  Zach shares some updates on how the conversation is changing around disturbed water cycles  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:32):**  and how he is growing and scaling his company to work on more and bigger projects.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:37):**  Hi Zach, you mentioned in our interview last year that you were building a platform to  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:41):**  franchise your business model.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:43):**  How has that developed?  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:45):**  Hey Cohen.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:46):**  Well, there have been some developments with the franchise model, although it's certainly  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:52):**  taken a back burner to implementing projects as that's our main focus.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:01:58):**  We held last fall a tryout event.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:02:02):**  We had a total of over 100 people applied to be our next round of trainees and then  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:02:09):**  through a process of interviews we whittled that down to 10 people that actually came  
**[0:02:14-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:02:14):**  to an on-site tryout.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:02:17):**  This was just a little project.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:02:19):**  We were all able to work together in classic Montana style.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:02:22):**  It snowed about two feet and got really cold right before we started.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:02:27):**  So it was just a really good way to get to know everyone, to live together for a short  
**[0:02:32-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:02:32):**  period of time, to work together on a project and see how people interacted and who we ultimately  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:02:39):**  wanted to bring on board.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:02:41):**  I will say everyone who came was really wonderful.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:02:44):**  I'd be happy with any of them working on a project.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:02:49):**  We've now had five or six of them come on different projects and four of them have turned  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:02:56):**  into quite steady helpers.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:02:59):**  I will say I've had to temper my own expectations just with the limitations of training so many  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:03:05):**  new people and everyone starting out pretty raw skill-wise.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:03:10):**  What we do is quite specialized.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:03:12):**  It's really taken a lot of my time to try and train up these people and just learning  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:03:17):**  that it's going to be a longer timeline than what I had originally envisioned.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:03:23):**  Still working in that direction and starting to train up the first wave of people.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:03:29):**  My hope is that after this season they'll really be trained up to the point where they  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:03:33):**  can step right into project work next year, start to grow our crew a little bit and then  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:03:39):**  slowly continue to add more people to train up.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:03:43):**  Probably once they've worked with us for a couple of years, worked on different projects  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:03:48):**  for a certain type of person, then it might make sense to do this kind of franchising  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:03:53):**  offer.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:03:56):**  Nothing really concrete in those regards, but just starting along that path and seeing  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:01):**  how things develop as it goes.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:03):**  Have you seen the discussion change around carbon and climate change being a symptom  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:07):**  of a disturbed water cycle?  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:09):**  I've seen it a lot more since our interview, but obviously I'm very biased.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:14):**  To be real with you, I can't say I've really seen the mainstream discussion around carbon  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:19):**  and climate change and water really change at all.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:23):**  I think the voices talking about water are getting a little bit louder, but we're not  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:29):**  even at the early adopter stage yet.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:31):**  It's really early on and people are starting to become aware of how vital water is for  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:37):**  climate.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:39):**  I see a lot of misinformation and I see the information that is out there being applied  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:44):**  to whatever political slant people are aiming for.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:51):**  I think the discussion in a mainstream sense is getting worse, if anything.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:56):**  I'll use Australia as an example.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:04:58):**  I was over working there in January when there were really catastrophic fires ravaging through  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:05:05):**  the whole country.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:05:06):**  It basically burned all of New South Wales, all of the eastern and southeastern coast  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:05:13):**  of Australia.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:05:15):**  What are the predominant narratives of what's going on?  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:05:19):**  You have one side of the media saying that it's the greenie policies that are causing  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:05:25):**  these massive scale fires.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:05:26):**  Then you have the other side saying it's all from carbon emissions that are causing these  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:05:32):**  massive fires when neither of those are true.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:05:34):**  It's actually from the disturbed water cycle, from the privatization of water, from the  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:05:39):**  manipulation of water and a false scarcity that's created by how they sell and regulate  
**[0:05:45-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:05:45):**  the water and they're pulling waters out of the rivers and destroying the climate.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:05:53):**  That narrative is not being discussed at all.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:05:55):**  It's totally shuffled under the rug.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:05:57):**  There's too much money and investment behind it.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:00):**  You have the media just throwing out these two narratives that don't even begin to address  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:05):**  the reality, but that's what everyone's listening to.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:09):**  People basically can choose from one of those two narratives which they're going to believe.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:15):**  I hope to see it change.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:17):**  I hope that these voices for water keep getting louder.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:20):**  I hope more people begin to open up to it, but I can't say by and large I've seen the  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:26):**  mainstream discussion around carbon, climate and water really change much at all.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:33):**  Next up, we have a company introduction by Keith Lowe, co-founder of White Leaf Provisions,  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:37):**  a US baby food brand using only Biodynamic, the major certified ingredients.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:42):**  We talk about why the focus on Biodynamic and what are the connections between regenerative  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:46):**  agriculture practices and Biodynamic farming.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:49):**  Plus, how is the market in the US responding to these products?  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:53):**  Hi, Keith.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:54):**  Welcome to the show.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:55):**  Could you introduce yourself and what brings you to work in the food space?  
**[0:06:59-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:06:59):**  Hi, Cohen.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:07:00):**  Thank you so much for taking the time to have this discussion.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:07:06):**  My name is Keith.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:07:07):**  I am the co-founder of White Leaf Provisions along with my wife, Megan.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:07:12):**  We are the first company in the US to launch a line of regeneratively farmed Biodynamic  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:07:19):**  baby and family foods.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:07:21):**  I guess the company began, I guess, with the meeting of two minds between Megan and myself.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:07:29):**  I was born and raised in a small farming community in Ireland.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:07:34):**  Before I met Megan, she'd also spent many years in Europe with her education.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:07:40):**  But I had been raised in that small farming community in Ireland.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:07:45):**  I was becoming aware of organic farming, regenerative farming.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:07:51):**  I went on to be a classically trained chef where I cooked professionally throughout Europe,  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:07:56):**  Australia, Asia, and America for many years, most of those years at executive level.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:08:02):**  Being in the culinary scene in Europe, I was becoming aware of the Demeter certification,  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:08:07):**  kind of what it umbrellaed, and the regenerative farming aspects behind the Demeter certification,  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:08:14):**  which I found fascinating.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:08:17):**  As Megan was living in Europe before I met her, she was just developing a love for Europe's  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:08:21):**  approach to food farming, feeding, lifestyle around food.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:08:28):**  I moved to the States about 11 years ago, where I met Megan for the first time.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:08:34):**  We fell in love.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:08:35):**  We got married.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:08:36):**  A few years after that, we gave birth to our son Keegan.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:08:42):**  When Keegan was born, I quit cooking professionally, became a stay-at-home dad.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:08:48):**  I was raising Keegan in the fashion how I was raised in Ireland.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:08:52):**  I cooked all of his meals from scratch using the best ingredients.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:08:57):**  We had a very, very simplistic food and lifestyle and way to raise Keegan.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:09:06):**  I felt that was very, very important.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:09:08):**  Like every other parent, I was still looking for a little convenient snack or a food option  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:09:13):**  for on-the-go between meals, something to take to the park or traveling.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:09:19):**  I discovered the baby and toddler food aisles in the US for the first time and looking for  
**[0:09:26-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:09:26):**  products that were comparable to what I could find in Europe in terms of purity, transparency.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:09:35):**  I didn't really see that.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:09:36):**  I saw a lot of organic and GMO-free, which was amazing.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:09:41):**  It tells me that parents do more research.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:09:45):**  They demand more and more from products and brands, especially when they're feeding their  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:09:49):**  kids.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:09:50):**  It was encouraging to see that 90% of that section of the store was all certified organic  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:09:55):**  and GMO-free in the US.  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:09:57):**  But I knew there was a missing piece here.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:09:59):**  I knew it was a bigger picture.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:10:03):**  There was no mention of the farming and the effects of the farming that these products  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:10:08):**  were having on climate change.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:10:10):**  There was no mention of soil health.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:10:12):**  There was no mention of biodiversity and the important role that plays in products.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:10:19):**  We set out to build a trusted family brand that had regenerative or biodynamic farming  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:10:25):**  at the core of all of the products that we launched.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:10:28):**  Thankfully, we have been growing at a really encouraging pace.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:10:37):**  It's been challenging, but it's been amazing to watch parents get introduced to so many  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:10:45):**  of these regenerative farming practices that will play such a key important role in the  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:10:51):**  health of the planet that their kids will inherit.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:10:55):**  It's been an amazing journey to launch Whiteleaf.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:10:59):**  What is Whiteleaf Provisions?  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:11:02):**  What is Whiteleaf?  
**[0:11:04-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:11:04):**  When we set out to build Whiteleaf, I think the goal of our business was to offer parents  
**[0:11:13-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:11:13):**  a line of products that had a level of purity and transparency that we as parents had not  
**[0:11:21-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:11:21):**  seen in the US market before.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:11:24):**  I think when you talk about transparency, I think it's a key deciding factor with parents  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:11:29):**  and consumers in general and how they view products.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:11:33):**  I think it's going to become more of a determining factor.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:11:36):**  I think a lot of consumers, and in particular parents, were very satisfied with some organic  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:11:44):**  certifications and it was the GMO-free certification.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:11:48):**  They still are very, very trusted certifications.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:11:51):**  But I find that parents are demanding more and more transparency.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:11:58):**  They're seeing in their backyards, they're seeing climate change take effect.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:12:03):**  They're hearing more about toxic chemicals being used on crops.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:12:08):**  Glyphosate is getting a lot of news coverage in the States.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:12:12):**  They're hearing a little bit more about soil health.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:12:16):**  They're hearing about loss of biodiversity.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:12:20):**  They're also hearing the normal good product versus bad product and what's healthy and  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:12:25):**  what's not healthy.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:12:26):**  They're hearing more about lots of added sugar in products.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:12:30):**  I think what parents are demanding, they're looking for products that can address all  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:12:37):**  of these issues in a lofty goal.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:12:41):**  I think when we set out to build a company, we wanted to offer a level of transparency  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:12:47):**  in all the products that we bring to market from the seeds, the farming, the farming practices,  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:12:53):**  the packaging, how they're grown, the farmer welfare, and how these products affect some  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:12:59):**  of the most pressing issues that parents are facing today or that their kids will have  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:13:03):**  to face in the years to come.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:13:06):**  So when we set out to build Whiteleaf, that was probably the biggest goal of the company.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:13:12):**  Being parents at a time, launching a baby food line was very important for us with this  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:13:16):**  level of transparency.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:13:18):**  The Demeter certification encompassed everything we wanted from a brand.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:13:24):**  That's where I found as a parent that level of transparency.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:13:29):**  So the Demeter certification is front and center in all of our products.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:13:34):**  We launched our baby food line, and then we also launched an applesauce line.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:13:39):**  And then we are also going to be first to market with some generatively farmed biodynamic  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:13:43):**  oats and muesli products.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:13:46):**  They will come to market later this year.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:13:47):**  So the goal is to build a family-trusted family brand that has regenerative farming at the  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:13:54):**  core of all of our products.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:13:57):**  And why did you choose Demeter certified biodynamic ingredients for your products?  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:14:02):**  Yeah, when we set out to source ingredients for our products, we were looking for regeneratively  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:14:08):**  farmed ingredients.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:14:11):**  And the Demeter certification has been present for almost 100 years.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:14:17):**  It's kind of the gold standard for regenerative farming.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:14:21):**  And it kind of encompassed everything we wanted from the ingredients that we were going to  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:14:27):**  use.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:14:30):**  Biodynamic farming, they have this unique connection with their farms, these farmers.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:14:36):**  And we visited many biodynamic farms over the years.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:14:38):**  And it's always been fascinating to go and actually see the farms and taste the produce  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:14:44):**  and get a deeper insight onto why it's important, what they do, and why they have such a passion  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:14:50):**  about what they do.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:14:53):**  Just the foundation belief that to build a healthy farm and a healthy farming system  
**[0:14:57-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:14:57):**  and grow healthy crops, that can all be sourced and contained from within the farming unit  
**[0:15:05-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:05):**  itself.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:06):**  And we were always fascinated with it.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:08):**  It's the outside inputs that throw the rhythm of a farm off.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:12):**  And the fact that biodynamic farmers were working towards building this internal system  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:19):**  within the farm was fascinating to us.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:23):**  I loved the approach that biodynamic farmers have when they believe and see the relationship  
**[0:15:28-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:28):**  that animals have on the farming system and how much of a key role they play within the  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:35):**  farm.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:36):**  I was always fascinated by that.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:39):**  Compost for me was always king anyway.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:41):**  And the fact that there was so many of these farms that this compost was such an important  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:46):**  aspect to the farms was always something that was really fascinating.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:51):**  And building out from the Demeter certification, I was fascinated how Demeter oversaw every  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:57):**  aspect of the product.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:15:59):**  Not just the farming, but the manufacturing, the ingredient quantities you use, the lack  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:16:09):**  of additives, preservatives, all this stuff in the ingredient labels was amazing.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:16:13):**  I love the fact that Demeter were holding themselves accountable for a product from  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:16:17):**  absolute start to finish.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:16:20):**  That was something that was really important for me.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:16:22):**  And the fact that organic certifications, as we know them today, had their origins in  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:16:28):**  biodynamic farming, that was huge for us.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:16:32):**  But it only took a couple of visits to some of these large and smaller farming operations  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:16:38):**  for us to realize that biodynamic was the way forward.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:16:43):**  That's where we had to source the majority of our ingredients from.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:16:48):**  What we're seeing in the States now is there's a rise of the conversation around regenerative  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:16:52):**  agriculture, which is amazing and so encouraging to see that.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:16:57):**  We always view biodynamic farming as the gold standard of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:17:03):**  And so it's been really great to watch parents discover this level of farming.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:17:09):**  We meet parents every single day who, in most cases, most of them had never even factored  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:17:14):**  soil as playing such an important role in the fruits and vegetables that they're feeding  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:17:19):**  their kids.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:17:22):**  Probably all of them never considered the fact that healthy nutrient-rich soil plays  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:17:27):**  an active role in even reversing climate change.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:17:31):**  We educate parents on biodiversity with modern farming techniques destroying biodiversity  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:17:37):**  and how negative that is for the planet.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:17:41):**  All these little aspects, parents had never really considered that before.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:17:46):**  Now what we're starting to see is that parents are demanding more and more transparency.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:17:53):**  And rightfully so, this is what parents do.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:17:55):**  I'm speaking from experience.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:17:57):**  I was the same for my son.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:18:01):**  And they want a deeper look and a deeper insight into products and the farming behind them.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:18:07):**  And especially when they're feeding such delicate immune systems and such vulnerable taste buds  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:18:15):**  as feeding babies and kids, and it's their first introduction to solid food, it should  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:18:21):**  naturally just be the cleanest and purest food you can find.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:18:25):**  And that, again, for us, that was Demeter certified fruits and vegetables.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:18:31):**  How has been the response from the US market so far?  
**[0:18:33-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:18:33):**  Yeah, I would say the response to our products or even the level of farming behind our products.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:18:41):**  When we talk about our products, I always say that the secret ingredient in our products  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:18:45):**  is the farming behind the products.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:18:49):**  And I guess the response has been, it's been very, very encouraging.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:18:55):**  We understand what we have.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:18:56):**  We understand that like anybody else who carries a Demeter certification or who is in the conversation  
**[0:19:02-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:19:02):**  on regenerative agriculture, you're always going to have to offer a little bit more education  
**[0:19:10-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:19:10):**  and clarification on why it is so important and why it is so special.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:19:17):**  And so when we launched our food brand, that is something we knew we were going to have  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:19:23):**  to address.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:19:24):**  What we have seen, we've been talking about our products for, I mean, our first products  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:19:28):**  hit store shelves in late 2018.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:19:31):**  And we've been talking about this from even way before then and even more so now as they're  
**[0:19:37-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:19:37):**  on shelves and parents are trying to interact with them.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:19:39):**  But what we've also seen is the rise of the conversation around regenerative agriculture  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:19:43):**  and parents are really starting to make that connection to our products and the regenerative  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:19:49):**  farming behind them.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:19:52):**  So the response has been really interesting.  
**[0:19:53-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:19:53):**  And like I said in the last question, it's been amazing to see parents from all demographics,  
**[0:20:00-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:20:00):**  from all areas of the states, start to understand how important healthy soil is.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:20:08):**  I feel as for how damaging COVID has been to the world or how much it's awakened the  
**[0:20:17-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:20:17):**  world to how vulnerable we are and our food system is, I see that parents, what are you  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:20:26):**  really in control of?  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:20:28):**  And it seems to be your own personal health and wellbeing.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:20:32):**  So what we've seen a lot of is people are starting to have more time to research what  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:20:37):**  they're putting into their bodies.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:20:38):**  Now it's so easy to access every single, you can take a really deep dive into all of your  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:20:46):**  purchases now.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:20:49):**  And I don't think that people have gone as deep before as talking about soil and biodiversity  
**[0:20:57-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:20:57):**  and compost even.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:00):**  And the ethical treatment of animals and the key role that animals play within a healthy  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:06):**  farming system, people never went that far before.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:10):**  But now I think people are really starting to search beyond just the kind of top line  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:16):**  organic standards and things like that.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:20):**  And they want a deeper insight.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:22):**  And what we have seen a lot of is when parents do open their eyes to this level of farming,  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:27):**  they become ambassadors for this level of farming.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:30):**  It's been really encouraging to see that.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:32):**  Yes, we have a lot of people that try our products because it's something different  
**[0:21:37-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:37):**  and unique and they will try them and then 80% of them become hooked.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:44):**  And then they become mini ambassadors for a brand and for the farming behind the brand.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:49):**  So we're seeing a really steady, steady growth.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:52):**  Interest is growing.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:54):**  Retail is showing huge interest in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:21:56):**  As the conversation around regenerative agriculture is growing in the States, naturally what comes  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:02):**  next is consumers will be like, well, where can I buy this?  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:05):**  What does it look like?  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:06):**  Where can I buy it?  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:08):**  And for us, we're just linking the regenerative and biodynamic piece together that it's the  
**[0:22:13-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:13):**  same discussion.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:15):**  And so we're seeing a lot of that through our online sales and through retail.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:20):**  And we're seeing retail being very, very receptive to it.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:25):**  Retail are always, especially the retailers we work with, we work with four or five national  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:30):**  retailers.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:31):**  And it's the same, they even see that consumers are ready to push the boundaries a little  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:37):**  bit.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:38):**  They're ready for something else.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:41):**  They've been looking at organic and GMO-free products within the specialty, especially  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:48):**  in natural food space.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:49):**  But they've been looking at it for about 12 years and they're ready for something new  
**[0:22:53-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:22:53):**  and different and something that addresses some of the pressing issues that we are all  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:23:01):**  facing and especially that our kids will face.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:23:05):**  And so it's been slow and steady growth, but it's really starting to pick up pace recently.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:23:12):**  It's a very, very exciting time to be, I kind of touted as a market leader in the Regen  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:23:17):**  CPG space.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:23:19):**  But it's been interesting.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:23:21):**  And I think our job has gone more from just putting product on shelf and seeing what happens.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:23:27):**  We've become educators.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:23:30):**  And that's been probably one of the highlights of the business.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:23:34):**  And the fact you can educate parents in particular on this level of farming and open their eyes  
**[0:23:40-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:23:40):**  up to this level of farming and how important it is, that's been probably the highlight  
**[0:23:47-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:23:47):**  of the business.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:23:50):**  And parents also gravitate towards this level of purity to their kids.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:23:58):**  Because a lot of kids, particularly in the US, they are faced with products that are  
**[0:24:02-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:24:02):**  not healthy, that are filled with additives and sugars and sweeteners.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:24:09):**  So I think parents find their products very welcoming because they're mild and gentle,  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:24:14):**  but yet highly nutritious.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:24:16):**  It's just a simple and fresh way to look at really nutritious foods for their kids, but  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:24:25):**  a very meaningful mission behind the products.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:24:29):**  So that's been great to see the growth.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:24:34):**  And what has been your biggest challenge?  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:24:37):**  Biggest challenge?  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:24:39):**  For sure, biggest challenge for us is becoming the educator that I just spoke about, is educating  
**[0:24:44-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:24:44):**  parents on this new level of farming.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:24:51):**  We spent lots of years talking about biodynamic farming and educating parents on the...  
**[0:24:58-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:24:58):**  It's very, very hard to encompass biodynamic farming in that 15, 20 second pitch.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:05):**  And that's the industry standard.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:07):**  That's what people have done forever, to sum up their product in that quick pitch.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:13):**  And for us, we've never taken that route.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:17):**  It's biodynamic farming.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:19):**  It's very, very hard to...  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:21):**  Because every aspect of biodynamic farming is important.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:25):**  And so we have, for us, it's an ongoing process on educating and summing up our products for  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:33):**  consumers.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:35):**  But what we have seen...  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:36):**  That was in the early years.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:38):**  What we have seen is that task is getting much easier.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:46):**  There's a lot of contributing factors.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:47):**  The rise around the discussion of regenerative agriculture and some larger food brands getting  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:53):**  on board over here.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:25:56):**  And it being discussed and this Green New Deal that people were discussing, there was  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:01):**  definitely some aspects of that in there.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:03):**  So many groups popping up that are funding regenerative animal husbandry and farming  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:10):**  setups across the states has been really interesting.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:14):**  I see a lot of press and media getting behind it and exploring it, which has been really  
**[0:26:18-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:18):**  encouraging.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:19):**  So that has really grown the conversation.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:22):**  It's been the starting point for a lot of people and they work their way back from that.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:25):**  And they look for the products that are touting regeneratively farmed.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:29):**  And that leads them to us.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:31):**  And then the door has been opened.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:33):**  And then they try the products.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:36):**  And then the response from there has been amazing.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:37):**  But what we also see happen, which I touched upon earlier, is there's growing concerns  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:43):**  with consumers.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:45):**  I always say parents because all of our products are really focused from babies to toddlers  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:50):**  to older kids.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:26:54):**  But parents are starting to see the effects of climate change.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:27:00):**  Over in the States, they're starting to see more about soil and farm degradation.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:27:05):**  They're starting to see in the news over here about how animals are being mistreated.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:27:12):**  They're starting to see local economies collapse due to big ag and big industry.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:27:18):**  So these are all pressing issues for parents.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:27:22):**  And when you start down the kind of when you find the core and the symptoms of a lot of  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:27:27):**  these issues, in the CPG world, it will lead you back to the farming and the policy set  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:27:32):**  for the farming.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:27:36):**  What we like to say is that this regenerative agriculture, it's a starting point.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:27:43):**  But it can address the most pressing issues today.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:27:47):**  So the fact that consumers can go and buy a product and know that, yes, it's very, very  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:27:53):**  healthy for their kids.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:27:55):**  And it's a very, very clean and transparent product.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:27:58):**  But what comes to get it on shelf can also really make a huge change in the world.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:28:07):**  I think that's what people are really gravitating towards.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:28:11):**  The challenge for us is just that additional education piece.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:28:16):**  We're not like every other brand, a lot of other brands in the States, that you can just  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:28:19):**  blanket every retail store.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:28:25):**  We find our core consumers and we kind of grow from there.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:28:29):**  And thankfully, especially in natural food space in North America is so big that we're  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:28:35):**  really working our way through that.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:28:39):**  And that's how we're finding our consumers.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:28:42):**  So educating people on the farming behind our products is getting easier.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:28:49):**  But unfortunately, what's driving people towards even kind of discovering our products also  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:28:54):**  is what they're seeing happening in the world today.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:28:57):**  And so, yeah, I'd say the biggest challenge is just the constant educating people on the  
**[0:29:02-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:29:02):**  farming and why our products are kind of special and different.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:29:09):**  And where do you want to stand in a year?  
**[0:29:12-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:29:12):**  In a year from now, I would like to see Whiteleaf Provisions being that trusted resource for  
**[0:29:19-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:29:19):**  parents that kind of show the transparency and purity of our products, but also open  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:29:27):**  parents' eyes up to this level of farming and the potential that this level of farming  
**[0:29:32-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:29:32):**  has to their kids' future and their kids' planet.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:29:39):**  A lofty goal for 12 months from now.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:29:43):**  But I think it's important to kind of set our aim pretty high.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:29:48):**  We see our brand growing through different channels within especially a natural food  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:29:52):**  space in America.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:29:55):**  And we would hope to build on the success that our baby food line has and bring this  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:30:02):**  level of purity and farming into other areas of the store.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:30:07):**  But I think the biggest goal for us 12 months from now is to continue to grow and educate  
**[0:30:15-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:30:15):**  parents on the importance of biodynamic and regenerative farming.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:30:23):**  Some of the most pressing issues that are facing our kids are now starting to become  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:30:29):**  more and more visible.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:30:30):**  You can see climate change happening in pretty much every backyard in the world.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:30:35):**  Lots of questions about food security.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:30:39):**  Lots of questions about soil degradation.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:30:41):**  Lots of questions about loss of biodiversity.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:30:46):**  So we just want to create more and more allies, become a conversation starter, and hopefully  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:30:54):**  grow our business that way.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:30:57):**  And what is to you the biggest barrier for a regenerative food brand to scale?  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:31:03):**  Biggest barrier for a regenerative food brand to scale?  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:31:06):**  I think it is education.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:31:11):**  Education, educating consumers, educating farmers, educating store buyers, educating  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:31:18):**  everyone who plays a part in the chain on the benefits of regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:31:22):**  I feel is the biggest barrier.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:31:28):**  What we're seeing is that there's a lot of fantastic groups out there who are boots on  
**[0:31:33-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:31:33):**  the ground in educating farmers and helping farmers adapt to this level of farming.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:31:40):**  We see growing pressure from parents, too.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:31:44):**  Parents are always looking for the cleanest and purest products on the market.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:31:51):**  I think more and more we're seeing more and more parents who are also looking for the  
**[0:31:54-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:31:54):**  social accountability of the brands that are bringing these products to market.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:32:01):**  We see a shift that's really happening.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:32:04):**  We see a lot of parents trust the organic certifications and the non-GMO certifications,  
**[0:32:12-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:32:12):**  but they're looking for more.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:32:13):**  They're looking for more and more transparency.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:32:17):**  So I think education is the biggest hurdle.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:32:23):**  When we talk to parents and consumers from every demographic across the states, most  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:32:29):**  of them had never really factored healthy soil playing such an important part in the  
**[0:32:34-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:32:34):**  products that they purchase.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:32:37):**  Most of them had never even heard about biodiversity and the ripple effect of biodiversity in our  
**[0:32:44-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:32:44):**  food chain.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:32:46):**  And so educating parents and just bringing parents into the conversation, bringing consumers  
**[0:32:53-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:32:53):**  into the conversation, has probably been the biggest barrier at this time.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:33:02):**  But we are working actively day by day to change this.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:33:07):**  And we see more and more parents, consumers, grocery buyers that are really looking to  
**[0:33:14-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:33:14):**  take a step up from just their organic and non-GMO products and products that are really  
**[0:33:23-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:33:23):**  focused on kind of healing our planet.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:33:25):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:33:31):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:33:35):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:33:39):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:33:40):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question, how to put money  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:33:45):**  to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:33:50):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:33:57):**  How have we built our decision-making framework?

**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:34:35):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:34:38):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:34:48-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:34:48):**  No.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:34:49):**  It is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:34:51):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:34:55):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:00):**  different means.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:01):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:35:06-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:06):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:09):**  Thank you.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:10):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:11):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:17):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:19):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:24):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:30):**  invest in, what kind of co investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:35:34-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:34):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:36):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:41):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:45):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:50):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:35:51-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:51):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:53):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:55):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:35:59):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:36:01):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/22/soil-builders-1/#t=0:36:06):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

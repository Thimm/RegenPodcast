### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2020-00-28)
**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative  food and agriculture, follow our video course via investing in regenerative  agriculture.com slash course, or in the links below now onto the podcast.  Welcome to the audio version of what we learned in 2020 on nutrition, inequality,  ownership, health, agroforestry, profitability, soil, and so much more.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:23):**  If you want to see all the links, find the link to the show notes  in the description below. Wow.  This was a very, very intense year.  It's hard to believe it was only 12 months.  I hope you and your loved ones haven't been personally  
**[0:00:38-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:38):**  affected by the health crisis.  The attention for food and agriculture has absolutely exploded and many of our  eating habits have completely changed.  Everyone who is selling directly and indirectly to consumers had to deal with  a massive growth, which can be obviously really, really tough, but on the flip  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:54):**  side, everyone who was selling to restaurants, et cetera, had to completely  shift their operation, which hasn't been easy as well.  So it's safe to say that it wasn't an easy year for anyone.  Even if you haven't been personally affected by the health crisis, it's  been very, very difficult to pick the key lessons from over 40 long  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:11):**  interviews we did more than eight webinars and a complete series on  transition finance for farmers.  So let's get a cup of tea and give it a try.  First up health, even in a year where almost every conversation we had was  about our health, there's still hardly any attention for the potential for food  
**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:28):**  as prevention or preventive medicine.  This really, really blows my mind.  Zegbuss joined us to discuss why all health issues come back to how we treat  the soil and what's actually in our food.  Greg Schumacher came back to share his latest learnings and it absolutely  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:45):**  shocked him to see how fast nutrients disappear when something is harvested.  And the huge differences there are between organic and non-organic when  measured on the farm, but interestingly enough, not on the supermarket shelf.  So a lot more research is needed there.  We also took a deep dive into animal protein as a preventive medicine with  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:03):**  Pierre Biel.  Pierre started two clinical trials with COVID-19 patients and in older people  with the aim to evaluate whether omega-3 diet enrichment, basically meaning  regenerative farmed animals,  animal protein could protect patients against severe forms of COVID-19.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:19):**  Extremely fascinating.  And obviously we need to follow up to see how those clinical trials have been going.  You can see a full list of interviews on nutrient density in the links below.  Ownership, inequality, access, racism, and discrimination.  Of course we all knew this wasn't a fair world, but in our little bubble,  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:36):**  it was very easy and convenient to forget just how unfair it really is.  In the interview with Chris Newman, where we discussed his work at Sylvan  Aquifer Farms, we only scratched the surface.  Chris didn't only blew up the myth of the single family farm, which was about  time, but also made it painfully clear that the current farming system in the  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:54):**  global North is extremely, and this is capital letters, unfair.  And this is an understatement.  Plus most importantly, what to do about it.  Hint, invest in indigenous collectives as soon as possible.  If you're interested in ag at all, do yourself a favor, follow Chris and Sarah  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:10):**  Mock and the collective on Instagram.  Find the links below.  And if you haven't, please do listen to this episode.  It might make you feel quite uncomfortable, which is good.  And let me know your feedback after having a listen.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:23):**  Profits.  Can you make money with regenerative farming?  Probably the question we get the most.  And the answer is simple, but very complex.  Yes, you absolutely can.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:31):**  But it, of course there's always a but.  Completely depends on the context.  We had Jonathan Lundgren co-author of the only period reviewed paper  comparing profitability of region versus extractive agriculture.  He joined the podcast to talk about the financial profits and about other  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:47):**  research coming out and why it's so difficult to do this type of research.  I would say an absolutely fascinating interview.  And what about feeding the world?  Isn't regenerative slash organic slash agroecology slash permaculture  fill in your own buzzword?  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:00):**  Yielding a lot less.  So we will all starve and have to cut down the last remaining rainforest.  With Fabio Sakamoto, we discussed how to close the yield gap that in some  cases is absolutely there between regenerative organic and extractive  agriculture, in this case in grains and pulses in Brazil.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:19):**  And yes, again, it's absolutely possible.  Don't let anybody tell you, you cannot feed the world while farming with nature.  This doesn't mean it's easy.  It's naturally more complex than we have time for here.  But I did find a great short podcast.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:32):**  I think it's seven or eight minutes by Charles Eisenstein,  where he tackles this issue.  Again, the link you can find below.  So big money is coming.  Financial markets are waking up, but we're not there yet.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:41):**  We saw some great signs of progress this year.  We saw the first green bond again by Fabio.  Congrats Fabio focused on regenerative farming approaches in  Brazil, severely oversubscribed.  More than 200 million has been invested by 123 in agroforestry.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:56):**  Two interviews with Oliver Henke and Richard Fokken can be found below.  Skin in the game transition finance by the perennial fund by Med-Ag.  They're almost closing their first fund.  Congrats to Brendan and Phil and the whole team, obviously at Med-Ag.  And crowd investing is finally coming to us to allow retail investors,  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:13):**  people like you and me to invest in regenerative transitions.  You can find the interview with Dan Meder below.  And big food companies are starting to pay attention.  Congrats to Bastien on all the progress the Earthworm Foundation has been  making with Nestle, Ferrero and many others.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:27):**  But, and there's always a but, these examples seem to be very small exceptions  compared to the rest of the financial market, because the rest of the  financial market hasn't really priced in the risks of extractive agriculture at all.  We had a very interesting discussion with the people from Planet Tracker,  Marc Campanale and Matt McLuckie, who painfully show us what is wrong with  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:51):**  the current financial system and the pricing of agriculture and food.  You can find more in the interview, but also on the Planet Tracker website.  Definitely have a look.  And I can hear many, many farmers thinking who are listening to this, that  basically when they're discussing with their local bank representative, that  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:09):**  they are educating them on soil and what regenerative farming actually means.  We're absolutely not in a position where a farmer or the cost of capital of a  farmer is based on their soil and based on their farming management.  But, Robin O'Brien of Replant Capital did launch a $250 million  fund focusing on that and doing just that.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:31):**  Food.  What happens after the farm gate is as important as what happens on the farm.  We need way better food companies, so more money flows to the farm and to the  farmer who is making these transitions.  We did an eight-part transition finance for farmer series with our cohost and  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:46):**  partner in crime, Benedict Bozo.  And we concluded that before even thinking about transition finance, we  need better off-take agreements.  Farmers need better long-term off-take agreements in order  to take on transition finance.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:00):**  We looked at a farm to bottle soy sauce company where the farmer is actually  part of the company and we even had a biodynamic baby food company on the show.  Early days.  We feel extremely fortunate to speak to so many of the pioneers, like the queen  of Regenecke, Elaine Ingham, but it also feels like we're in a bubble and  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:18):**  we're very, very early on the journey.  This makes it very exciting because so many things of this new movement,  industry, whatever we want to call it, have to be invented, like the robots of  Clint, the virtual fences of Frank, which we had on the show, which could both end  up revolutionizing the industry as we know it today and Greg Schumacher showed  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:37):**  us again that we have no idea what's in our food today and why it's so difficult  to measure that.  But don't underestimate the decade long journey that we have ahead of us, which  brings us to the lesson that we had before focus, focus, focus.  This is the final lesson.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:52):**  And if you haven't been following us for a while, this may sound familiar because  we had it as a lesson before in 2019.  I'm very, very excited for another fascinating year and actually many  fascinating years where we try to go deeper into the themes that are most  impactful to us.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:08):**  If you want to know how we selected these, definitely check out our  website, definitely find the links below because we have a full framework of how  we selected health, which means nutrient density and food and the connection  between healthy soil, healthy produce, healthy gut system, healthy people.  Technology, what is the technology needed to scale regenerative agriculture to a  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:28):**  watershed ecosystem or landscape level?  Payment system for farmers, how do we pay farmers for ecosystem services?  Although nobody likes that word.  And transition finance, how do we finance this all?  We hope honestly that 2021 will be a boring as in uneventful year where we  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:44):**  start to focus on the growth of the regenerative agriculture sector and start  to build the key pieces for the rest of this decade to capture this amazing  momentum that has been happening.  We're very much looking forward to next year.  We'll be exploring the tech side of landscape scale, regeneration, hopefully  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:58):**  dive deeper into regenerative aquaculture and so much more.  And I wish you a very joyful holiday season looking forward to regenerating  so much more soils and many more hectares in 2021.  And many things for listening, watching, sharing, and participating.  And actually a small bonus lesson.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:15):**  Pay what you think is worth is actually working.  To help you to invest in regenerative agriculture and food, to help you ask  the right questions, to see the right trends, we launched a video course in  August, 2020, and the participants can pay what they think is worth to them.  And many did.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:32):**  If you're one of them, thank you.  You make this work possible.  If you haven't checked it out yet, you can learn how to become rich quickly.  By investing in regen food and egg.  No, no, I'm just kidding.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:41):**  Investing in regen food and egg isn't easy.  So don't expect and never fall for any get rich quick schemes.  This is all for the lessons of 2020.  I hope you have a great holiday season and looking forward to see you next year.  Bye bye.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:55):**  Dear friends of the podcast.  I'm super excited to share with you the online video course, investing in  regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating soils  at scale and growing a lot of tasty food.  While doing it.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:08):**  Why are we doing this course after a hundred interviews and more than a  hundred hours of audio asking the question, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils, and I've been following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts.  Since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:26):**  How have we built our decision-making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  What is happening in this space?  What should you read?  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:37):**  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space for whom is this course?  You, the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people  working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders,  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:52):**  crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture key line designers, holistic management consultants, et  cetera, et cetera, people that are building soil at scale and the investors  who are putting their own money to work through their family office or as private  individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:12):**  foundations, institutional capital banks, insurance companies, et cetera.  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:25):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have  people with very different means.  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you  have the means to consider paying what you think it's worth, thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:41):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes  plus PDF slides, so you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and  why extractive agriculture is so risky.  How to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build,  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:59):**  what to invest in and what kind of co-investors you could find or what  kind of investors you could find if you're a soil builder, every lesson  will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports,  what kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into.  If you want to dig deeper, we're going to look at nutrient density,  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:12:16):**  landscape design, and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:12:27):**  agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice before making any investment.  Please find professional investment advice.  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:14):**  Forget about soil health and focus instead on plant health.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:17):**  This discussion is about helping farmers and growers to become much more profitable by  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:21):**  focusing on plant health and how that builds healthy soils.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:24):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:30-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:30):**  planet mattered.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:31):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:35):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:40):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:45):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:47):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face in the future are the ones that are not  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:51):**  just about the soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:55):**  have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:59):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:04):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:09):**  In March last year, we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:35):**  I'm Koon Vasaian, your host.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:36):**  On the podcast today, I'm joined by John Kempf, co-founder of Advancing Eco Agriculture.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:41):**  He and his team of over 30 people are helping growers to make more money with regenerative  
**[0:01:46-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:46):**  agriculture since 2006.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:48):**  And since 2006, they've served over 2 million acres all over the world.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:52):**  Welcome, John.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:53):**  Hi, thanks for having me, Koon.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:55):**  I'm excited to be here.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:56):**  And to start with a personal question, what got you into regenerative agriculture more  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:01):**  than to the, let's do the calculations 13, 14 years ago.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:06):**  I grew up on a family fruit and vegetable farm in Northeast Ohio in the snow belt south  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:11):**  of Lake Erie.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:12):**  And we were very mainstream producers.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:15):**  My father was the pesticide distributor for the local region.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:19):**  I was a licensed private pesticide applicator.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:22):**  And in the early 2000s, 2002, three and four, we had a three year consecutive period in  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:27):**  which we lost the majority of our crops, the four primary crops that we were growing at  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:31):**  that point, which were tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini and cantaloupe.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:35):**  We lost greater than 70% of each of those four crops, three consecutive years to a variety  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:40):**  of different diseases and insects that we were unsuccessful in managing and treating  
**[0:02:45-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:45):**  with pesticides.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:47):**  In 2004, the third year of that three year period, we began renting a field from a neighboring  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:52):**  farm that bordered right up against one of our own fields that had not had vegetables  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:57):**  growing in the past.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:58):**  So the remaining fields, we had been farming for the prior decade.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:01):**  They got pesticide applications every year.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:04):**  And on this new field had been in a dairy farm, small grains, corn, alfalfa hay rotation  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:12):**  with manure applications, limestone applications.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:15):**  So in 2004, we began renting this neighboring field and planted a crop of cantaloupe directly  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:22):**  across the field border.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:24):**  On the old soil at harvest time, 80% of the leaves were infected with powdery mildew.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:29):**  And on the new soil, there was no powdery mildew, not 5% or 10% infection, but you couldn't  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:34):**  find any.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:35):**  There was this knife line boundary right down to the center of the field.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:39):**  So I wanted to know what are the differences between these two plants and what allows one  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:43):**  plant to be resistant to the powdery mildew when the next plant a meter away is susceptible.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:50):**  And you sprayed both of them or your management was exactly the same?  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:54):**  Management was exactly identical.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:56):**  Same variety planted the same day, same fertilizer applications, identical fungicide applications,  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:01):**  but two completely different responses.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:04):**  Over the next six months, a year and still continuing to the day, I began researching  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:10):**  and studying very intensely, trying to understand that question.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:13):**  What are the differences between these two plants?  
**[0:04:15-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:15):**  And I was very fortunate to be able to connect with some leading plant pathologists and consultants  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:22):**  and agronomists from here in North America and from around the world.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:26):**  And what I learned after a great deal of reading and studying and asking a lot of questions  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:31):**  in its simplest essence is that plants have an immune system exactly the same way that  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:36):**  we do.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:37):**  We know that each of us has our own immune system, but they don't all work equally well.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:43):**  Some people become ill with the first cold or flu bug that comes along and other people  
**[0:04:47-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:47):**  practically never become ill.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:48):**  And the only difference between those two is how well their immune system has been supported  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:53):**  with nutrition over the course of their entire lifetime.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:56):**  In fact, from even before they were born.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:59):**  And this same idea holds true for plants as well, that we can provide plants with the  
**[0:05:06-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:06):**  necessary nutrition to provide such a strong immune response that they can become extremely  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:14):**  resistant to almost all diseases and all insects.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:18):**  So that was really the genesis of what got me started.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:22):**  We started making a lot of changes on the farm that I was working on on my parents'  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:26):**  farm.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:28):**  We went completely pesticide free in 2006, which was the same year that I founded Advancing  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:31):**  Eco-Agriculture.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:33):**  And our initial focus, the initial intent of our work was to help growers manage nutrition  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:40):**  in such a manner that they could grow crops that were resistant to diseases and insects.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:44):**  And we were very successful in accomplishing that and are still very successful today.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:50):**  But as we worked with growers, I realized that not only could we produce plants that  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:56):**  had a functional immune system and were resistant to disease and insects, but there was also  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:06:00):**  the capacity to then transfer that immunity to the people who consumed that food.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:06:07):**  And that we could have a legitimate conversation about growing food as medicine.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:06:12):**  In addition to those two realizations, we also had a series of experiences when testing  
**[0:06:19-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:06:19):**  our system and our products on strawberries in California and on corn in Kansas and various  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:06:26):**  other crops, where we realized that we were seeing very rapid gains in organic matter.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:06:32):**  Much more rapid than what would typically be expected, as much as a third to a half  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:06:37):**  a percentage point of organic matter gain in a growing season during the growing season  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:06:43):**  while we were growing a crop.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:06:44):**  So we were actually able to observe where we were building organic matter while we were  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:06:48):**  growing corn.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:06:49):**  Which is something that goes against all known knowledge, right?  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:06:53):**  Well, actually it doesn't go against all known knowledge.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:06:56):**  It goes against some recent expectations, recent in terms of the last 30 or 40 years.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:07:03):**  But actually when you go back 50, 60 years into the research during the 60s and 70s,  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:07:08):**  the common knowledge of the day by leading agronomists was that the fastest way to build  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:07:14):**  organic matter was to grow corn.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:07:16):**  They considered corn to be able to build organic matter very rapidly because it was very efficient,  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:07:22):**  one of the most efficient crops at photosynthesizing against sequestering carbon.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:07:26):**  And today we have the exact opposite perspective.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:07:28):**  So what has changed?  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:07:30):**  What has changed is the way that we manage the crop.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:07:33):**  So to go all the way back to your original question, when I began to realize that we  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:07:40):**  can grow plants that can be resistant to diseases and insects and eliminate the need for pesticides,  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:07:47):**  that can provide food as medicine and that can regenerate soil health at the exact same  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:07:53):**  time as we're accomplishing all these other benefits, I became very inspired by the potential  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:07:58):**  of these regenerative agriculture ecosystems.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:01):**  And my personal mission and passion is to have these regenerative agriculture ecosystems  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:06):**  become the status quo, become the mainstream against which everything else is compared  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:10):**  by 2040.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:12):**  And you started this company Advancing Eco-Agriculture.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:16):**  Can you describe in a nutshell, because obviously it's quite a big company in this space, but  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:21):**  also outside the space, what it is, what are your typical customers and where are you going?  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:26):**  We initially started as a plant nutrition consulting company, an agronomy consulting  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:31):**  company working with large scale fruit and vegetable growers.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:35):**  Today we then shifted in 2009 through 2013.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:40):**  We did a lot of product research and development and then shifted to becoming a products company,  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:45):**  largely because our consulting work was limited, had limited effectiveness in that we knew  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:52):**  what to do.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:53):**  We could make recommendations to what to do, what the growers should apply or how they  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:58):**  should manage.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:08:59):**  But in many cases it was very difficult for growers to access the materials necessary.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:09:02):**  You're meaning they could make it on, they could make the products on the farm, but in  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:09:07):**  many cases that was too difficult and you decided to start making these products and  
**[0:09:11-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:09:11):**  selling it.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:09:12):**  It was very difficult for many growers to access the necessary raw materials.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:09:16):**  The landscape in 2006, 2007 and 2008 was very different from what it is today.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:09:21):**  There was just a fraction of the biological and plant nutrition products, biologically  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:09:27):**  friendly plant nutrition products that were available at that point as what are available  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:09:31):**  today.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:09:33):**  We became a products company and today our focus is still on providing specialty plant  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:09:41):**  nutrition products and bio stimulants and biologicals to professional commercial growers.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:09:47):**  Most of our work is still today with large scale fruit and vegetable growers, particularly  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:09:53):**  here in the US and Mexico, Pacific Northwest, California, etc.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:09:57):**  But we also are increasingly doing a lot of work with broad acre crops, corn, beans, small  
**[0:10:01-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:01):**  grains, etc.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:03):**  So our work, when we work with a grower and we work with a farm, we take a very systemic  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:07):**  approach to understanding all the agronomic influences.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:11):**  What is the local climate?  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:12):**  What are the local soil conditions?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:14):**  We do very thorough soil analysis.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:15):**  We look at irrigation water quality.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:17):**  We look at plant sap analysis.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:19):**  And then we work with the grower throughout the entire growing season to make recommendations  
**[0:10:24-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:24):**  for exactly what inputs he can use to produce the healthiest crops possible and the greatest  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:33):**  economic response possible with the least amount of input.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:37):**  And this is something that I'm very passionate about as well.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:40):**  When we started working with growers on the West Coast, I soon realized that it would  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:45):**  not be enough.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:47):**  It was not enough to have a conversation about improving soil health.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:51):**  It was not enough to have a conversation about producing crops that were resistant to diseases  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:55):**  and insects.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:10:56):**  It was not enough to have a conversation about growing food as medicine because growers didn't  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:00):**  care.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:01):**  And when I said that growers didn't care, they were intrigued by the conversation.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:07):**  They would have liked to be able to accomplish all those things.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:11):**  But it sounded like a pipe dream.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:13):**  It sounded too good to be true.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:14):**  It didn't sound realistic.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:16):**  And I realized that, and also, not only did it sound too good to be true, but it wasn't  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:24):**  important enough for growers who were struggling to stay in business and struggling to survive.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:30):**  It wasn't important enough for them.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:32):**  Those were not powerful motivators enough to them to get them to actually change their  
**[0:11:36-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:36):**  decisions.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:37):**  So our dialogue and our language with growers has completely shifted.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:44):**  We focus intensely on economics.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:47):**  I believe that if we want to change agriculture on a large scale, we simply need to incentivize  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:57):**  the result that we want to accomplish.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:11:59):**  And so our pathway has been to simply show growers how they can be more successful, be  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:03):**  more profitable, and make more money with regenerative agriculture ecosystems than with  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:09):**  the current practices that they're using right now.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:11):**  That's it.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:12):**  We focus on that very intensely, and all these other benefits come along the way.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:17):**  And how do you show that with a typical customer comes to you?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:22):**  I understand that the economic perspective is extremely strong.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:26):**  If you have a discussion on input costs, if you have a discussion on margins, if you have  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:29):**  a discussion on risk and variability, it's a very different discussion than we should  
**[0:12:34-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:34):**  help.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:35):**  We want to help you rebuild your soil.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:37):**  So how do you show or how do you make somebody aware of the potential of this?  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:41):**  And this is not a pipe dream and it doesn't sound too good to be true.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:45):**  Like the level of cost savings you can actually help or the level of improved growth, et cetera.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:50):**  How do you make sure it's tangible and doesn't sound like somebody is trying to sell a fairy  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:55):**  card?  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:12:56):**  You show them, you show them in their fields, not on somebody else's farm, but in their  
**[0:13:01-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:01):**  fields on their own.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:02):**  So you mean a pilot?  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:04):**  So these are long-term relationships I imagine.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:07):**  We develop long-term relationships with the growers that we work with.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:11):**  And our intent is to typically we begin with a smaller scale trial on their operation that  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:17):**  then expands until we're working with the entire operation over a three to five year  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:21):**  period.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:22):**  And then our intent is to regenerate that farm's entire ecosystem to such a high degree  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:31):**  that the need for inputs drops off dramatically and can perhaps even go to zero if that is  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:37):**  the management's choice.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:38):**  And that of course is a process that takes years.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:41):**  Sometimes it takes five to seven years, sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on the level  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:45):**  of health when we first begin.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:48):**  But one of the stories that really has meant a lot to me is this one fruit grower that  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:54):**  we were working with in the Pacific Northwest.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:13:58):**  When we met with him for the first time, it was about 370 acres of fruit, and when we  
**[0:14:03-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:03):**  met with him for the first time, he said, I have heard that you can help produce really  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:12):**  large firm fruit.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:13):**  I don't want to have a conversation about reducing pesticides.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:16):**  I don't want to have a conversation about reducing fertilizer inputs.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:20):**  I've heard that you can help me grow the largest firmest fruit possible.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:23):**  That's what I want to do.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:25):**  Okay, so that was the conversation that we had.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:28):**  Four years later at our annual review meeting, we sat across the same table from each other,  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:34):**  and this exact same grower said that four years ago, I told you that I have no desire  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:39):**  to be organic.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:40):**  I have no desire to reduce fertilizer and fungicide inputs, but I don't have powdery  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:45):**  mildew anymore.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:47):**  I don't have spider mites anymore.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:49):**  I don't have bacterial canker anymore.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:52):**  If I wanted to, I could be organic.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:14:55):**  And this is a grower who over the prior four years has completely changed his farm's management  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:00):**  profile.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:01):**  The insecticide and pesticide applications are only a fraction of what they were four  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:04):**  years prior.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:06):**  He's growing cover crops in amongst his orchard and amongst his fruit trees.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:09):**  He's mulching his fruit trees with compost and mulch.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:12):**  The cultural management is 180 degrees different from what it had been four years prior.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:20):**  This was a mental process, a mental journey that took this grower four years.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:24):**  Which is even short in the process.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:26):**  I mean, four years is nothing in the life of a grower, but it's a huge transition.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:31):**  It is a huge transition, and that transition happened as a direct result of the grower  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:39):**  being open to observing what was actually happening on his operation.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:43):**  So yes, we were able very quickly in the first year to produce larger firmer fruit, which  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:49):**  is what he really cared about.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:51):**  But then as he continued working with us 18 months in, he noticed that his powdery mildew  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:15:57):**  pressure had decreased and that his bacterial canker pressure had completely reversed itself  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:16:02):**  and was gone from some blocks that had been present.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:16:05):**  And so just very close observation and wanting to do the best and just simply the desire  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:16:11):**  to produce the best food and the best fruit possible was all that it took for this grower  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:16:17):**  to completely shift his thinking.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:16:20):**  And that is true, I believe, for every grower in the world.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:16:26):**  No farmer ever says that today I want to farm using a management system that is going to  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:16:33):**  degrade my soil health, that I'm going to lose topsoil to erosion, and that I'm going  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:16:39):**  to produce plants that are very susceptible to diseases and insects.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:16:44):**  Nobody ever says that.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:16:46):**  And the reason they do those things and they use cultural management practices that lead  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:16:51):**  to those results is simply because that is what they have been taught is normal, and  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:16:56):**  that's the way that you do things.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:16:58):**  There's an entire second system, which we are now collectively referring to as regenerative  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:17:03):**  agriculture, that has not yet become mainstream, but that is very solidly based in horticulture  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:17:10):**  and agricultural sciences that we simply need to spread the message of how to manage these  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:17:15):**  systems differently.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:17:16):**  And what is it holding back if it's innate of a farmer?  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:17:21):**  And I think you're absolutely right that he or she doesn't want to leave the land worse  
**[0:17:26-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:17:26):**  than when they either bought it or inherited it.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:17:29):**  I see that the same with impact investors.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:17:31):**  They want their portfolio to go to the next generation in some cases.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:17:35):**  And of course they want to create something better than it was before.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:17:39):**  But if that's innate of farmers, and there's a lot of information out there, there are  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:17:43):**  a lot of case studies, beautiful movies, books, podcasts, like the one you're listening to  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:17:48):**  now and like the one you're doing, what's holding back this regenerative revolution  
**[0:17:53-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:17:53):**  or almost outburst of activity that is slowly happening, but if the potential is so big  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:00):**  and the interest is innate of farmers, what's holding that back?  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:04):**  I think there are a few factors.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:06):**  There's a few that come to mind for me.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:08):**  One is the idea that regenerative agriculture is more expensive and less profitable.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:16):**  That idea needs to go out the window.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:19):**  Regenerative agriculture producers invariably, when we begin working with growers, we expect  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:24):**  yields to go up.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:25):**  We expect profits to go up.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:27):**  If that doesn't happen, we have not been successful.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:31):**  And it happens in a great majority of instances.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:34):**  And in those that it doesn't happen the first year, we take care to make sure that it happens  
**[0:18:38-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:38):**  in following years.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:40):**  So regenerative agriculture producers should become and can be the low cost producers because  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:46):**  they can have greater yields with fewer input costs than the conventional mainstream model.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:51):**  That's a very important idea that I think is not well understood.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:54):**  Not at all.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:18:56):**  And then the second part is that managing soil and plant ecosystems, soil and plant  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:02):**  ecosystems are very complex and they are cycling constantly.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:07):**  They can be cycling in a degrading manner where soil health, soil biology doesn't have  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:14):**  adequate food sources, doesn't have enough nutrition, so it does not release minerals  
**[0:19:17-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:17):**  or plants.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:19):**  Plants don't, as a result of poor mineral attrition, plants don't photosynthesize well.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:23):**  They produce even fewer sugars, which feeds the soil biology even less.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:28):**  And we have this self-perpetuating cycle that is degrading soil health and degrading plant  
**[0:19:33-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:33):**  health.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:34):**  And then we have the exact opposite of that, where we have plants, which are photosynthesizing  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:40):**  abundantly, producing a surplus of sugars, sending the surplus of sugars out through  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:44):**  the root system, through root exudates to feed soil biology.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:48):**  Biology consumes these sugars and extracts minerals from the soil mineral matrix, provides  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:54):**  them to the plants.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:55):**  Plants have an abundance of mineral attrition and their photosynthesis accelerates even  
**[0:19:59-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:19:59):**  more.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:20:00):**  This is also a self-perpetuating cycle that is regenerating soil and plant systems rather  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:20:07):**  than degrading them.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:20:09):**  The only difference between a degenerative cycle on a farm and a regenerative cycle is  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:20:15):**  the farm manager and the cultural management decisions that the farm manager makes.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:20:20):**  One of the big limiting factors, at least for many of the growers that we observe and  
**[0:20:25-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:20:25):**  work with here in North America, is that the understanding of the degenerative system and  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:20:34):**  how that should be managed has been taught almost exclusively for 40 years or longer.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:20:40):**  It is what the growers are inherently familiar with.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:20:42):**  And so there is this entire body of knowledge that is required to begin making management  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:20:48):**  changes and managing crops differently that is unfamiliar.  
**[0:20:53-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:20:53):**  And because agriculture is already inherently risky with climactic challenges, weather challenges,  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:00):**  financial challenges, etc., etc., this feels like a tremendous risk to growers.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:05):**  There's a tremendous risk aversion.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:07):**  So there is this combination of risk aversion, lack of knowledge of what is available and  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:13):**  how things can be managed differently, and the economic misperceptions.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:17):**  So I think those are three, from my perspective and just off the top of my head, those are  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:23):**  three significant factors that really slow down the adoption and have slowed down the  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:28):**  adoption of regenerative agriculture in the past.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:31):**  And what's the one thing we could do?  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:33):**  I mean, there are many, many different things, obviously.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:37):**  What would be the top on your list if you could change one thing in the region, ag and  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:43):**  food space?  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:44):**  I usually ask the question, if you could wave a magic wand and tomorrow morning we wake  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:47):**  up and John has changed something, what would that be?  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:51):**  It can be anything.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:53):**  If we can wave a magic wand and change one thing.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:21:57):**  This is actually, I'm going to borrow from one of the guests that I had on my own podcast,  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:22:05):**  the Regenerative Agriculture podcast, which for those of you listening, the Regenerative  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:22:08):**  Agriculture podcast is for professional agronomists and growers.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:22:13):**  Its intent is to share the information about regenerative agriculture ecosystems and make  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:22:19):**  them widely available.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:22:20):**  I will definitely link the podcast below in the show notes and the description because  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:22:24):**  it's extremely interesting to listen to, to all of the guests John had.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:22:29):**  Thank you.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:22:30):**  So, I had one guest who I asked a similar question and Gary Zimmer, and I asked this  
**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:22:37):**  question of others as well.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:22:39):**  And Gary gave me an answer that I've thought a great deal about and I'm going to choose  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:22:44):**  his answer because I think it is perhaps one of the more influential levers.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:22:49):**  If I could have a magic wand and make one change in our agriculture ecosystems, I would  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:22:56):**  eliminate the ability to apply synthetic nitrogen.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:23:01):**  Because if you can no longer apply nitrogen to a grower's crops, then that means one is  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:23:08):**  he's going to need to produce that nitrogen and grow that nitrogen on his own, which means  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:23:13):**  that he will have to do cover crops and crop rotations and really work with soil biology.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:23:18):**  All of a sudden, the only other mechanism, the only other means to supply nitrogen is  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:23:23):**  to have very aggressive and very vigorous soil microbial populations.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:23:28):**  So that would immediately shift the focus from synthetic inputs to working with soil  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:23:36):**  biology.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:23:37):**  And then there would be quite a range of additional benefits, which would include that when you  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:23:44):**  remove the applications of synthetic nitrogen, your disease and insect susceptibility goes  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:23:49):**  down substantially.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:23:50):**  Now this to agronomists and growers would sound quite heretical to say that we shouldn't  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:23:57):**  apply synthetic nitrogen anymore.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:23:59):**  First of all, it is possible because there are many growers who are doing it successfully  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:05):**  to supply 100% of a crop's nitrogen requirements through biological means.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:11):**  And so there are many who would say that, oh, if you want to eliminate nitrogen, you  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:15):**  would cause a food crisis and a global food shortage because there wouldn't be enough  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:20):**  production.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:21):**  Well, if that were to happen overnight, then perhaps yes.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:24):**  But we have all the knowledge, we have all the information that we need today to deploy  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:30):**  these regenerative agriculture ecosystems on scale.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:33):**  We don't need any new research.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:35):**  We don't need any new information.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:37):**  There certainly are things that it would be valuable to know and understand better.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:39):**  But if we simply applied what we already know, what has already been demonstrated to work  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:44):**  and to be successful, we could implement these regenerative agriculture ecosystems globally.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:50):**  I think it's an amazing answer.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:51):**  And for sure, the first time somebody mentioned that on this podcast.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:24:56):**  To change a bit the focus, what excites you at the moment in terms of your very thriving  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:25:03):**  business?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:25:04):**  You mentioned you go into row cropping.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:25:06):**  What is the exciting part at the moment for you in terms of regenerative agriculture in  
**[0:25:11-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:25:11):**  the space you are active in?  
**[0:25:13-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:25:13):**  My goodness, there's so much happening so fast that it's hard to isolate one thing.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:25:20):**  But I would say that if there is one thing that I'm really excited about, we have been  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:25:25):**  testing a new product that I personally have been involved in the development process over  
**[0:25:29-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:25:29):**  the last couple of years that is a microbial inoculant that seems to be very effective  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:25:39):**  at remediating pesticides in the soil profile, including glyphosate, including AMPA, including  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:25:46):**  many very difficult to degrade pesticides in the soil profile.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:25:51):**  And when we apply this inoculant, we are observing that plants which have been stunted, such  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:25:58):**  as tree fruit that has been orchard that has been sprayed with a lot of pesticides for  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:02):**  the last several decades, all of us that are not doing well, all of a sudden these trees  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:07):**  begin growing very rapidly.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:08):**  There's a lot of growth energy and they become very healthy.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:13):**  And in addition to that, we're getting very good fruit quality where fruit stores better.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:19):**  We had one application on spinach where the spinach remained fresh in the refrigerator  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:24):**  five times longer than the untreated control.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:27):**  And we're also getting a very strong nitrogen and phosphorus release response, which is  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:31):**  to us an indicator that we have really accelerated the microbial population to soil profile.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:38):**  All of these effects and all of these results are happening within weeks of application,  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:43):**  not months or years.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:45):**  And so it's still early days.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:48):**  We haven't launched the product formally yet and it doesn't even have a name at this point,  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:53):**  but we're very excited about the results that we're observing.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:56):**  Yeah, it sounds very interesting.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:26:58):**  I'll definitely check in when it's on the market and when it's being spread.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:27:03):**  And in terms of the finance side, and you mentioned it before, the profitability or  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:27:08):**  the reduced costs of the increase of profitability is one of the big pools of people to get in.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:27:13):**  I heard somebody say farmers get in for the premiums and stay for the cost savings.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:27:17):**  Maybe it's the other way around, but at least the two are very interesting.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:27:21):**  What do you see in terms of impact invest stores?  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:27:24):**  So people that are trying to put their money to work and that are hopefully listening to  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:27:27):**  this show, what do you see as the role of transition finance from outside finance to  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:27:32):**  help more farmers to become more regenerative or to help the regenerative agriculture as  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:27:37):**  a whole?  
**[0:27:38-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:27:38):**  Well, having observed agricultural investments and thought about this for quite some time,  
**[0:27:48-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:27:48):**  it seems to me that the investment opportunity lies in a nexus of three different points.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:27:57):**  One is having exceptional farm managers.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:02):**  I actually put together a podcast episode on this.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:05):**  We had a webinar on it as well.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:07):**  What we have done over the last 13 some years of our consulting work is every year at the  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:13):**  end of the growing season, we would evaluate the results of the growers that we were working  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:19):**  with and score them on a scale of one to 10 just based on our own assessment, not on the  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:22):**  growers assessment, because some of the most successful growers are never satisfied with  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:27):**  their results and others who are perhaps less successful are very comfortable where they  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:32):**  are.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:34):**  And then we would group the nines and tens together.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:35):**  We would group the ones and twos together and we would ask a lot of questions such as  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:42):**  what are the similarities between these two groups?  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:44):**  What are the big differences between the two groups?  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:46):**  What are the big similarities within each of the groups?  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:49):**  And we learned a lot about agronomy and working with plants by doing this every year, year  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:56):**  after year after year.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:28:58):**  But we also learned that the single biggest factor to success for a farming operation  
**[0:29:05-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:29:05):**  in general, not just regenerative farming in particular, is the farm manager.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:29:12):**  There is a group of farm managers who are consistently, exceptionally successful, even  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:29:18):**  when they experience the exact same challenges that neighbouring farms do.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:29:22):**  There's a group of farm managers that always does very, very well.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:29:25):**  And this group of farm managers shares a number of characteristics and the way that they approach  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:29:31):**  management that we've identified.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:29:34):**  And I shared some of those thoughts in the webinar in the podcast episode.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:29:38):**  So having exceptional management is, I think, one of the most important ingredients for  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:29:45):**  success.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:29:46):**  Second is developing a growing enterprise, a farm enterprise that is climate resilient  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:29:54):**  for the crops that you're growing and the environment that you're in.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:29:57):**  For some operations, that means irrigation.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:00):**  For some, it might mean high tunnels.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:01):**  For some, it might mean hail nets, et cetera.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:04):**  The best crop insurance is not needing crop insurance.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:08):**  And so developing an operation that is very climate resilient, I think, is going to become  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:12):**  increasingly important.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:14):**  And then the third is an element that I believe has not been discussed or widely appreciated  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:24):**  at all.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:25):**  And that is understanding the crops which have an untapped genetic potential for increased  
**[0:30:31-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:31):**  yields.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:32):**  So when we think about the genetic yield potential of different crops, it's obvious that some  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:37):**  crops we have come closer to harvesting a much higher level of their yield potential  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:43):**  than others.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:44):**  For example, if we think about producing corn or soybeans, when we look at the discrepancies  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:51):**  and the variability between world record yields and average yields, we can see that we're  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:30:57):**  harvesting 20 to 25 percent of what these crops are genetically capable of.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:01):**  So there is still substantial upward room for improvement.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:05):**  But the current growing practices have already come close to maxing out what we can achieve  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:12):**  in our typical climates.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:14):**  Then there is another group of crops.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:16):**  And I think this my personal experience in the fruit and vegetable world is really influencing  
**[0:31:24-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:24):**  my thoughts here and what I've observed.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:26):**  But when we look at fruit and vegetable crops, we see that there are some crops which have  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:30):**  been highly developed.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:32):**  If we take strawberries, for example, 20 years ago, strawberry crop in California, the average  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:37):**  yield was 4,000 flats per acre.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:40):**  Today, 20 years later, it's 10,000 flats per acre.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:44):**  So over the last 20 years, the strawberry crop average yields have increased by 250  
**[0:31:49-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:49):**  percent or two and a half times.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:51):**  If we look at producing spinach or kale or celery, there is a finite number of plants  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:31:58):**  per acre that we can put in.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:32:02):**  And so it's going to be very difficult to get substantial yield increases.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:32:06):**  So these are crops that I would refer to as being highly developed.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:32:11):**  So you have a highly developed strawberry crop or spinach or tomatoes or something like  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:32:15):**  that.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:32:16):**  You're producing much higher yield than what the historically yields have been as a result  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:32:21):**  of intense study and research over the last few decades.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:32:24):**  And then there is a group of crops that have not yet been highly developed that hold tremendous  
**[0:32:31-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:32:31):**  untapped yield potential that can best be tapped into using regenerative agriculture  
**[0:32:37-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:32:37):**  management practices.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:32:38):**  For example, this type of yield curve that we've observed on strawberries has not happened  
**[0:32:45-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:32:45):**  on stone fruit.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:32:46):**  It has not happened on citrus, on some specific citrus such as lemons.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:32:51):**  So we see that there are some growers who regularly, routinely produce lemon yields  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:32:58):**  that are three times greater than the average with not a particular great deal of effort.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:33:03):**  So that is an undeveloped crop that we can have a much greater impact on.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:33:10):**  The same is true of stone fruits such as peaches or nectarines or plums.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:33:14):**  We see again that there are growers who consistently produce yields 60 to 80 percent higher than  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:33:20):**  the mainstream.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:33:21):**  So in these undeveloped crops, crops that haven't had the same degree of development  
**[0:33:26-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:33:26):**  focus, there is a tremendous potential because in many cases the reason the yield increase  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:33:36):**  has not expanded to the entire industry is because these crops are what I refer to as  
**[0:33:41-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:33:41):**  biologically sensitive.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:33:43):**  In order to produce these higher yields, in order to produce this additional level of  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:33:46):**  plant health, they need to be managed differently than the mainstream system is currently managing  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:33:51):**  them.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:33:52):**  They need to have good biology in the rhizosphere.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:33:54):**  And as a result, so I think the long way around to answering your question, the big opportunity  
**[0:34:01-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:34:01):**  that I see in regenerative agriculture ecosystems is by focusing on crops which have not yet  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:34:08):**  been highly developed, which have a tremendous amount of untapped upside being managed by  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:34:13):**  exceptional managers who will consistently do well in ecosystems that have been developed  
**[0:34:19-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:34:19):**  to be very climate resilient.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:34:21):**  And you're talking about yield here.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:34:24):**  What do you see in nutrient density, which is starting to be a buzz word everywhere,  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:34:28):**  and I'm using it obviously myself as well.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:34:30):**  What do you see in terms of food as medicine, you mentioned at the beginning of the podcast,  
**[0:34:34-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:34:34):**  what do you see happening there?  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:34:36):**  I do believe that when we look at the public health challenges that exist here in North  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:34:42):**  America and also other developed countries around the world, but particularly here in  
**[0:34:45-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:34:45):**  North America, there is a combination of both a food manufacturing problem in that we have  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:34:52):**  many ingredients and food manufacturing processes which are inherently very unhealthy.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:34:58):**  And then we also have agricultural productive practices and tools being used, products being  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:35:04):**  used which are also extremely unhealthy.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:35:08):**  And so I do believe that agriculture has a significant impact on public health and that  
**[0:35:15-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:35:15):**  producing food as medicine is certainly an objective that we should pursue on a very  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:35:22):**  large scale.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:35:24):**  The question is, will growers and farmers ever be compensated for that?  
**[0:35:27-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:35:27):**  Can they be compensated for that?  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:35:29):**  Should they be?  
**[0:35:30-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:35:30):**  I believe they can be and should be, but that is something that may take a very long time  
**[0:35:38-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:35:38):**  to come about and may never happen fully.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:35:41):**  If we look at the organic supply chain, for example, some people consider organics to  
**[0:35:47-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:35:47):**  be relatively successful, others less so.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:35:49):**  But if we look at organic agriculture having had a presence now for several decades, it's  
**[0:35:57-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:35:57):**  still a very small fraction of the supply chain.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:36:00):**  It would not be my desire to have nutrient dense foods represent a similarly small proportion  
**[0:36:06-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:36:06):**  of the supply chain.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:36:07):**  I want it to be in the total supply chain, everything across the board.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:36:10):**  And so to accomplish that, I think it is not necessarily so important to have growers be  
**[0:36:18-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:36:18):**  compensated for producing nutrient dense foods as it is to make the production of nutrient  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:36:24):**  dense foods an inherent result of the agricultural models that we use.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:36:29):**  I agree and I see the potential key of healthcare, but I also see the numbers that go down basically  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:36:36):**  every year of the amount of the percentage of our income that we spend on food.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:36:40):**  We meaning the global population.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:36:42):**  So it's going to be very tricky that the payment part is going to be extremely difficult unless  
**[0:36:48-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:36:48):**  we come up with whole different systems around that.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:36:51):**  Well what I am proposing is coming up with whole different systems around production.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:36:55):**  When we work with a Stoneford producer who's producing peaches and nectarines and plums  
**[0:37:01-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:01):**  in California, we've already observed this successfully where we will see anywhere from  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:08):**  a 20 to 40% yield increase within the first 12 to 18 months after we begin product applications  
**[0:37:13-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:13):**  in different management systems.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:15):**  So that points to a significant increase in profitability.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:20):**  The farmer immediately begins scaling it onto his entire operation and so the motivation  
**[0:37:26-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:26):**  is coming from increased profitability.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:29):**  But the result is that not only does he have firmer fruit and larger fruit and a greater  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:34):**  percentage of marketable fruit, but his fruit also has a greater nutrient content, also  
**[0:37:38-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:38):**  has a higher nutrient density.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:40):**  That's a result.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:41):**  So I really think that when we think about what is the purpose of having a business,  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:50):**  what's the purpose of being an entrepreneur, the purpose of a business is not to make money.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:53):**  That's the result.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:54):**  We need to have a mission and a vision that we're seeking to accomplish.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:37:58):**  When we, this is the way that I think about advancing eco agriculture, a business is really  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:38:03):**  an engine to drive change.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:38:05):**  That is what a business should be in a way that it should be thought about.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:38:08):**  So our business at Advancing Eco Agriculture is really an engine to drive change in the  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:38:15):**  agriculture supply chain and the food supply chain simply when we begin working with a  
**[0:38:20-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:38:20):**  grower then we have the result, the outcome that we regenerate soil health, we rapidly  
**[0:38:27-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:38:27):**  build organic matter, we sequester carbon, we produce foods that are very nutrient dense  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:38:34):**  that over time can become so nutrient dense that they can be considered food as medicine  
**[0:38:38-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:38:38):**  and we increase a farmer's profitability.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:38:40):**  So we increase our profitability as a company and that is a result and increased profitability  
**[0:38:45-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:38:45):**  of the grower is also a result.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:38:47):**  So I think it is a, if we really want to achieve it on scale, that needs to be a secondary  
**[0:38:56-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:38:56):**  outcome rather than the targeted outcome.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:38:59):**  And if you look at row cropping, you mentioned you entered that space, you're coming mainly  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:39:04):**  from the growing of fruit and vegetables.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:39:08):**  Has that been very different?  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:39:09):**  Has it been difficult as the scale and margins are very different, but the scale is also  
**[0:39:13-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:39:13):**  very different?  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:39:14):**  How has been that experience and what's happening in that space with you?  
**[0:39:19-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:39:19):**  We've been very successful in this space as well.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:39:22):**  It is more challenging because of, particularly here in North America, because of the commodity  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:39:28):**  landscape that exists with crop insurance, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:39:31):**  It is difficult to show the increases in profitability, particularly over the last few years when  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:39:39):**  many growers have booked a loss for their crop before they even planted seeds in the  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:39:44):**  ground.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:39:45):**  So that's a more challenging conversation to have.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:39:49):**  With that being said, we have still been able to show some increases, very nice increases  
**[0:39:55-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:39:55):**  in fact, because today, not historically, up until very recently, in fact, commodity  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:02):**  crops were purely priced on volume, tons and bushels, et cetera.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:07):**  And today that has begun to shift in the last three to five years where growers are increasingly  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:13):**  compensated for protein content in the case of wheat, for oil content in the case of soybeans,  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:18):**  for moisture content in the case of corn.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:22):**  So there have been quality parameters that are being added.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:24):**  Actually protein content is also now being added to corn as well, where we can help growers  
**[0:40:30-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:30):**  produce higher quality grain and that results can result in substantial increases in profitability  
**[0:40:37-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:37):**  as well.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:38):**  And again, that is much easier and much more straightforward to accomplish with the knowledge  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:42):**  that we have about regenerative farming systems than it is with the mainstream.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:45):**  You asked this question to Gabe Brown actually in an earlier interview, what do you believe  
**[0:40:49-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:49):**  I'm going to use this question because I think it's very strong.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:52):**  What do you believe that is true?  
**[0:40:54-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:54):**  And you said about modern agriculture that others don't believe, but I would like to  
**[0:40:58-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:58):**  ask this one.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:40:59):**  What do you believe that is true about regenerative agriculture that others don't believe to be  
**[0:41:02-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:41:02):**  true?  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:41:03):**  What I believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that is different from what many  
**[0:41:09-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:41:09):**  other people think about is what the engine of change actually is.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:41:14):**  There is this idea, particularly within the domain of organic and biological and regenerative  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:41:19):**  agriculture that it takes healthy soil to grow healthy plants.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:41:24):**  If you want to produce a disease and insect resistant crop, as I've been talking about,  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:41:27):**  then you need to begin by focusing on soil health.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:41:30):**  I believe this is in fact completely inaccurate.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:41:35):**  It is not healthy soil that produces healthy plants.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:41:38):**  It is healthy plants which create healthy soil.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:41:42):**  If you consider soil in the absence of plants, then it is essentially decomposed rock.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:41:48):**  But it is in fact plants which through the process of photosynthesis, carbon sequestration  
**[0:41:53-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:41:53):**  producing sugars, transmit these sugars out through the roots as redex and days to feed  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:41:57):**  soil biology that contribute organic matter and that create what we consider to be healthy  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:42:02):**  soil.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:42:03):**  So the foundational idea behind this is the realization that what we have come to accept  
**[0:42:09-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:42:09):**  as normal and as common is plants which are photosynthesizing only about 15 to 20% of  
**[0:42:16-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:42:16):**  their inherent photosynthetic and genetic capacity.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:42:19):**  That it is possible to manage nutrition by using foliar applications of specific nutrients  
**[0:42:25-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:42:25):**  and by using biologicals to in effect hack the system where we can increase the photosynthesis  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:42:31):**  of a given plant or given crop from let's say 20% up to 80%.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:42:35):**  Which means that we quadruple the volume of sugars being produced in every 24 hour photo  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:42:39):**  period.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:42:40):**  But that quadrupling of sugars is not necessarily going to contribute to quadrupling the yield.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:42:47):**  You might get a 20% or 40% yield response but you will not likely get a 4x yield response.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:42:53):**  So all of the additional sugars that are produced from this spike in photosynthesis are sent  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:42:58):**  out through the root systems as redex and dates to feed soil biology.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:03):**  This is how we can build soil organic matter by a third to a half a percentage point per  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:08):**  year while we are growing a crop.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:10):**  We can do this on strawberries in California where we have the soil is tilled with a rototiller  
**[0:43:16-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:16):**  every year.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:17):**  It is covered in plastic mulch.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:18):**  It is fumigated.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:19):**  There are no cover crops.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:21):**  There is a long list of sins committed against soil health and strawberry production and  
**[0:43:26-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:26):**  some of these fruit and vegetable ecosystems.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:28):**  And yet we can build soil organic matter in these systems and sequester carbon simply  
**[0:43:34-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:34):**  by focusing on plant health.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:36):**  So our emphasis, our focus should not be on building soil health but instead on increasing  
**[0:43:44-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:44):**  plant health because healthy plants are the engine that create healthy soil.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:49):**  And I mean this is going to go against quite a few people in the regenerative agriculture  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:54):**  space including me that always says focus on the soil, focus on the soil.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:43:57):**  But it is, you are right, the plants and the trees create the soil.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:44:01):**  What does it mean for soil-less growing in greenhouses, hydroponics, etc.?  
**[0:44:06-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:44:06):**  Well the challenge with growing in hydroponics is that in most cases, in many cases at least,  
**[0:44:15-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:44:15):**  the biology that is needed to support plant health is absent in the root system.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:44:21):**  So I put together a diagram called the plant health pyramid that we use to describe for  
**[0:44:25-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:44:25):**  growers how we observe the evolution of plant health at different stages, different physiological  
**[0:44:32-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:44:32):**  processes, how they become resistant to different types and groups of diseases and insects.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:44:38):**  And what we have observed is that the first two levels of the plant health pyramid, level  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:44:41):**  1 and level 2 where there is complete photosynthesis and complete protein synthesis, these first  
**[0:44:46-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:44:46):**  two levels can be achieved simply by balancing plant chemistry and by balancing plant nutrition.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:44:54):**  So those first two levels can be achieved hydroponically.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:44:57):**  The upper two levels of the plant health pyramid where plants begin producing much higher concentrations  
**[0:45:04-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:45:04):**  and much higher levels of plant secondary metabolites and all these aromatic compounds  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:45:10):**  that form the foundation of us being able to have a conversation about food as medicine,  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:45:15):**  these compounds are only formed in higher levels when plants have an abundant microbial  
**[0:45:21-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:45:21):**  community in the root system and in the rhizosphere, which precludes most hydroponic operations.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:45:28):**  So if we really want to have a conversation about producing healthy food, then plants  
**[0:45:33-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:45:33):**  that are resistant to all diseases and all insects and achieving the upper levels of  
**[0:45:37-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:45:37):**  plant health pyramid, that is generally quite unlikely to happen in a hydroponic system.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:45:43):**  And my final question, it's now June 2019, if we put corn a year from now, what would  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:45:49):**  you like to look back at that you have accomplished, what would you be discussing, what's the main,  
**[0:45:54-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:45:54):**  I wouldn't say the main projects or the main themes, would you like to look back at any  
**[0:45:58-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:45:58):**  year from now?  
**[0:46:00-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:00):**  Well…  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:01):**  Successful launch of your product, obviously.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:03):**  Yeah, there's a number of products in the pipeline all the time.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:05):**  I would say that advancing eco-agriculture as an engine, as a business, will scale and  
**[0:46:12-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:12):**  grow very rapidly in the next year.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:14):**  We have been growing very rapidly for the last number of years, but we're at a threshold  
**[0:46:21-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:21):**  where we expect that to really accelerate when we begin the hockey stick growth curve  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:26):**  that you can think of over the course of the next few months.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:31):**  So that is really exciting.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:32):**  And I'm also in the process of writing a book.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:35):**  It's my desire to have that completed in the next four to five months.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:38):**  It's a very ambitious goal.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:39):**  We'll see if we get it accomplished or not, but hope to have that published by early next  
**[0:46:44-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:44):**  year as well.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:45):**  Sounds like a busy year.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:46:47):**  I want to thank you so much, John, for your time this morning and for sharing.

**[0:47:16-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:47:16):**  much more profitable and regenerative.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:47:19):**  Maybe, maybe we even get to food as medicine.

**[0:48:15-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:48:15):**  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:48:19-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:48:19):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:48:23):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:48:25-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:48:25):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:48:29):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:48:34):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:48:39):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:48:41-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:48:41):**  How have we built our decision-making framework?

**[0:48:46-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:48:46):**  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:48:49-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:48:49):**  What questions should you ask?

**[0:49:16-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:49:16):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:49:20):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting

**[0:49:33-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:49:33):**  No, this is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:49:36):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:49:40):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:49:44-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:49:44):**  different means.

**[0:49:51-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:49:51):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:49:53):**  Thank you.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:49:54):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:49:55-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:49:55):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:50:02):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:50:04):**  We're going to look into why investing regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:50:09-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:50:09):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:50:14):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:50:19-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:50:19):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:50:21):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:50:26-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:50:26):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:50:29):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:50:34):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:50:35-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:50:35):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:50:37):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:50:40):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:50:43):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:50:45):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

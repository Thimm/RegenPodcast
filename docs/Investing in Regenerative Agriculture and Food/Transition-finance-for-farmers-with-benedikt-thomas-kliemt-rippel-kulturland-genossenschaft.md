**[0:00:13-0:00:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:13):**  What could the role of the crowd be in transition finance for farmers, not just to speed up  their regenerative practices, but also to transition from active farmer to retirement  and freeing up the land to the next generation, without selling out but still have a comfortable  
**[0:00:27-0:00:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:27):**  pension?  Now what could Benedict, who is absolutely not retiring, do by partnering with the crowd  to free up capital to invest in his regenerative transition?  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:35):**  Listen to this interview with Thomas, who has enabled local regenerative farmers in  Germany to raise over 4.5 million euros from the crowd.  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:57):**  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  Why are we recording this series?  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:07):**  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the gurus on their  farms, explored farm-sized regenerative designs, and most importantly, started their pilots  and feedback loops.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:18):**  This is where transition finance is key.  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of flexibility,  and the farmer's lack of collateral.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:27):**  Furthermore, there's a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give away.  That is why my co-host, aspiring-to-be regenerative farmer, Benedict Boesl, and I are embarking  on a journey to find out what are the key principles of transition finance for regenerative  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:44):**  farmers.  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative agriculture and food finance  space.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:51):**  We share their insights how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative transition  on Benedict's 1000 hectares, which is almost 2,500 acres, farm in Germany close to Berlin.  This is an open process.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:03):**  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other inspiration, people  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:15):**  to interview, et cetera.  Get in touch via the contact page on the website, investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  That is investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:27):**  Welcome to another Transition Finance for Farmers series episode.  Today with Thomas Ripple, friend of the show who has been on here already twice.  I think that's a new record and we're very happy to have him back and dive deep into  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:37):**  the crowd side of investing in regenerative agriculture and specifically transition finance  for farmers.  And obviously my co-host and partner in crime, Benedict Boesl.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:45):**  So welcome to both of you, Thomas and Benedict.  Thank you, Carl.  And thank you for having me on the show again.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:50):**  A lot has happened since we last talked.  Indeed.  Hi, Thomas.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:55):**  Great to have you.  And to that, Thomas, can you, for anybody, I obviously linked the two interviews we did  before below in the show notes, but can you, I mean, you already alluded to a lot has happened  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:05):**  since we talked.  If you had to pick one thing, it's very difficult because you operate on so many different chess  boards.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:11):**  What have you been busy with since the last time we talked, which was actually the beginning  or the end of last year.  So the end of 2019 and what has been happening in the last six months apart from all the  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:20):**  craziness obviously?  Well, yeah, as you say, the last six months have been crazy for all of us and throughout  the world.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:28):**  But for us, actually, we have received a lot of positive attention and we have a lot more  new members and we're receiving more citizen capital than before the Corona crisis.  So this is really a positive surprise.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:43):**  I was not sure how it's going to turn out.  I was thinking maybe people are going to hold tight to their money, being afraid of economic  consequences.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:53):**  But the opposite happened.  We have a lot more people investing and making capital available because regenerative agriculture,  local agriculture has been a big topic.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:04:08):**  We've heard all about the slaughterhouses that are in the news in Germany but in all  over the world as big hubs of spreading Corona and the work conditions there and everything.  So initiatives like ours are receiving positive attention.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:04:28):**  But besides that, what has happened in the past year is that we have now really started  to take over entire farms.  So before, we were helping farms to secure the land that they have been mostly leasing  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:04:44):**  for a long time and then to buy it, so to secure it permanently.  And now we are receiving a lot of requests from farmers who are retiring or want to retire  and don't have children who want to take over the farm and they want to hand it over to  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:03):**  the next generation.  And this issue of them needing a retirement so that they can leave the farm, they need  money so they can leave the farm and buy themselves a house.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:13):**  They need a monthly retirement.  And at the same time, the young people who come who want to take over farms, they don't  have the money to buy a farm and to pay a farm a retirement for the rest of their life.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:24):**  And this is where we have now started to play a big role.  And this has really opened up a lot of new avenues and we're growing really quickly.  So we're doubling our balance sheets this year.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:36):**  We're doubling the number of hectares we're taking over.  And this has pushed us to think about how to create more decentralized structure to  create a kind of heterarchical organization in the sense of Frederic Laloux from Reinventing  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:56):**  Organizations, the Teal Organization.  That is our goal.  We're actually reading that book together as a team.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:01):**  It's been a big inspiration for us.  That's amazing.  So basically, I mean, I can imagine the growth that happens because of that, because before  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:07):**  you were helping maybe relatively small farms to secure the land underneath their farm that  they've been farming for quite a while and that maybe came on the market or was threatened  to be sold.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:17):**  And those are X amounts.  And then now, because I think we talked about one of the first cases of the pension plan  you're helping farmers with.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:25):**  Last time we talked, it was one or two maybe.  But those are obviously complete farms, much larger amounts, real estate on it.  So the amount of money flowing through the system is much bigger.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:34):**  But when you say we're taking over a lot of hectares, et cetera, can you describe in a  few sentences what we is or how do you take that over?  Because it sounds like a big between brackets, big land grabbing.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:45):**  We're going to own a lot of land, but it's completely the opposite of your intentions.  So for anybody that didn't listen to the previous episodes, when you say we take over the land,  what does that entail?  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:53):**  Okay.  Yeah, absolutely.  So we see ourselves as the commons.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:57):**  So we are a community.  We Kulturland-Ginossenschaft, we are a cooperative.  And what we enable through our organization is that citizens pool their capital, and then  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:07:11):**  we make that capital available to secure land.  And we have really worked out a legal structure for this where the ownership of land gets  neutralized in a way.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:07:24):**  So we take it out of a private capital and we turn it into a commons.  So the idea is that the land never gets sold again.  And we have really in a way invented a new type of ownership.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:07:37):**  So it's not private ownership, but it's also not the classical sense of community ownership,  but rather the land gets removed from the ownership mind frame in a way the land belongs  to itself, and then we make it available to those people who can be the best stewards  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:00):**  to the land.  So just to give you a little bit of an idea of how we do this, it's a little bit complicated  if you've not dealt with this kind of structure before and we're the first ones to do it.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:14):**  But the way we do it is, so we are cooperative.  We enable people to invest money by assigning shares in the cooperative.  And then when a farm comes to us and wants to buy land and they can't afford it, or if  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:31):**  now a farmer wants to hand over his farm to the next generation so he can retire, then  we form a legal entity with each farm and we become a stakeholder in that legal entity.  And the farmer becomes the other stakeholder.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:48):**  And we both have a veto right, but the executive party actually is the farm.  And so what we really do is we stipulate the criteria, which is that the land that we secure  has to be farmed organically or regeneratively.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:08):**  And I'm saying regeneratively because we have criteria beyond just organic.  And actually we don't care about the organic label, but rather we care that the farm functions  in a regional, regionally so that the farm either does regional marketing or community  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:24):**  support agriculture or is breeding local varieties and breeds or is working with school children.  So it really is, it has a social aspect to it and it has a regional aspect.  And 10% of the land has to be put aside for ecological reserve.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:43):**  So it should not be actively farmed, but it should be put aside for wildlife, birds and  so on.  And so when we, let me give you an example so it's easier to understand.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:57):**  Let's say a 50 hectare farm that has been farming for many, many years and most of the  land, the farm is leased.  And let's say 40 hectares of the land is leased and 10 hectare their own.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:10):**  And now the land owner of let's say 20 hectares of their land wants to sell it or the owner  died and the children, they inherited it and they want to sell the land.  And now the farmer, he has to buy the land or he's going to lose it because once it's  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:29):**  sold then the new owner, he's going to want to lease it out for a higher price and so  on.  And so this farm, they come to us and they ask us for help.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:39):**  And so what we do is we set up this new legal entity where the farm becomes the executive  party and we enable it to the community around the farm or regionally.  We also do press work and then people hear about it to invest by assigning shares in  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:57):**  our cooperative.  And then we take this money, we put it in this legal entity and then we buy the land  or actually we put the money in before because sometimes we need to buy the land quickly.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:09):**  So we make the money available, we secure the land and then we ask the people around  the farm to invest.  And then this land is available in perpetuity.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:19):**  Or the 10 hectare farm that now suddenly is a bigger farm and more secure because suddenly  you can do things longer term that previously when you're leasing is risky and you cannot  really plan.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:31):**  And you know you can have access to this land as long as you're farming organically, regeneratively  and have your social role and not set up a big monoculture, big fattening facility on  top of it obviously.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:42):**  Exactly.  So as long as you keep those criteria, the land is yours forever.  And we also, you know, we even thought about the case, you know, let's say in 50 years,  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:52):**  all of the people who started this organization, they're gone and the next generation comes  and let's say they think, well, you know, now we can make a lot of money selling this  land.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:02):**  No, we don't want that.  So what we do is we give the farms a – so if we would ever sell the land, then the farm  has a right of first refusal to buy the land but not for the current market price but for  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:17):**  the price that we bought it for back when we bought it.  So let's say we decide to sell the land in 30 years, then they're paying the price that  we paid now, right?  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:27):**  So basically they're getting it for a really, really cheap price.  There is no incentive for us to ever sell the land.  But say you don't know what happens in 30 years with the organization, with the people,  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:35):**  so you already safeguarded basically the organization and the land to forever stay in the commons,  not at least for as long as you could imagine and all the potentialities you could imagine  now.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:47):**  Obviously, we don't know what happens in the future but you try to take into consideration  everything that could happen and block it from any land-grabbing, high-exits, VELA development,  et cetera.  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:58):**  Stay Forever Exactly.  Because I really believe humans are good beings by nature and we are able to create rules  that bring out the best in us but we all know this from ourselves and from other people  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:13):**  that when we are in a tight spot, we will sometimes act selfishly and that has very  long-term consequences.  So if we thought about how we can set the rules, that kind of selfish behavior is not  
**[0:13:25-0:13:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:25):**  possible, at least in that with regard to the ownership of the land and then how we  make it available.  Stay Forever Thomas, do you have any sort of control mechanisms  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:36):**  in there?  Because I mean if you have a smart investor that owns land, he would basically bring all  the land into your structure, then basically run the company, hopefully successfully, and  
**[0:13:49-0:13:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:49):**  then the time comes where you're like, okay, we might want to sell it.  Do you want to buy it for this very cheap price?  He buys it back and he's made a good deal.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:00):**  So I think if you are that successful, that business model will scale, which I think all  of us will hope that it does.  I think there has to be some sort of way of having a control mechanism.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:11):**  I don't know.  What do you guys have in place?  Stay Forever Well, absolutely.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:14):**  I mean this is something that's taken care of.  So a cooperative in the legal sense in Germany, so the way it works is that each shareholder,  regardless of how many shares they have, only has one vote.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:32):**  This is by law.  This is not something that a rule that we made up.  This is by law.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:36):**  This is for every cooperative in Germany.  So it really doesn't matter if an investor gives us 10 million, he only has one vote  and we have more than 700 members.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:45):**  So he really has nothing to say.  But still we only allow investors to invest 5% of the total capital.  If it's more than that, then we really want to get to know them very well and see who  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:57):**  they are because that's also a risk.  If there's too much capital from one source, then they can also withdraw that capital and  then we might be in a tight spot and we don't want that.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:07):**  In the size of the group and the relatively small size of every individual investor, because  then of course the investor could pass away and the children might think very differently.  And if they suddenly withdraw, like you mentioned, you can cripple an organization or a cooperative  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:21):**  like that.  Yeah.  And actually we don't allow automatic inheritance of shares because we want the people to be  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:29):**  invested not just with their money, but with their hearts.  So if it's inherited, then there's, of course, you know, they're not disowned, they still  own the shares, but it's a transition period.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:40):**  And then we can approve them as new members.  But if we don't, then we will pay them out.  There's no automatic right to join the community.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:48):**  Super interesting.  You know, I think that whenever you start new ways on new thinking, there's a couple  of risks and possibilities that could possibly go wrong involved.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:00):**  But I'm always much more interested in the potential and the things that do work.  So if I was a young farmer seeking land or seeking a way into farming, could I basically  make an appointment with you, Thomas, and be like, look, what do you have?  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:16):**  You know, I don't care where.  I just need land and then I can get going.  How could that process look?  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:22):**  Is that something that you guys offer?  Yes, absolutely.  I'm glad you mentioned that.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:26):**  So now that we have been taking over entire farms, let me give you two examples of farms  that we have recently taken over.  The one is a 70 hectare farm east of Dortmund.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:41):**  Most of it is crop land, quite fertile, and it has three houses on it with more than 400  square meters of room to live.  So maybe at least two, maybe three families could live there.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:59):**  And the person who was farming this land, he's retiring.  It's a seventh generation farm.  They have been farming for more than 200 years there.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:10):**  And his children, they don't want to take over the farm.  But this is his life's work.  This is his family's generational work.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:21):**  And he has been farming for more than 30 years biodynamically.  And so he wants to pass it on to a next generation that wants to continue in this spirit.  And for him, he didn't look at the market price.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:34):**  And the market price would be maybe 2.5 million.  He didn't look at that.  He said, look, what I need is 150,000 euros to buy myself a house to leave the farm and  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:42):**  2,000 euros a month retirement.  And that, for somebody retirement age, 2,000 a month for the rest of his life, that's maybe  4,000 or 500,000 euros.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:53):**  So what he's asking for is basically 5,000, 600,000 euros for a farm that's worth at least  2.5 million.  So that's very generous.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:02):**  And we pass on this generosity.  Because we get it so cheaply in a way, we can pass it on to the next generation very  cheaply in a way.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:12):**  So then now we are setting up a kind of round table or a video conference where we ask people  who are passing or retiring and want to pass on their farms and young farmers who are looking  for farms, we bring them together.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:36):**  And we are asking people to apply for this farm.  And we have some people interested.  But we need to get the word out.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:43):**  Because obviously not everybody knows about this.  And we have another wonderful farm like this.  It's an 80 hectare farm close to Hannover.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:52):**  It has soils with 95 soil points.  So in Germany, they classify the soils from 0 to 100 points.  100 is like you stick your seed in and the next day you can harvest basically.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:06):**  So 95 is pretty good.  95 is pretty good.  And so he's also retiring and he's passing it on.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:12):**  And he also is asking for a certain amount so he can buy himself a house outside.  And he's also asking for 2,000 euros a month.  And that's it.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:22):**  And there's many.  I'm going to another farm on Friday.  And there's a few other farms.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:27):**  And so it's just really been taking off.  And all of these farms, we really are looking for young farmers to take over.  And this is so incredible.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:36):**  I get goosebumps when you tell this story.  Because I mean this is just so desperately needed.  And there's just such an amazing potential.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:43):**  Because especially also in Germany, you have all the discussion about young people not  wanting to get into farming.  People that not want to take over farms.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:51):**  And what you guys are on and what I see for this, it's really what I always try to tell  people as well that when it comes to land use and having access to land, it's not always  just primary production.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:06):**  There's so much more to this.  There's so much more value.  There's so much more potential business models.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:10):**  And when you tell from those different farms in this different context, it's not just a  farmer that you're looking for.  It's also someone that wants to extract colors from natural produce or that wants to make  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:22):**  deodorants or that wants to have a leather factory or whatever.  And you can bring these people together on the farms in those kind of communities.  And these are going to be hotspots of growth and of creativity and of a future and hope.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:35):**  So yeah, it's amazing.  Do you see that, Thomas?  Yeah, I think it's very interesting.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:41):**  Because you mentioned something very interesting from the biodynamic farmer.  You're stuck constantly, you're talking in singular.  And then you said this house can probably or this square meters can probably host three  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:52):**  families.  And then there's three families potentially also living off the farm somehow, the food,  the fibers, the oils.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:58):**  Like could a farm like that 70 hectares or 80 hectares support more than just one family?  And if so, then suddenly we sort of quadruple the potential, at least social impact.  Absolutely.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:09):**  And I'm glad you mentioned that the potential of creativity just explodes when you don't  have the bank sitting in your neck.  And the banks, they only understand classical production models.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:23):**  They're not going to give you a loan if you tell them you're going to do a community supported  farm.  They don't even understand what that is.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:30):**  They're going to give you a loan if you say you build an industry, you know, pig stable.  And so if you don't have that financial pressure, then all of these creative potentials are  unlocked and you can try different things.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:41):**  And we see this, especially with community supported farms, most of the farms that we  buy land with, they are community supported farms.  Literally, because the community invests.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:50):**  Yeah.  So it absolutely makes sense.  But these two farms that I just mentioned, you know, it's up to the next generation,  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:56):**  whether they want to make it a community supported farm or they find other ways with direct marketing,  whatever creative way they want to farm land.  Let me just give you one example.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:07):**  One of our farms is close to Freiburg, Lucerne and Hölf.  We also took over that farm as a whole.  And now it's the first, if I remember from our first interview.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:16):**  Yes, exactly.  So it was the first farm and I was working and living there as well.  I was part of that team that was farming there.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:27):**  And I was just had a small role because I was doing my work for Kötülängen Osenjöf.  But I'm, of course, a trained farmer as well.  And it's my passion and I really love living on a farm.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:40):**  But yeah, so on that farm, it's 33 hectares.  And they produce about three hectares of vegetables, about 10 hectares of grains.  They make cheeses and different milk products and so on.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:56):**  And of course, there's animals, there's pigs, there's, you know, calves and all of that  goes to the community.  There's 200 families as members of that community supported farm.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:11):**  And they manage to support not just one person.  So in Germany now, you could maybe support not even one family with this, with 33 hectares.  So you would on average need 60 hectares to support one family.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:29):**  Okay, conventional model, 60 hectares to support one family and probably one of the family  members needs to work off farm to make it work.  Yeah.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:38):**  And on Lüzsen and Höf, it supports 10 full-time positions.  Wow.  Right.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:43):**  So this is the kind of factor we're talking about.  It's at least a factor of 10.  If you're, you know, really doing a lot of value-added things on your farm, you know,  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:54):**  they also make breads, they make milk products, they're a diversified farm and so on.  And then you don't get, let's say, 20, 30 cents a liter for conventional milk, but you're  turning the milk into high-quality cheese and then you're getting, on the value of the  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:13):**  milk, you're getting like three euros per liter of milk in terms of actual value, right?  So this is what's possible.  And this would be my vision for the future of farming, at least close to populated areas.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:29):**  So I'm thinking, you know, anywhere where there's people, you can have community-supported  farming.  If it's really in the middle of nowhere, then of course, community-supported farming is  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:39):**  not going to be a model that works.  And you know, that's not what I'm saying, but I think there's other very interesting  models for that as well.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:47):**  Yeah, super, super interesting.  The factor 10 is just very impressive going from one niche on 33 hectares, or in 60 hectares  actually to 10 full-time.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:00):**  It's actually a factor of 20 almost.  It's crazy what that could support, which means these farms of 60, 70 hectares or 80  hectares you just described, obviously in a different situation, different local community,  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:09):**  completely different circumstances, but theoretically they could support a number of families relatively  easily if they have local, relatively local markets to supply and obviously the entrepreneurial  creativity to do that.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:22):**  But it opens up because sort of the historic, and maybe you see that now as well, because  you're having a lot of these retirement discussions, the historic biodynamic or organic is still  one family.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:33):**  It's not really operating the farm as a platform for multiple families.  And a lot of the CSA of community-supported agriculture ones I know are much more broad,  much more flat and much more as a platform.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:44):**  So Thomas, could you talk us through the process?  If I decide, look, you know, I need to take more risk and I need more capital for that,  and I would be thinking of bringing in some of our land into your organization, what would  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:59):**  be the steps, what would be the timeframe, what would I have to know and keep in mind  and how would we then basically come together and work together?  And what would it enable you to do?  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:09):**  Well, I know the answer to that.  Right.  Well, I can't answer the second part, but I can tell you what it would look like.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:17):**  And I'm glad you're asking that because when we worked on building this organization, you  as a person, the type of farm that you're running was really what we had in mind.  And so you could already in a way start the generational transition process where you  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:35):**  bring maybe piece by piece or if you wanted to, you could bring all of your land basically  into this kind of mutualized ownership form and then we could raise community capital  on that land.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:50):**  So let's say you just want to start with a patch of your land and you want to do something  special there, maybe permaculture or something.  So let's say you put just 10 hectares of land aside for that, then we create this legal  
**[0:27:06-0:27:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:27:06):**  entity as I mentioned for those who know the German, know what it means.  It's a kommanditgesellschaft.  You become the komplementer, which is the executive party.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:27:21):**  And we are kommanditist, which is in a way the investing party.  And so then the community around your farm, and you have a very strong community, you  have a very broad reach, they can then participate by signing shares and then this money, let's  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:27:41):**  say the land has a value low balling here, let's say 10,000 euros per hectare, then we  can raise 100,000 euros on this land.  And you as the owner of the land, you put the land into this legal entity.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:27:56):**  We buy the land from you in a way and then the land is still available to you, but you  don't own it anymore.  You can still farm it as long as you farm it regeneratively.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:05):**  You can use it forever.  But at the same time, you have 100,000 euros available to then invest in whatever you want  to do on the land.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:12):**  Let's say you want to plant some kind of agroforestry and you have investment costs and so on, then  you can cover those costs with that money.  And you pay a rent as the then user no longer owner to the organization.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:24):**  How does that work?  Right.  So interesting question.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:27):**  So until last year, what we did was that we asked the farmers what they want to pay basically.  So we agreed on a lease on a yearly basis, something between 150 to 400 euros per hectare,  which is much below market price, but still in a way a classical model where we're asking  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:47):**  a fixed price.  And we wanted to move away from that.  And we started a new advisory board where all of our farmers are members and we asked  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:56):**  them how we could come up with a better way to organize this.  And we took the community-supported agriculture as our guiding star.  Most community-supported farms in Germany, what they do is they have a budget that they  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:13):**  need to cover to run their operations.  And then they ask the members what they want to pay.  So it's not a fixed amount, but rather each member can in a way place a bid, then that's  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:24):**  what they pay.  And so this is what we're doing now.  So the farms, they are not asked to pay a fixed price, but rather we say, look, to run  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:32):**  our operations, obviously we need operational capital.  We have employees.  One of them is me.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:41):**  And I also need to make a living.  And so we communicate transparently what that budget is.  And then the farms, they cover that budget collectively.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:52):**  And each farm is free to pay whatever is possible for them.  Transparently.  So I can see what the others are paying or not.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:02):**  It's transparent what our costs are.  We have not decided yet how transparent we want to be about how much each farm pays.  So you would see that farm A paid so much, but do we want to label farm A as in Sandenhof  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:13):**  or do we want to keep it in a way semi-anonymous?  We haven't decided on that, but this is how we're doing it.  Starting next year.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:23):**  And then if a farm…  So what we need is about 200 euros per hectare, which as you can probably test to Benedict  is very low for a lease in Germany.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:37):**  And as we grow, that probably gets even lower because we get more hectares and we don't  need to hire that many more people.  So that's how we operate.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:49):**  And this is how you could… or if you're leasing land, I don't know how much land  you own and how much you lease.  If one of the owners of the land that you're leasing from wants to sell the land and you  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:59):**  don't have the capital to buy it, then also this is what we can do.  We create this legal entity, Komonditgeseschoff, and then we put the money in to buy the land  and then we ask for the community to participate financially and then secure it long term.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:14):**  And as an investor, what do I get?  Good question.  What you get is being part of a wonderful community and supporting regenerative local  
**[0:31:23-0:31:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:23):**  farming and you get a lot of returns in terms of social capital and we're storing a lot  of carbon in the soil by building up CO2 and that has a huge value in creating biodiversity  and so on.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:39):**  But we're not paying any financial returns.  No dividends and the shares are not increasing in value.  And nonetheless, even though we don't pay financial returns, we have been able to raise  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:50):**  quite a few million euros now.  How many at the moment?  So we're currently at about 4.5 million and by the end of the year, we're about 7.5 million.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:04):**  And yeah, so one of the things actually that I'm working on is lobbying for better support  on a political level for what we're doing here.  And I'm looking to France, how they're doing it.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:15):**  There's an organization there that we have learned a lot from, Terre de lien.  They're doing something similar to what we're doing.  And the French government had created a law 10 years ago where they created a label for  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:30):**  social companies.  And you're a social company if the income gap between the highest and lowest income  is 7 to 1 and you state in your articles of incorporation that you have a social purpose  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:43):**  and a few other criteria, but it's not that complicated.  And if you are labeled as a social company, as we obviously are, and maybe you could expand  that label to not just social but ecological, then in France, if you as a citizen invest  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:57):**  money up to 20,000 euros, you can deduct that from your income tax.  You have to keep that capital in the company for five years and then you can take it out.  So just as a quick calculation example, in Germany, the highest tax bracket is 42%.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:16):**  And let's say you are in that highest tax bracket.  Let's say you invest 20,000 euros.  Then you're saving that 42% tax and then five years later you can take that money out.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:26):**  So just in terms of financial returns, you would have made about 8% per year.  Now, compared to our 0% today, that's really attractive and I'm sure that we would have  a lot more citizens wanting to invest money if we would get this kind of tax break.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:45):**  I really hope that we can convince the government that this is something they should do because  now, in times of corona, we want more citizen participation.  We want more investing in regenerative anything, right?  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:59):**  And we know that the climate crisis is happening and we need transition finance, especially  in farming.  And we're better to generate that transition finance than from citizens, right?  
**[0:34:11-0:34:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:11):**  So why not create tax breaks?  Why should citizens pay taxes on money that they're investing in this kind of transition?  To me, it just makes sense, right?  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:21):**  Absolutely.  And I mean, think about the potential of capital flowing into the sector.  I mean, this is just incredible.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:29):**  The only thing is obviously that when it comes to the whole lobbying part and politicians  and everything that's in front or behind that, they have that money calculated in different  areas and to make them understand the potential and maybe also, let's say, the economic potential  
**[0:34:49-0:34:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:49):**  that comes out of it, but also the social possibilities, also costs that they can save.  It's in some sense, it is comparable to changing your style of agriculture to regenerative  where you not only create values on different areas, but you also have an economic benefit  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:13):**  because you're not only able to have additional incomes, but you also reduce your costs.  So this is actually interesting, the thought process to bring through a politician who  obviously by definition thinks rather short term than long term.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:30):**  But I mean, you're right.  It would be a relatively simple step to basically change that whole system and imagine what  would be possible if we did.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:41):**  Is that a bottleneck now, Thomas?  Like the flow of money for you guys specifically, or is the bottleneck the farms you can find  or the land or the farmers?  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:51):**  What would be the biggest leverage point to unlock a lot of these?  Well, a year ago I would have said, no, it's not a bottleneck.  But now that we have so many requests by farms, I would say, yes, it is becoming a bottleneck.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:04):**  And we, until now, have been able to fund all of the land purchases through community  capital that we raised from individual citizens.  But now for the first time, we're taking up a larger loan from the Triodos Bank, actually.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:18):**  Friend of the show, first interview of the series.  Yeah, I hope they're listening in because they're supposed to send us the offer this  week.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:26):**  I hope that the interest rate is nice.  I cannot promise to have it out within a week, Thomas, that they can hear this, but we can  reach out to our friends.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:34):**  Yeah, so I mean, you know, in these days…  That's interesting that you're interacting with the, I wouldn't say the old world because  definitely Triodos is not part of the old world, but it's a bank and that's almost  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:46):**  by definition part of an older world and interesting that you're now interacting with that part  of the financial sector, let's say.  Well, yeah, and I have no problem with that.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:55):**  I think it's, you know, it's absolutely fine.  We have so much equity, you know, we don't have any outstanding loans.  So, you know, there's no problem with taking on loans to fund land purchases.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:08):**  But ideally, I would like to be in the situation that Terene et Lien is in France, where they  have raised more than 100 million euros by now.  And in France, actually, pension funds, they have to invest 5% of their capital in these  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:24):**  social labeled companies.  And they have more than 200 million euros in capital lined up.  And they said, well, they don't want to take on that much institutional capital.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:37):**  So they have limited that to 20% because they want this to be a citizen movement.  Which means they go to a billion, very simply.  They're heading for a billion and that's, you know, I would love to be in that situation.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:48):**  Yeah, but they have a few more years, I think, under their belt.  It's not that fresh, but it's interesting what's happening there.  Also, Thomas, I was going to ask you on this also, you know, going back to an idea that  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:59):**  I could be able to bring some of our land into your organization.  You know, what is the sort of the time requirement on my side when it comes to not only, you  know, speaking to my community and my network to basically try to raise the money, but also  
**[0:38:15-0:38:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:15):**  maybe sort of, you know, accounting things and organizational things that go around,  how much of the, you know, the pre-work are you guys doing?  How much am I doing?  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:27):**  Because obviously time is just like the biggest constraint of all of them.  So having money lined up, being able to move in fast would obviously be something that  would be so like appealing to me because that means I don't have to really do so much about  
**[0:38:40-0:38:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:40):**  it, right?  Well, yeah, you're not the exception there, right?  So the farmers, they are not known to have a lot of time on their hands.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:49):**  So we really do all of the administrative work.  So we create this legal entity and, you know, that might sound like a lot of work, but it's  not.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:58):**  So we do all of that because that legal entity is only holding the land.  It's not active in an economic sense.  So it's just copy paste in terms of doing the accounting, you know, on a yearly basis.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:11):**  We do all of that and the contracts and going to the authorities for the approval and this  and that.  We do all of that.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:18):**  All you have to then do is to go when the purchase contract is being signed in front  of the notary, you are the person going there to sign that purchase contract, not us, because  you are the executive party and that legal entity.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:33):**  So it's your signature.  And when you then, you know, lease, so the land lease, interestingly, is you leasing  the land to yourself.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:43):**  So the lease contract, you sign as Lease C and Lease Sir.  So we're basically just in there.  It's a very tough negotiation.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:51):**  We're just there to set the frame.  You know, we say organic regenerative local farming, right?  And as long as you do that, the land is yours and you can do with it what you want for as  
**[0:40:02-0:40:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:02):**  long as you want, right?  And in terms of, you know, if you were to come to us and say, look, here's 10 hectares,  then obviously we'll have a look at how your farm is set up and whether, you know, we believe  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:15):**  that there is a community because you're just a farm in the middle of nowhere.  You're producing monoculture corn for some industrial production.  Then it's really tough for us to raise community capital.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:25):**  But what if the farmer would be interested to transition?  Is that something like the conventional to, sorry, let's finish this part and let's go  to that.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:34):**  Like, I'm interested if that's happening.  Well, we have one example there, actually, I can give you an example of where we have  actually done that, where we bought 15 hectares of land in the middle of a monoculture desert.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:45):**  And the reason we did it is because there was young people who were super committed.  They said they wanted to do community supported farming and we believed in them and we said,  okay, then we do it, right?  
**[0:40:54-0:40:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:54):**  But we have to believe that it's possible.  And in your case, obviously, it's possible.  So then from the time that you decide you want to do it to the time where everything  
**[0:41:06-0:41:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:06):**  is signed and sealed, it can be as short as two months.  But usually for, you know, for a case where a farmer is handing over his farm and, you  know, we're looking for the next generation and there's, you know, he still has to maybe  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:25):**  buy his house to leave the farm and there's a lot of questions regarding his, you know,  his children.  They might still want to get inheritance and in Germany, the law is that children have  
**[0:41:37-0:41:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:37):**  a right to inheritance a certain amount.  And so you need to find an agreement with the children and so on.  And even if there's no agreement, then there's others, you know, avenues.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:47):**  So this process usually takes more than a year, I would say one to two years.  But if the situation is more clear, like in your case, then I would say two months.  But normally, because you know, you need to go there, we need to get to know each other  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:02):**  and this and that.  Normally it takes four to six months.  And that includes the raising.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:07):**  So includes to get to rally the community of Benedict or, or you're actually saying  in some cases, you have the capital available to quickly move and then you raise from the  community.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:19):**  We generally have the capital available before.  So we put in the money, but we want a commitment from the farm, from the community.  So what we're asking for is a non-legally binding commitment from people that they are  
**[0:42:33-0:42:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:33):**  willing to put up at least a third of the capital.  And then once we bought it and you know, we already put up the money, then we're asking  for people to put in the money.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:42):**  And they can get out at some point, like as an investor, it's, we're talking about investing  here.  It's not a donation.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:48):**  You're investing, obviously you're getting a ton of non-financial returns, but you're  also able at some, I mean, if I remember correctly, after a certain amount of years, you're able  to sell your shares of the co-op for the value that you bought them, I think, because there's  
**[0:43:02-0:43:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:02):**  no value increase obviously of the shares.  Yes, that's right.  So after five years, you're allowed to give back your share, so to say, or at any time  
**[0:43:11-0:43:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:11):**  you're allowed to sell your shares to another member.  So not somebody outside the community.  If it's somebody outside the community, then we need to approve it.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:18):**  But you're allowed to sell your shares at any time to another member, or you give them  back to us after five years, and then we give you back your money.  And in Germany, it's by law that a cooperative, that the value of the shares of the cooperatives  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:32):**  remain nominally constant.  So the idea of a cooperative structure is that you raise capital within the community  to do something that benefits the community.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:47):**  And so there's no sense in having increases in share values like you have in a stock holding  company.  So the value that, the internal value, let's say the value of the land rises, that remains  
**[0:44:01-0:44:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:01):**  within the company, but you can't take it out with the shares.  And that's actually by law, and I think that makes a lot of sense.  And that includes inflation or not?  
**[0:44:12-0:44:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:12):**  So you will lose money through inflation.  The value remains nominally constant.  We could choose to pay a dividend, but we choose not to because the money, the land  
**[0:44:23-0:44:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:23):**  values is so astronomical, land costs on average 30,000 euros in some areas up to 100,000 euros  now.  And if you look at how much a farmer can earn farming his land, on average an organic farm  
**[0:44:39-0:44:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:39):**  earns about 480 euros per hectare and a conventional farm about 420 euros per hectare.  So if you compare that to the value of the land, that's maybe 1.3 to 1.5%.  Now, we are asking in terms of the lease, so to say, that farms are paying, that's between  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:57):**  0.6 and 1.5%.  And we need that to run our operation for overhead.  So there's nothing left over to pay dividends.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:06):**  It doesn't really make sense.  One more question regarding the model.  For example, we often have many visitors or volunteers and interns, and some of which  
**[0:45:19-0:45:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:19):**  by the end of the internship, we get on so well and there's so many possibilities and  thoughts and ideas that we can do.  Like we basically start a side project or a side business.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:31):**  And it's often always involved with a capital investment.  Now, there could be a possibility of basically using your model, bringing in some of the  land, basically thereby raising capital, which then would obviously be leased by me again.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:48):**  But then I could basically lease it to the ex-intern, for example, and at the same time  make it available for him or her.  And he or she could then also use the capital, for example, to invest in a greenhouse or  
**[0:46:02-0:46:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:02):**  whatever.  So, first of all, first question, is that possible?  Because this would be important to me because, I mean, it's my home.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:09):**  So I wouldn't want to give it to someone for 30, 50 years without having an idea of, are  they going to kick my dog or whatever.  So that's one thing.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:19):**  And the other thing is thinking about an investment that goes with it.  Are you already thinking about that step where it's not only about the land, but maybe also  adding an additional sum of investment that basically could be a technical greenhouse  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:37):**  that is then not only 100,000K if we think about that model, but maybe 200,000.  All right.  So let me answer the first part.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:46):**  So if the land belongs to you and we talked about this before, if you need capital to  invest in order to enable a transition or enable a new person to farm that land, then  absolutely, this is possible.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:05):**  You sell the land and you neutralize through our structure and you neutralize the ownership  and then your land is still available and then you can absolutely make that available  to whoever you trust.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:22):**  But then you are legally required to make sure that they keep the requirements, which  is obviously regenerative local farming.  But as long as you do that, it's up to you.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:33):**  The land is still within your full perfume.  There's no restrictions.  I mean, yes, this is the restriction, but beyond that, there's no restriction.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:43):**  You can do whatever you want with the land and make it available to anyone you want.  So to your second question with regard to buying or investing in greenhouses or so on,  that's tricky because we don't want to be the owners of greenhouses.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:57):**  So we can make capital available, as I just said, and then you can buy the greenhouse.  But just recently, because when we take over a whole farm, obviously there's buildings  on there and we need to take them as well.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:11):**  But the way we do it is we take the farm as a whole, but then when we pass it on to the  next generation, the ownership of the land stays within our structure.  So that's in this commons legal framework and the buildings, they are tied to it through  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:31):**  a long-term lease, which is called an erpahrt.  So we sell the buildings, but it's still tied to the land through a 99-year lease contract.  And as part of this contract, we stipulate the criteria that you as the owner of the  
**[0:48:45-0:48:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:45):**  buildings and you living there in those buildings have to also farm the land.  So you can't decide to stop farming, but still live there.  So it's still tied together.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:56):**  And we also make the contract so that even though you're the owner of the buildings,  when you pass it on to the next generation, you can obviously sell it, but you can only  sell it for a reasonable price, which is an objective measure.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:14):**  So you can't stop the transition to the next generation by asking for a ridiculous  price.  And so we enable this kind of transition finance by also buying the buildings.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:24):**  And then we sell the buildings for very, very, very cheap prices in the next generation.  And for example, the farmer mentioned worth $2.5 million, including the buildings and  everything he's giving us for $650,000.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:39):**  Then we don't need to ask a lot of money for the buildings.  So we just sell it for a super low price, but still something because I think you still  own the buildings.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:49):**  And that's a real value that you're getting.  And you don't have an issue to get a loan from the bank for a very good interest rate.  So you're paying less than 1%.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:02):**  And why shouldn't you, let's say the buildings are worth half a million, and then we give  it to you for $250,000.  Why shouldn't you pay $250,000 for that if you're getting half a million worth?  
**[0:50:12-0:50:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:12):**  Because then one day you will be able to sell it again.  So this is how we're thinking.  Maybe through feedback and different experiences we'll change our thinking on this, but currently  
**[0:50:21-0:50:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:21):**  this is how we are.  So what happens if we basically go through the process and then I want to take a loan,  which then as a security I would usually bring in the land that I have, which I've just basically  
**[0:50:33-0:50:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:33):**  sold to you.  How does that work?  Well that's not possible because you can't take a loan with the land as a security because  
**[0:50:43-0:50:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:43):**  you need our approval now.  And we're not going to give that approval because we don't want the land to be sold  again.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:48):**  And if your farm doesn't operate well and whatever, and then the bank would come and  take the land, then the land would be lost.  This is something that we don't want.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:58):**  So you can sell your land for a reasonable price.  We're going to raise market value for it.  But beyond that you can't leverage your land twice.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:06):**  That doesn't make sense.  Well I wouldn't necessarily call it leveraging it twice.  But it's just a process that you have to keep in mind because that's what happens in practical  
**[0:51:17-0:51:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:17):**  agriculture.  You go to the bank, you get a loan and the security is the land.  So it's a thought process that is obviously in there.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:26):**  And it's an option that you don't have anymore.  And if we think back to the 10 hectare 100,000 euro example, it sounds like a lot of money  but it really isn't that much if you think about large changes in investments.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:43):**  It's gone pretty fast.  So it's a relevant question.  Well I'm glad you mentioned it because of course this is also a relevant question for  
**[0:51:52-0:51:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:52):**  the farms that we work with.  And the wonderful thing is that we here have a community that obviously is willing to invest  and take money in their hands.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:06):**  We built our own web platform.  We programmed it ourselves.  And each farm has its own website where you can go and you can choose to invest.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:16):**  And the farms are free to also use that to raise capital for themselves.  And just to go back to the example of Hudson and Hove, they needed money to invest in new  stables and cooling facilities and this and that.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:28):**  And they needed to raise something like I think 450,000.  So they just put out the word and they said, look, we're willing to pay an interest rate  of up to 1.5%.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:39):**  So 0 to 1.5, you're free to choose.  And then people came and they gave loans and they raised the money in no time.  It was over sign.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:48):**  It's amazing.  But without the land as a security, I mean, that's what you're saying.  Without using the land as a security, they got the money they needed.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:55):**  And they even had more money offered than they needed.  So they could choose basically the lower interest offers.  And in the end, they are paying an average of 0.6%, which no bank is going to give you  
**[0:53:05-0:53:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:05):**  a loan for less than 0.6%.  That's amazing.  It's just fantastic.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:11):**  I would love to get to know some of the investors into your structure.  So could you just tell us, what are these kinds of people?  Is there a certain type?  
**[0:53:20-0:53:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:20):**  Is it completely versatile?  I'd love to hear some of those human stories behind it.  Empirically we haven't, I can't tell you the average age or so on, but from my feeling  
**[0:53:33-0:53:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:33):**  and knowing a lot of them, I can tell you that the average age is probably around 40+,  maybe 45 to 50, and obviously some older and obviously some younger.  But this is the average age.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:47):**  And I would say a little bit more female than male.  Noticable.  And most of them, they have a direct connection to the farm.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:57):**  So 85% of people who was investing, they have a direct connection to the farm, either because  they're buying products from there, they're a CSA member, or they have been to the farm,  or they somehow have friends working there, or they visited the farm at one point.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:12):**  There's some kind of personal connection.  And 15%, they don't have a personal connection, but they think this idea as such is really  great.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:22):**  And those 15% are actually the ones that are willing to invest more money.  So on average, the people, they give maybe five, well, the lowest amount is 500, and  there's quite a few people who give 500 euros.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:36):**  But the average amount is about 3,000 euros if you don't take into consideration the people  who give larger amounts, like 20,000 plus.  And those 15% that don't have a direct connection to the farm, they just think this idea of  
**[0:54:53-0:54:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:53):**  land as a commons to make it available for the next generation for sustainable regenerative  regional farming, they are usually the ones who are willing to put in larger sums between  20,000 and 150,000.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:05):**  We even have one person that made a million available.  So half of our capital is from those 15%.  Half of our capital is from the 85%, right?  
**[0:55:13-0:55:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:13):**  Stay Forever Amazing.  And I mean, going back to what you said about lobbying, I think those people, those investors,  if investors are right term, but those people who see the value in this, I mean, they are  
**[0:55:27-0:55:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:27):**  one of your biggest strengths, I guess, right?  So I was wondering, do you have some sort of form where you kind of bring them together  or you have some sort of community that is basically working and getting to know each  
**[0:55:42-0:55:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:42):**  other and communicating?  Because these are the people that have to tell all the other people what they are doing  and why they are doing it and how much fun it is.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:50):**  I mean, this is such a huge potential to basically make this thinking, this knowledge, this form  of investing known to other people and through this sort of bottom up experience, you know,  sort of, yeah, I mean, initiate some sort of pressure towards political thinking and  
**[0:56:11-0:56:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:11):**  so forth.  So is that something that you utilize at all?  Well, we try really hard and we're still open to and when we're exploring different avenues,  
**[0:56:19-0:56:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:19):**  but I think the biggest potential here is always regional.  So the farms, you know, we support the farms in doing events or panel discussions or one  of us goes there or we also invite other people to give a talk and then we create an event  
**[0:56:35-0:56:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:35):**  and then the community around the farm, they come and they listen.  This is how we engage local communities.  But in terms of the larger community, all of the 700 plus members that we have, it's  
**[0:56:46-0:56:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:46):**  really hard to bring all of them together.  And I would say we as a national organization, we are not where most people feel the strongest  emotional bonds.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:54):**  So the emotional bond usually happens on a regional level.  And this is something that we really aim for as we grow in the number of farms.  Now we're 20 farms and I think as we grow to maybe 100 farms and then maybe 1,000 farms,  
**[0:57:07-0:57:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:07):**  then as we have a certain number of farms, let's say at least five farms in a certain  region, then you can create regional structures where then it's possible for people to really  come together because it's just, you know, Germany is still a fairly large country, obviously  
**[0:57:23-0:57:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:23):**  not compared to geographically compared to the US, it's still small, but still it's a  huge effort to come together.  Let's say, you know, we invite them to attend some event, then some of them would have to  
**[0:57:38-0:57:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:38):**  travel.  And there's also the local laws, like the regional laws and the local politicians you  want to really engage and understand and take action, which is much easier if they can easily  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:49):**  visit one of the farms, they can see if they can touch, maybe even can participate and  invest themselves personally and you get a whole different dynamic and discussion.  Yeah.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:59):**  And this is something we still need to figure out how we can utilize the community best  in that way.  So we provide them obviously with information, we provide them with flyers and we have a  
**[0:58:12-0:58:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:12):**  handbook that describes us as an organization, as a community, and we have a nice website,  we have nice videos, but still, I think there is a lot of room for potential to utilize  that potential.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:28):**  And just to get it out a bit of the German context specifically and to end with a few  questions because I know and I don't know the details about it, but you do.  For anybody that's not listening, that's listening, let's say in the rest of Europe, that's not  
**[0:58:41-0:58:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:41):**  listening in Germany, how easy is it because you're talking about some cases, very small  investments and some cases quite a lot larger, 600,000, 700,000, etc.  But always the term of the transaction costs are always an issue, small tickets, it's difficult  
**[0:58:57-0:58:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:57):**  to put 50k to work.  For many people it's difficult to understand, like it's much easier to put 5 million or  even 50 million to work because the cost of doing the diligence and doing the whole process  
**[0:59:05-0:59:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:05):**  and prospectus and everything, it just makes more sense on larger numbers.  But you mentioned that in Europe or in the EU, there's actually some interesting things  that have changed the last few years, not many people are knowing about it and you're  
**[0:59:19-0:59:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:19):**  actually using that to make a lot of these concepts flow.  Can you describe a bit what has changed, I think 2017 or 18, and what makes that possible  for anybody that's actually in Europe that is thinking, wow, I should do this in Portugal  
**[0:59:33-0:59:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:33):**  or I should do this in Spain or Italy, Greece, etc.  I'm glad you mentioned that.  So yeah, there have been significant changes that I think went mostly under the radar for  
**[0:59:44-0:59:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:44):**  most people.  So one of the big issues was that after some shady investments were offered in the past,  the new regulations were put in place that required any investment offering over 100,000  
**[0:59:58-1:00:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:58):**  euros to issue a prospectus.  And for those who don't know what that is, it's basically a very thick legal document  that costs between 30 and 50,000 euros in lawyer costs to make.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:11):**  And so if you're raising 100,000 euros and you have to spend at least 30,000 to raise  that money, that's just, it doesn't make it just legal.  Just legal costs.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:18):**  Imagine the cost of the raising the platform.  It doesn't really make sense at all.  And so they realized that they made a mistake there to be honest.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:26):**  And so in 2017, they revised this law and they said that up to a million euros, you  don't need to issue as prospectus anymore.  Each country has to kind of create its own regulation as to what they require, but it  
**[1:00:40-1:00:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:40):**  should be simple.  Basically, that's what the EU law said.  And up to 8 million, each country is free to choose whether they want to stipulate the  
**[1:00:48-1:00:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:48):**  prospectus requirement or have their own local law.  And is that whatever regulations they put in place, it still has to enable the free  flow of capital between EU countries.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:59):**  So Germany opted for no prospectus requirement, up to 8 million in investments.  And last year they made this new law where they stipulated the criteria, what is now  required.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:15):**  And this is a very simple pamphlet, which is allowed to be maximum of three pages.  And it just has to have the information on your balance sheet and your past year's performance  and a legal disclaimer where it says, look, this is a private offering and it's a high  
**[1:01:31-1:01:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:31):**  risk investment and you could lose all of your investment.  And that's basically it.  You send that to the financial regulatory office and they have to give you the go or  
**[1:01:42-1:01:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:42):**  no go within 10 days.  And then you are free to raise up to 8 million for every single investment.  So this is especially important for us raising money through shares.  
**[1:01:56-1:01:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:56):**  This has been exempt already before.  So for us, it wasn't really an issue.  But for farms to raise capital to invest in stables from the community, this was a huge  
**[1:02:05-1:02:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:05):**  issue because they couldn't raise more than 100,000.  And now there was a legal gray area.  We had an agreement with the financial regulatory authorities where we kind of used a loophole.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:17):**  But basically now there's no more headaches in terms of the legal framework.  And now any farm can raise up to 8 million through community capital.  And we have the IT infrastructure available where this is very easily possible.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:34):**  You have your, if you're part of the Kulturland community, you have your own website and then  people can go there.  They can choose to invest in whatever you want to offer.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:44):**  And this could be all over Europe.  You're saying this might be slightly different in different countries because Germany chose  the 8 million and chose the pamphlet, but it has to be a simple process in every different  
**[1:02:55-1:02:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:55):**  country when you're raising more than 100.  That's very, very interesting and friendly.  Exactly.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:01):**  And so this is possible all over Europe and the IT that we built, it's something we built  and want to make available for any eco-social projects.  So we keep it.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:11):**  So get in touch when you want to do this.  We're still developing it and I would say maybe in a year's time, the software is available  for anyone to use.  
**[1:03:19-1:03:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:19):**  But yeah, get in touch if you want to use it and then we'll work, you know, we'll talk  with you and see when we can make that happen.  And we're happy to make that available to anyone.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:29):**  Super.  And just to bring this conversation home, Benedict, I mean, this has been a long series  where we're at the end, actually, we're going to do another episode where we look back,  
**[1:03:38-1:03:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:38):**  but at this episode of The Crowd and super practical because we're talking Germany, you're  based in Germany.  And what brings this to mind, or if you have in a few sentences, what's your feedback?  
**[1:03:51-1:03:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:51):**  What are your ideas going through your head right now at the end of this episode with  Thomas?  And then I will ask Thomas to say a few things.  
**[1:03:57-1:04:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:57):**  Well, I mean, there's so many things.  One I think that is always so dominant when you hear of initiatives like this.  And I mean, there's so many of which we all don't know of, right.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:10):**  And it's incredible what people already do in that regard.  But you always think, why is not everyone talking about this?  Why is not politics saying, oh, my God, we have found an amazing solution that does so  
**[1:04:23-1:04:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:23):**  much good and it has so much potential.  This is always one thing that goes through my mind.  And I mean, with regard to Thomas and I guess his team, I'm just deeply impressed by, you  
**[1:04:33-1:04:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:33):**  know, the whole thought process they have actually gone through.  And that is something that has so much detail and it goes down to so many different aspects  you have to keep in mind and you have to think through and you have to communicate on a short  
**[1:04:47-1:04:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:47):**  term but also on a long term period.  And I think it's incredible what kind of not only thought process they have developed,  but also the kind of decisions that they took and quite, I guess there was a lot of discussions  
**[1:05:01-1:05:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:01):**  around them.  But this is so, this sounds very holistic if you ask me.  And I'm just really grateful that Thomas and his team have done this and are going through  
**[1:05:12-1:05:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:12):**  this.  And I think this has enormous potential.  I'm already looking forward to, you know, a couple of years time, we'll be like, you  
**[1:05:19-1:05:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:19):**  guys need to meet.  Yeah.  I spoke to Thomas back in the day when they only had like, I don't know, when he was still  
**[1:05:23-1:05:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:23):**  accessible, 8 million on the balance sheet.  So, you know, I think it's, there's going to be amazing times to come and Thomas and  that kind of thinking and those kinds of ways are going to have an incredible influence  
**[1:05:38-1:05:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:38):**  on this.  So, I think it's our task of all of us to basically make sure that this information  gets out and is being pushed and that we connect collectively, basically see that, you know,  
**[1:05:50-1:05:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:50):**  we can, we can grow this movement.  Yeah.  So, good stuff, Thomas.  
**[1:05:54-1:05:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:54):**  Thank you so much for being on the show.  Thank you.  Any final words, Thomas, on this episode?  
**[1:06:00-1:06:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:00):**  Well, I think what I didn't say at all this time is really my motivation to do all of  this.  And, you know, we're talking about a lot of numbers and that's just because this is the  
**[1:06:12-1:06:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:12):**  world we live in.  You know, we live in a world of numbers and metrics and regulations and this is, you know,  the things we have to deal with to make things work.  
**[1:06:22-1:06:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:22):**  But, you know, this really comes from a very deep place, our motivation.  And, you know, I studied economics and I was very disillusioned with the kind of picture  of humanity that is portrayed there.  
**[1:06:37-1:06:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:37):**  You know, this homo economic, the selfish human that is just working in self-interest.  I never believed that, you know, and when I got to know the comments, you know, Elinor  Ostrom, how she's just, you know, showing us that there is another way of working together.  
**[1:06:53-1:06:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:53):**  You know, there's a way to, you know, and it really works.  It has worked for hundreds of years, even thousands of years where communities have  managed their own resources.  
**[1:07:04-1:07:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:07:04):**  And so this is really a guiding star and to really enable young people and also, of course,  old people who are young at heart, who are connected really deeply in their hearts and  souls with the land, with the plants and the animals, and they want to enable communities  
**[1:07:25-1:07:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:07:25):**  to flourish.  That's the only place you can do that.  Yeah.  
**[1:07:29-1:07:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:07:29):**  So this is really what inspires me.  And this is why I love my work so much.  You know, I'm really glad.  
**[1:07:35-1:07:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:07:35):**  Even when you go through all the legal details in our numbers world at the moment.  And we salute you for that because it's work that should be done, has to be done.  I know you like it and enjoy it.  
**[1:07:45-1:07:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:07:45):**  But for some people like me, it's very difficult to imagine somebody enjoys that piece and  I see Benedict laughing, which means I think he thinks the same.  So thank you so much, both of you, for your time, your energy.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:07:56):**  I really hope you'll be able to meet soon in person, meaning visiting the farm of Benedict  and start dreaming and practicing and seeing what is possible there.  And we'll for sure be checking in on that.  
**[1:08:07-1:08:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:08:07):**  Thank you so much for your time this morning and have a great day.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.

Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:08:55-1:08:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:08:55):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:09:05-1:09:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:09:05):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:09:18-1:09:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:09:18):**  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[1:09:26-1:09:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:09:26):**  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in this space?  
**[1:09:31-1:09:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:09:31):**  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  
**[1:09:35-1:09:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:09:35):**  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course you, the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders,  people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders,  
**[1:09:47-1:09:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:09:47):**  crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture,  key line designers, holistic management consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[1:10:00-1:10:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:10:00):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital banks, insurance companies,  et cetera.  
**[1:10:11-1:10:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:10:11):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:10:15-1:10:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:10:15):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  
**[1:10:25-1:10:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:10:25):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:10:34):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:10:44-1:10:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:10:44):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky.  How to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest  
**[1:10:55-1:10:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:10:55):**  in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if  you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:11:05-1:11:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:11:05):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  
**[1:11:15-1:11:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:11:15):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:11:23-1:11:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:11:23):**  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on

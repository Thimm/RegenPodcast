**[0:00:12-0:00:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:13):**  What could the role of the crowd be in transition finance for farmers, not just to speed up  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:18):**  their regenerative practices, but also to transition from active farmer to retirement  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:22):**  and freeing up the land to the next generation, without selling out but still have a comfortable  
**[0:00:27-0:00:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:27):**  pension?  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:28):**  Now what could Benedict, who is absolutely not retiring, do by partnering with the crowd  
**[0:00:32-0:00:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:32):**  to free up capital to invest in his regenerative transition?  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:35):**  Listen to this interview with Thomas, who has enabled local regenerative farmers in  
**[0:00:39-0:00:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:39):**  Germany to raise over 4.5 million euros from the crowd.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:54):**  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:00:57):**  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:01):**  Why are we recording this series?  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:03):**  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:07):**  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the gurus on their  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:11):**  farms, explored farm-sized regenerative designs, and most importantly, started their pilots  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:16):**  and feedback loops.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:18):**  This is where transition finance is key.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:20):**  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of flexibility,  
**[0:01:25-0:01:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:25):**  and the farmer's lack of collateral.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:27):**  Furthermore, there's a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give away.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:33):**  That is why my co-host, aspiring-to-be regenerative farmer, Benedict Boesl, and I are embarking  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:39):**  on a journey to find out what are the key principles of transition finance for regenerative  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:44):**  farmers.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:45):**  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative agriculture and food finance  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:50):**  space.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:51):**  We share their insights how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative transition  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:01:55):**  on Benedict's 1000 hectares, which is almost 2,500 acres, farm in Germany close to Berlin.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:02):**  This is an open process.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:03):**  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:07):**  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:10):**  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other inspiration, people  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:15):**  to interview, et cetera.

**[0:02:27-0:02:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:27):**  Welcome to another Transition Finance for Farmers series episode.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:30):**  Today with Thomas Ripple, friend of the show who has been on here already twice.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:34):**  I think that's a new record and we're very happy to have him back and dive deep into  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:37):**  the crowd side of investing in regenerative agriculture and specifically transition finance  
**[0:02:41-0:02:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:41):**  for farmers.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:43):**  And obviously my co-host and partner in crime, Benedict Boesl.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:45):**  So welcome to both of you, Thomas and Benedict.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:48):**  Thank you, Carl.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:49):**  And thank you for having me on the show again.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:50):**  A lot has happened since we last talked.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:53):**  Indeed.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:54):**  Hi, Thomas.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:55):**  Great to have you.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:02:56):**  And to that, Thomas, can you, for anybody, I obviously linked the two interviews we did  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:00):**  before below in the show notes, but can you, I mean, you already alluded to a lot has happened  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:05):**  since we talked.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:07):**  If you had to pick one thing, it's very difficult because you operate on so many different chess  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:10):**  boards.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:11):**  What have you been busy with since the last time we talked, which was actually the beginning  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:14):**  or the end of last year.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:15):**  So the end of 2019 and what has been happening in the last six months apart from all the  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:20):**  craziness obviously?  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:21):**  Well, yeah, as you say, the last six months have been crazy for all of us and throughout  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:27):**  the world.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:28):**  But for us, actually, we have received a lot of positive attention and we have a lot more  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:35):**  new members and we're receiving more citizen capital than before the Corona crisis.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:40):**  So this is really a positive surprise.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:43):**  I was not sure how it's going to turn out.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:46):**  I was thinking maybe people are going to hold tight to their money, being afraid of economic  
**[0:03:52-0:03:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:52):**  consequences.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:53):**  But the opposite happened.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:03:54):**  We have a lot more people investing and making capital available because regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:04:04):**  local agriculture has been a big topic.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:04:08):**  We've heard all about the slaughterhouses that are in the news in Germany but in all  
**[0:04:15-0:04:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:04:15):**  over the world as big hubs of spreading Corona and the work conditions there and everything.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:04:24):**  So initiatives like ours are receiving positive attention.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:04:28):**  But besides that, what has happened in the past year is that we have now really started  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:04:32):**  to take over entire farms.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:04:36):**  So before, we were helping farms to secure the land that they have been mostly leasing  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:04:44):**  for a long time and then to buy it, so to secure it permanently.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:04:49):**  And now we are receiving a lot of requests from farmers who are retiring or want to retire  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:04:57):**  and don't have children who want to take over the farm and they want to hand it over to  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:03):**  the next generation.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:04):**  And this issue of them needing a retirement so that they can leave the farm, they need  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:10):**  money so they can leave the farm and buy themselves a house.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:13):**  They need a monthly retirement.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:15):**  And at the same time, the young people who come who want to take over farms, they don't  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:19):**  have the money to buy a farm and to pay a farm a retirement for the rest of their life.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:24):**  And this is where we have now started to play a big role.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:27):**  And this has really opened up a lot of new avenues and we're growing really quickly.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:33):**  So we're doubling our balance sheets this year.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:36):**  We're doubling the number of hectares we're taking over.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:40):**  And this has pushed us to think about how to create more decentralized structure to  
**[0:05:49-0:05:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:49):**  create a kind of heterarchical organization in the sense of Frederic Laloux from Reinventing  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:56):**  Organizations, the Teal Organization.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:57):**  That is our goal.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:05:58):**  We're actually reading that book together as a team.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:01):**  It's been a big inspiration for us.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:03):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:04):**  So basically, I mean, I can imagine the growth that happens because of that, because before  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:07):**  you were helping maybe relatively small farms to secure the land underneath their farm that  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:11):**  they've been farming for quite a while and that maybe came on the market or was threatened  
**[0:06:16-0:06:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:16):**  to be sold.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:17):**  And those are X amounts.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:19):**  And then now, because I think we talked about one of the first cases of the pension plan  
**[0:06:24-0:06:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:24):**  you're helping farmers with.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:25):**  Last time we talked, it was one or two maybe.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:28):**  But those are obviously complete farms, much larger amounts, real estate on it.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:32):**  So the amount of money flowing through the system is much bigger.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:34):**  But when you say we're taking over a lot of hectares, et cetera, can you describe in a  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:38):**  few sentences what we is or how do you take that over?  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:41):**  Because it sounds like a big between brackets, big land grabbing.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:45):**  We're going to own a lot of land, but it's completely the opposite of your intentions.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:48):**  So for anybody that didn't listen to the previous episodes, when you say we take over the land,  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:52):**  what does that entail?  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:53):**  Okay.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:54):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:55):**  So we see ourselves as the commons.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:06:57):**  So we are a community.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:07:01):**  We Kulturland-Ginossenschaft, we are a cooperative.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:07:04):**  And what we enable through our organization is that citizens pool their capital, and then  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:07:11):**  we make that capital available to secure land.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:07:14):**  And we have really worked out a legal structure for this where the ownership of land gets  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:07:22):**  neutralized in a way.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:07:24):**  So we take it out of a private capital and we turn it into a commons.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:07:28):**  So the idea is that the land never gets sold again.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:07:32):**  And we have really in a way invented a new type of ownership.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:07:37):**  So it's not private ownership, but it's also not the classical sense of community ownership,  
**[0:07:43-0:07:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:07:43):**  but rather the land gets removed from the ownership mind frame in a way the land belongs  
**[0:07:52-0:08:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:07:52):**  to itself, and then we make it available to those people who can be the best stewards  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:00):**  to the land.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:01):**  So just to give you a little bit of an idea of how we do this, it's a little bit complicated  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:07):**  if you've not dealt with this kind of structure before and we're the first ones to do it.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:14):**  But the way we do it is, so we are cooperative.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:16):**  We enable people to invest money by assigning shares in the cooperative.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:23):**  And then when a farm comes to us and wants to buy land and they can't afford it, or if  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:31):**  now a farmer wants to hand over his farm to the next generation so he can retire, then  
**[0:08:38-0:08:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:38):**  we form a legal entity with each farm and we become a stakeholder in that legal entity.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:46):**  And the farmer becomes the other stakeholder.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:48):**  And we both have a veto right, but the executive party actually is the farm.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:08:56):**  And so what we really do is we stipulate the criteria, which is that the land that we secure  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:04):**  has to be farmed organically or regeneratively.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:08):**  And I'm saying regeneratively because we have criteria beyond just organic.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:11):**  And actually we don't care about the organic label, but rather we care that the farm functions  
**[0:09:16-0:09:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:16):**  in a regional, regionally so that the farm either does regional marketing or community  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:24):**  support agriculture or is breeding local varieties and breeds or is working with school children.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:31):**  So it really is, it has a social aspect to it and it has a regional aspect.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:36):**  And 10% of the land has to be put aside for ecological reserve.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:43):**  So it should not be actively farmed, but it should be put aside for wildlife, birds and  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:50):**  so on.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:51):**  And so when we, let me give you an example so it's easier to understand.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:09:57):**  Let's say a 50 hectare farm that has been farming for many, many years and most of the  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:03):**  land, the farm is leased.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:06):**  And let's say 40 hectares of the land is leased and 10 hectare their own.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:10):**  And now the land owner of let's say 20 hectares of their land wants to sell it or the owner  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:17):**  died and the children, they inherited it and they want to sell the land.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:22):**  And now the farmer, he has to buy the land or he's going to lose it because once it's  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:29):**  sold then the new owner, he's going to want to lease it out for a higher price and so  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:34):**  on.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:35):**  And so this farm, they come to us and they ask us for help.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:39):**  And so what we do is we set up this new legal entity where the farm becomes the executive  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:45):**  party and we enable it to the community around the farm or regionally.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:52):**  We also do press work and then people hear about it to invest by assigning shares in  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:57):**  our cooperative.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:10:58):**  And then we take this money, we put it in this legal entity and then we buy the land  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:03):**  or actually we put the money in before because sometimes we need to buy the land quickly.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:09):**  So we make the money available, we secure the land and then we ask the people around  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:12):**  the farm to invest.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:15):**  And then this land is available in perpetuity.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:19):**  Or the 10 hectare farm that now suddenly is a bigger farm and more secure because suddenly  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:23):**  you can do things longer term that previously when you're leasing is risky and you cannot  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:29):**  really plan.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:31):**  And you know you can have access to this land as long as you're farming organically, regeneratively  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:35):**  and have your social role and not set up a big monoculture, big fattening facility on  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:41):**  top of it obviously.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:42):**  Exactly.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:43):**  So as long as you keep those criteria, the land is yours forever.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:47):**  And we also, you know, we even thought about the case, you know, let's say in 50 years,  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:52):**  all of the people who started this organization, they're gone and the next generation comes  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:11:57):**  and let's say they think, well, you know, now we can make a lot of money selling this  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:01):**  land.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:02):**  No, we don't want that.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:04):**  So what we do is we give the farms a – so if we would ever sell the land, then the farm  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:11):**  has a right of first refusal to buy the land but not for the current market price but for  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:17):**  the price that we bought it for back when we bought it.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:20):**  So let's say we decide to sell the land in 30 years, then they're paying the price that  
**[0:12:25-0:12:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:25):**  we paid now, right?  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:27):**  So basically they're getting it for a really, really cheap price.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:30):**  There is no incentive for us to ever sell the land.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:32):**  But say you don't know what happens in 30 years with the organization, with the people,  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:35):**  so you already safeguarded basically the organization and the land to forever stay in the commons,  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:42):**  not at least for as long as you could imagine and all the potentialities you could imagine  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:46):**  now.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:47):**  Obviously, we don't know what happens in the future but you try to take into consideration  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:50):**  everything that could happen and block it from any land-grabbing, high-exits, VELA development,  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:57):**  et cetera.  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:58):**  Stay Forever Exactly.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:12:59):**  Because I really believe humans are good beings by nature and we are able to create rules  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:07):**  that bring out the best in us but we all know this from ourselves and from other people  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:13):**  that when we are in a tight spot, we will sometimes act selfishly and that has very  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:17):**  long-term consequences.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:19):**  So if we thought about how we can set the rules, that kind of selfish behavior is not  
**[0:13:25-0:13:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:25):**  possible, at least in that with regard to the ownership of the land and then how we  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:33):**  make it available.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:34):**  Stay Forever Thomas, do you have any sort of control mechanisms  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:36):**  in there?  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:37):**  Because I mean if you have a smart investor that owns land, he would basically bring all  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:43):**  the land into your structure, then basically run the company, hopefully successfully, and  
**[0:13:49-0:13:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:49):**  then the time comes where you're like, okay, we might want to sell it.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:52):**  Do you want to buy it for this very cheap price?  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:13:54):**  He buys it back and he's made a good deal.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:00):**  So I think if you are that successful, that business model will scale, which I think all  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:06):**  of us will hope that it does.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:08):**  I think there has to be some sort of way of having a control mechanism.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:11):**  I don't know.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:12):**  What do you guys have in place?  
**[0:14:13-0:14:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:13):**  Stay Forever Well, absolutely.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:14):**  I mean this is something that's taken care of.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:18):**  So a cooperative in the legal sense in Germany, so the way it works is that each shareholder,  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:28):**  regardless of how many shares they have, only has one vote.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:32):**  This is by law.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:33):**  This is not something that a rule that we made up.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:35):**  This is by law.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:36):**  This is for every cooperative in Germany.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:38):**  So it really doesn't matter if an investor gives us 10 million, he only has one vote  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:43):**  and we have more than 700 members.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:45):**  So he really has nothing to say.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:47):**  But still we only allow investors to invest 5% of the total capital.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:53):**  If it's more than that, then we really want to get to know them very well and see who  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:14:57):**  they are because that's also a risk.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:00):**  If there's too much capital from one source, then they can also withdraw that capital and  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:04):**  then we might be in a tight spot and we don't want that.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:07):**  In the size of the group and the relatively small size of every individual investor, because  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:13):**  then of course the investor could pass away and the children might think very differently.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:16):**  And if they suddenly withdraw, like you mentioned, you can cripple an organization or a cooperative  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:21):**  like that.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:23):**  And actually we don't allow automatic inheritance of shares because we want the people to be  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:29):**  invested not just with their money, but with their hearts.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:32):**  So if it's inherited, then there's, of course, you know, they're not disowned, they still  
**[0:15:37-0:15:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:37):**  own the shares, but it's a transition period.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:40):**  And then we can approve them as new members.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:43):**  But if we don't, then we will pay them out.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:46):**  There's no automatic right to join the community.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:48):**  Super interesting.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:49):**  You know, I think that whenever you start new ways on new thinking, there's a couple  
**[0:15:54-0:16:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:15:54):**  of risks and possibilities that could possibly go wrong involved.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:00):**  But I'm always much more interested in the potential and the things that do work.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:05):**  So if I was a young farmer seeking land or seeking a way into farming, could I basically  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:13):**  make an appointment with you, Thomas, and be like, look, what do you have?  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:16):**  You know, I don't care where.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:17):**  I just need land and then I can get going.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:20):**  How could that process look?  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:22):**  Is that something that you guys offer?  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:23):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:24):**  I'm glad you mentioned that.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:26):**  So now that we have been taking over entire farms, let me give you two examples of farms  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:31):**  that we have recently taken over.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:34):**  The one is a 70 hectare farm east of Dortmund.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:41):**  Most of it is crop land, quite fertile, and it has three houses on it with more than 400  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:52):**  square meters of room to live.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:55):**  So maybe at least two, maybe three families could live there.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:16:59):**  And the person who was farming this land, he's retiring.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:04):**  It's a seventh generation farm.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:06):**  They have been farming for more than 200 years there.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:10):**  And his children, they don't want to take over the farm.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:14):**  But this is his life's work.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:16):**  This is his family's generational work.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:21):**  And he has been farming for more than 30 years biodynamically.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:25):**  And so he wants to pass it on to a next generation that wants to continue in this spirit.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:31):**  And for him, he didn't look at the market price.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:34):**  And the market price would be maybe 2.5 million.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:36):**  He didn't look at that.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:37):**  He said, look, what I need is 150,000 euros to buy myself a house to leave the farm and  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:42):**  2,000 euros a month retirement.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:46):**  And that, for somebody retirement age, 2,000 a month for the rest of his life, that's maybe  
**[0:17:52-0:17:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:52):**  4,000 or 500,000 euros.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:53):**  So what he's asking for is basically 5,000, 600,000 euros for a farm that's worth at least  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:17:59):**  2.5 million.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:01):**  So that's very generous.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:02):**  And we pass on this generosity.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:06):**  Because we get it so cheaply in a way, we can pass it on to the next generation very  
**[0:18:11-0:18:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:11):**  cheaply in a way.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:12):**  So then now we are setting up a kind of round table or a video conference where we ask people  
**[0:18:26-0:18:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:26):**  who are passing or retiring and want to pass on their farms and young farmers who are looking  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:33):**  for farms, we bring them together.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:36):**  And we are asking people to apply for this farm.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:39):**  And we have some people interested.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:41):**  But we need to get the word out.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:43):**  Because obviously not everybody knows about this.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:45):**  And we have another wonderful farm like this.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:47):**  It's an 80 hectare farm close to Hannover.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:52):**  It has soils with 95 soil points.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:18:57):**  So in Germany, they classify the soils from 0 to 100 points.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:01):**  100 is like you stick your seed in and the next day you can harvest basically.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:06):**  So 95 is pretty good.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:08):**  95 is pretty good.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:09):**  And so he's also retiring and he's passing it on.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:12):**  And he also is asking for a certain amount so he can buy himself a house outside.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:19):**  And he's also asking for 2,000 euros a month.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:21):**  And that's it.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:22):**  And there's many.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:23):**  I'm going to another farm on Friday.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:26):**  And there's a few other farms.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:27):**  And so it's just really been taking off.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:29):**  And all of these farms, we really are looking for young farmers to take over.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:34):**  And this is so incredible.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:36):**  I get goosebumps when you tell this story.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:38):**  Because I mean this is just so desperately needed.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:41):**  And there's just such an amazing potential.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:43):**  Because especially also in Germany, you have all the discussion about young people not  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:47):**  wanting to get into farming.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:49):**  People that not want to take over farms.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:51):**  And what you guys are on and what I see for this, it's really what I always try to tell  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:19:58):**  people as well that when it comes to land use and having access to land, it's not always  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:04):**  just primary production.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:06):**  There's so much more to this.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:07):**  There's so much more value.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:08):**  There's so much more potential business models.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:10):**  And when you tell from those different farms in this different context, it's not just a  
**[0:20:15-0:20:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:15):**  farmer that you're looking for.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:16):**  It's also someone that wants to extract colors from natural produce or that wants to make  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:22):**  deodorants or that wants to have a leather factory or whatever.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:25):**  And you can bring these people together on the farms in those kind of communities.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:30):**  And these are going to be hotspots of growth and of creativity and of a future and hope.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:35):**  So yeah, it's amazing.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:38):**  Do you see that, Thomas?  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:39):**  Yeah, I think it's very interesting.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:41):**  Because you mentioned something very interesting from the biodynamic farmer.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:44):**  You're stuck constantly, you're talking in singular.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:47):**  And then you said this house can probably or this square meters can probably host three  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:52):**  families.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:53):**  And then there's three families potentially also living off the farm somehow, the food,  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:57):**  the fibers, the oils.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:20:58):**  Like could a farm like that 70 hectares or 80 hectares support more than just one family?  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:03):**  And if so, then suddenly we sort of quadruple the potential, at least social impact.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:08):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:09):**  And I'm glad you mentioned that the potential of creativity just explodes when you don't  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:15):**  have the bank sitting in your neck.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:20):**  And the banks, they only understand classical production models.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:23):**  They're not going to give you a loan if you tell them you're going to do a community supported  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:28):**  farm.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:29):**  They don't even understand what that is.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:30):**  They're going to give you a loan if you say you build an industry, you know, pig stable.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:34):**  And so if you don't have that financial pressure, then all of these creative potentials are  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:39):**  unlocked and you can try different things.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:41):**  And we see this, especially with community supported farms, most of the farms that we  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:46):**  buy land with, they are community supported farms.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:49):**  Literally, because the community invests.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:51):**  So it absolutely makes sense.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:53):**  But these two farms that I just mentioned, you know, it's up to the next generation,  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:21:56):**  whether they want to make it a community supported farm or they find other ways with direct marketing,  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:01):**  whatever creative way they want to farm land.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:05):**  Let me just give you one example.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:07):**  One of our farms is close to Freiburg, Lucerne and Hölf.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:10):**  We also took over that farm as a whole.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:13):**  And now it's the first, if I remember from our first interview.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:16):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:17):**  So it was the first farm and I was working and living there as well.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:21):**  I was part of that team that was farming there.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:27):**  And I was just had a small role because I was doing my work for Kötülängen Osenjöf.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:33):**  But I'm, of course, a trained farmer as well.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:36):**  And it's my passion and I really love living on a farm.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:40):**  But yeah, so on that farm, it's 33 hectares.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:44):**  And they produce about three hectares of vegetables, about 10 hectares of grains.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:52):**  They make cheeses and different milk products and so on.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:22:56):**  And of course, there's animals, there's pigs, there's, you know, calves and all of that  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:06):**  goes to the community.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:07):**  There's 200 families as members of that community supported farm.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:11):**  And they manage to support not just one person.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:17):**  So in Germany now, you could maybe support not even one family with this, with 33 hectares.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:25):**  So you would on average need 60 hectares to support one family.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:29):**  Okay, conventional model, 60 hectares to support one family and probably one of the family  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:34):**  members needs to work off farm to make it work.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:38):**  And on Lüzsen and Höf, it supports 10 full-time positions.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:41):**  Wow.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:42):**  Right.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:43):**  So this is the kind of factor we're talking about.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:46):**  It's at least a factor of 10.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:48):**  If you're, you know, really doing a lot of value-added things on your farm, you know,  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:23:54):**  they also make breads, they make milk products, they're a diversified farm and so on.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:00):**  And then you don't get, let's say, 20, 30 cents a liter for conventional milk, but you're  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:08):**  turning the milk into high-quality cheese and then you're getting, on the value of the  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:13):**  milk, you're getting like three euros per liter of milk in terms of actual value, right?  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:19):**  So this is what's possible.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:22):**  And this would be my vision for the future of farming, at least close to populated areas.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:29):**  So I'm thinking, you know, anywhere where there's people, you can have community-supported  
**[0:24:34-0:24:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:34):**  farming.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:35):**  If it's really in the middle of nowhere, then of course, community-supported farming is  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:39):**  not going to be a model that works.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:41):**  And you know, that's not what I'm saying, but I think there's other very interesting  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:46):**  models for that as well.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:47):**  Yeah, super, super interesting.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:49):**  The factor 10 is just very impressive going from one niche on 33 hectares, or in 60 hectares  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:24:58):**  actually to 10 full-time.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:00):**  It's actually a factor of 20 almost.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:01):**  It's crazy what that could support, which means these farms of 60, 70 hectares or 80  
**[0:25:06-0:25:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:06):**  hectares you just described, obviously in a different situation, different local community,  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:09):**  completely different circumstances, but theoretically they could support a number of families relatively  
**[0:25:14-0:25:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:14):**  easily if they have local, relatively local markets to supply and obviously the entrepreneurial  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:21):**  creativity to do that.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:22):**  But it opens up because sort of the historic, and maybe you see that now as well, because  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:27):**  you're having a lot of these retirement discussions, the historic biodynamic or organic is still  
**[0:25:32-0:25:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:32):**  one family.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:33):**  It's not really operating the farm as a platform for multiple families.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:36):**  And a lot of the CSA of community-supported agriculture ones I know are much more broad,  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:41):**  much more flat and much more as a platform.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:44):**  So Thomas, could you talk us through the process?  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:48):**  If I decide, look, you know, I need to take more risk and I need more capital for that,  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:53):**  and I would be thinking of bringing in some of our land into your organization, what would  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:25:59):**  be the steps, what would be the timeframe, what would I have to know and keep in mind  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:03):**  and how would we then basically come together and work together?  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:07):**  And what would it enable you to do?  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:09):**  Well, I know the answer to that.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:12):**  Right.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:13):**  Well, I can't answer the second part, but I can tell you what it would look like.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:17):**  And I'm glad you're asking that because when we worked on building this organization, you  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:25):**  as a person, the type of farm that you're running was really what we had in mind.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:30):**  And so you could already in a way start the generational transition process where you  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:35):**  bring maybe piece by piece or if you wanted to, you could bring all of your land basically  
**[0:26:41-0:26:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:41):**  into this kind of mutualized ownership form and then we could raise community capital  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:48):**  on that land.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:50):**  So let's say you just want to start with a patch of your land and you want to do something  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:55):**  special there, maybe permaculture or something.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:26:59):**  So let's say you put just 10 hectares of land aside for that, then we create this legal  
**[0:27:06-0:27:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:27:06):**  entity as I mentioned for those who know the German, know what it means.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:27:14):**  It's a kommanditgesellschaft.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:27:17):**  You become the komplementer, which is the executive party.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:27:21):**  And we are kommanditist, which is in a way the investing party.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:27:27):**  And so then the community around your farm, and you have a very strong community, you  
**[0:27:32-0:27:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:27:32):**  have a very broad reach, they can then participate by signing shares and then this money, let's  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:27:41):**  say the land has a value low balling here, let's say 10,000 euros per hectare, then we  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:27:47):**  can raise 100,000 euros on this land.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:27:51):**  And you as the owner of the land, you put the land into this legal entity.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:27:56):**  We buy the land from you in a way and then the land is still available to you, but you  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:00):**  don't own it anymore.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:01):**  You can still farm it as long as you farm it regeneratively.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:05):**  You can use it forever.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:07):**  But at the same time, you have 100,000 euros available to then invest in whatever you want  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:11):**  to do on the land.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:12):**  Let's say you want to plant some kind of agroforestry and you have investment costs and so on, then  
**[0:28:17-0:28:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:17):**  you can cover those costs with that money.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:19):**  And you pay a rent as the then user no longer owner to the organization.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:24):**  How does that work?  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:25):**  Right.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:26):**  So interesting question.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:27):**  So until last year, what we did was that we asked the farmers what they want to pay basically.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:33):**  So we agreed on a lease on a yearly basis, something between 150 to 400 euros per hectare,  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:41):**  which is much below market price, but still in a way a classical model where we're asking  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:47):**  a fixed price.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:48):**  And we wanted to move away from that.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:50):**  And we started a new advisory board where all of our farmers are members and we asked  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:28:56):**  them how we could come up with a better way to organize this.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:00):**  And we took the community-supported agriculture as our guiding star.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:07):**  Most community-supported farms in Germany, what they do is they have a budget that they  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:13):**  need to cover to run their operations.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:15):**  And then they ask the members what they want to pay.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:19):**  So it's not a fixed amount, but rather each member can in a way place a bid, then that's  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:24):**  what they pay.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:25):**  And so this is what we're doing now.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:27):**  So the farms, they are not asked to pay a fixed price, but rather we say, look, to run  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:32):**  our operations, obviously we need operational capital.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:36):**  We have employees.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:40):**  One of them is me.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:41):**  And I also need to make a living.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:44):**  And so we communicate transparently what that budget is.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:50):**  And then the farms, they cover that budget collectively.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:52):**  And each farm is free to pay whatever is possible for them.  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:57):**  Transparently.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:29:58):**  So I can see what the others are paying or not.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:02):**  It's transparent what our costs are.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:04):**  We have not decided yet how transparent we want to be about how much each farm pays.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:07):**  So you would see that farm A paid so much, but do we want to label farm A as in Sandenhof  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:13):**  or do we want to keep it in a way semi-anonymous?  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:18):**  We haven't decided on that, but this is how we're doing it.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:22):**  Starting next year.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:23):**  And then if a farm…  
**[0:30:26-0:30:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:26):**  So what we need is about 200 euros per hectare, which as you can probably test to Benedict  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:33):**  is very low for a lease in Germany.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:37):**  And as we grow, that probably gets even lower because we get more hectares and we don't  
**[0:30:45-0:30:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:45):**  need to hire that many more people.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:47):**  So that's how we operate.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:49):**  And this is how you could… or if you're leasing land, I don't know how much land  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:53):**  you own and how much you lease.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:55):**  If one of the owners of the land that you're leasing from wants to sell the land and you  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:30:59):**  don't have the capital to buy it, then also this is what we can do.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:03):**  We create this legal entity, Komonditgeseschoff, and then we put the money in to buy the land  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:08):**  and then we ask for the community to participate financially and then secure it long term.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:14):**  And as an investor, what do I get?  
**[0:31:16-0:31:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:16):**  Good question.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:17):**  What you get is being part of a wonderful community and supporting regenerative local  
**[0:31:23-0:31:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:23):**  farming and you get a lot of returns in terms of social capital and we're storing a lot  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:32):**  of carbon in the soil by building up CO2 and that has a huge value in creating biodiversity  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:38):**  and so on.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:39):**  But we're not paying any financial returns.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:41):**  No dividends and the shares are not increasing in value.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:46):**  And nonetheless, even though we don't pay financial returns, we have been able to raise  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:50):**  quite a few million euros now.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:54):**  How many at the moment?  
**[0:31:55-0:32:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:31:55):**  So we're currently at about 4.5 million and by the end of the year, we're about 7.5 million.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:04):**  And yeah, so one of the things actually that I'm working on is lobbying for better support  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:10):**  on a political level for what we're doing here.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:13):**  And I'm looking to France, how they're doing it.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:15):**  There's an organization there that we have learned a lot from, Terre de lien.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:20):**  They're doing something similar to what we're doing.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:23):**  And the French government had created a law 10 years ago where they created a label for  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:30):**  social companies.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:32):**  And you're a social company if the income gap between the highest and lowest income  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:36):**  is 7 to 1 and you state in your articles of incorporation that you have a social purpose  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:43):**  and a few other criteria, but it's not that complicated.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:46):**  And if you are labeled as a social company, as we obviously are, and maybe you could expand  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:52):**  that label to not just social but ecological, then in France, if you as a citizen invest  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:32:57):**  money up to 20,000 euros, you can deduct that from your income tax.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:02):**  You have to keep that capital in the company for five years and then you can take it out.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:06):**  So just as a quick calculation example, in Germany, the highest tax bracket is 42%.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:16):**  And let's say you are in that highest tax bracket.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:19):**  Let's say you invest 20,000 euros.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:21):**  Then you're saving that 42% tax and then five years later you can take that money out.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:26):**  So just in terms of financial returns, you would have made about 8% per year.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:31):**  Now, compared to our 0% today, that's really attractive and I'm sure that we would have  
**[0:33:37-0:33:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:37):**  a lot more citizens wanting to invest money if we would get this kind of tax break.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:45):**  I really hope that we can convince the government that this is something they should do because  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:50):**  now, in times of corona, we want more citizen participation.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:54):**  We want more investing in regenerative anything, right?  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:33:59):**  And we know that the climate crisis is happening and we need transition finance, especially  
**[0:34:05-0:34:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:05):**  in farming.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:06):**  And we're better to generate that transition finance than from citizens, right?  
**[0:34:11-0:34:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:11):**  So why not create tax breaks?  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:13):**  Why should citizens pay taxes on money that they're investing in this kind of transition?  
**[0:34:19-0:34:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:19):**  To me, it just makes sense, right?  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:21):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:22):**  And I mean, think about the potential of capital flowing into the sector.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:27):**  I mean, this is just incredible.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:29):**  The only thing is obviously that when it comes to the whole lobbying part and politicians  
**[0:34:35-0:34:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:35):**  and everything that's in front or behind that, they have that money calculated in different  
**[0:34:42-0:34:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:42):**  areas and to make them understand the potential and maybe also, let's say, the economic potential  
**[0:34:49-0:34:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:49):**  that comes out of it, but also the social possibilities, also costs that they can save.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:34:56):**  It's in some sense, it is comparable to changing your style of agriculture to regenerative  
**[0:35:05-0:35:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:05):**  where you not only create values on different areas, but you also have an economic benefit  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:13):**  because you're not only able to have additional incomes, but you also reduce your costs.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:18):**  So this is actually interesting, the thought process to bring through a politician who  
**[0:35:23-0:35:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:23):**  obviously by definition thinks rather short term than long term.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:30):**  But I mean, you're right.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:32):**  It would be a relatively simple step to basically change that whole system and imagine what  
**[0:35:39-0:35:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:39):**  would be possible if we did.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:41):**  Is that a bottleneck now, Thomas?  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:43):**  Like the flow of money for you guys specifically, or is the bottleneck the farms you can find  
**[0:35:49-0:35:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:49):**  or the land or the farmers?  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:51):**  What would be the biggest leverage point to unlock a lot of these?  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:55):**  Well, a year ago I would have said, no, it's not a bottleneck.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:35:59):**  But now that we have so many requests by farms, I would say, yes, it is becoming a bottleneck.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:04):**  And we, until now, have been able to fund all of the land purchases through community  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:11):**  capital that we raised from individual citizens.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:13):**  But now for the first time, we're taking up a larger loan from the Triodos Bank, actually.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:18):**  Friend of the show, first interview of the series.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:20):**  Yeah, I hope they're listening in because they're supposed to send us the offer this  
**[0:36:25-0:36:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:25):**  week.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:26):**  I hope that the interest rate is nice.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:29):**  I cannot promise to have it out within a week, Thomas, that they can hear this, but we can  
**[0:36:33-0:36:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:33):**  reach out to our friends.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:34):**  Yeah, so I mean, you know, in these days…  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:37):**  That's interesting that you're interacting with the, I wouldn't say the old world because  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:41):**  definitely Triodos is not part of the old world, but it's a bank and that's almost  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:46):**  by definition part of an older world and interesting that you're now interacting with that part  
**[0:36:52-0:36:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:52):**  of the financial sector, let's say.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:54):**  Well, yeah, and I have no problem with that.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:55):**  I think it's, you know, it's absolutely fine.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:36:58):**  We have so much equity, you know, we don't have any outstanding loans.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:01):**  So, you know, there's no problem with taking on loans to fund land purchases.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:08):**  But ideally, I would like to be in the situation that Terene et Lien is in France, where they  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:13):**  have raised more than 100 million euros by now.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:17):**  And in France, actually, pension funds, they have to invest 5% of their capital in these  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:24):**  social labeled companies.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:27):**  And they have more than 200 million euros in capital lined up.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:32):**  And they said, well, they don't want to take on that much institutional capital.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:37):**  So they have limited that to 20% because they want this to be a citizen movement.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:41):**  Which means they go to a billion, very simply.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:44):**  They're heading for a billion and that's, you know, I would love to be in that situation.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:48):**  Yeah, but they have a few more years, I think, under their belt.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:52):**  It's not that fresh, but it's interesting what's happening there.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:55):**  Also, Thomas, I was going to ask you on this also, you know, going back to an idea that  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:37:59):**  I could be able to bring some of our land into your organization.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:03):**  You know, what is the sort of the time requirement on my side when it comes to not only, you  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:09):**  know, speaking to my community and my network to basically try to raise the money, but also  
**[0:38:15-0:38:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:15):**  maybe sort of, you know, accounting things and organizational things that go around,  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:21):**  how much of the, you know, the pre-work are you guys doing?  
**[0:38:26-0:38:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:26):**  How much am I doing?  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:27):**  Because obviously time is just like the biggest constraint of all of them.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:30):**  So having money lined up, being able to move in fast would obviously be something that  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:35):**  would be so like appealing to me because that means I don't have to really do so much about  
**[0:38:40-0:38:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:40):**  it, right?  
**[0:38:41-0:38:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:41):**  Well, yeah, you're not the exception there, right?  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:44):**  So the farmers, they are not known to have a lot of time on their hands.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:49):**  So we really do all of the administrative work.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:53):**  So we create this legal entity and, you know, that might sound like a lot of work, but it's  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:57):**  not.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:38:58):**  So we do all of that because that legal entity is only holding the land.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:02):**  It's not active in an economic sense.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:05):**  So it's just copy paste in terms of doing the accounting, you know, on a yearly basis.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:11):**  We do all of that and the contracts and going to the authorities for the approval and this  
**[0:39:16-0:39:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:16):**  and that.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:17):**  We do all of that.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:18):**  All you have to then do is to go when the purchase contract is being signed in front  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:26):**  of the notary, you are the person going there to sign that purchase contract, not us, because  
**[0:39:31-0:39:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:31):**  you are the executive party and that legal entity.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:33):**  So it's your signature.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:35):**  And when you then, you know, lease, so the land lease, interestingly, is you leasing  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:41):**  the land to yourself.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:43):**  So the lease contract, you sign as Lease C and Lease Sir.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:47):**  So we're basically just in there.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:49):**  It's a very tough negotiation.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:51):**  We're just there to set the frame.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:53):**  You know, we say organic regenerative local farming, right?  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:39:57):**  And as long as you do that, the land is yours and you can do with it what you want for as  
**[0:40:02-0:40:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:02):**  long as you want, right?  
**[0:40:04-0:40:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:04):**  And in terms of, you know, if you were to come to us and say, look, here's 10 hectares,  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:10):**  then obviously we'll have a look at how your farm is set up and whether, you know, we believe  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:15):**  that there is a community because you're just a farm in the middle of nowhere.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:18):**  You're producing monoculture corn for some industrial production.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:23):**  Then it's really tough for us to raise community capital.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:25):**  But what if the farmer would be interested to transition?  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:29):**  Is that something like the conventional to, sorry, let's finish this part and let's go  
**[0:40:33-0:40:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:33):**  to that.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:34):**  Like, I'm interested if that's happening.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:36):**  Well, we have one example there, actually, I can give you an example of where we have  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:40):**  actually done that, where we bought 15 hectares of land in the middle of a monoculture desert.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:45):**  And the reason we did it is because there was young people who were super committed.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:49):**  They said they wanted to do community supported farming and we believed in them and we said,  
**[0:40:53-0:40:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:53):**  okay, then we do it, right?  
**[0:40:54-0:40:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:54):**  But we have to believe that it's possible.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:40:57):**  And in your case, obviously, it's possible.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:00):**  So then from the time that you decide you want to do it to the time where everything  
**[0:41:06-0:41:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:06):**  is signed and sealed, it can be as short as two months.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:12):**  But usually for, you know, for a case where a farmer is handing over his farm and, you  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:20):**  know, we're looking for the next generation and there's, you know, he still has to maybe  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:25):**  buy his house to leave the farm and there's a lot of questions regarding his, you know,  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:30):**  his children.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:31):**  They might still want to get inheritance and in Germany, the law is that children have  
**[0:41:37-0:41:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:37):**  a right to inheritance a certain amount.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:40):**  And so you need to find an agreement with the children and so on.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:43):**  And even if there's no agreement, then there's others, you know, avenues.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:47):**  So this process usually takes more than a year, I would say one to two years.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:52):**  But if the situation is more clear, like in your case, then I would say two months.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:41:58):**  But normally, because you know, you need to go there, we need to get to know each other  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:02):**  and this and that.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:03):**  Normally it takes four to six months.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:06):**  And that includes the raising.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:07):**  So includes to get to rally the community of Benedict or, or you're actually saying  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:13):**  in some cases, you have the capital available to quickly move and then you raise from the  
**[0:42:18-0:42:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:18):**  community.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:19):**  We generally have the capital available before.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:21):**  So we put in the money, but we want a commitment from the farm, from the community.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:27):**  So what we're asking for is a non-legally binding commitment from people that they are  
**[0:42:33-0:42:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:33):**  willing to put up at least a third of the capital.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:36):**  And then once we bought it and you know, we already put up the money, then we're asking  
**[0:42:39-0:42:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:39):**  for people to put in the money.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:42):**  And they can get out at some point, like as an investor, it's, we're talking about investing  
**[0:42:46-0:42:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:46):**  here.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:47):**  It's not a donation.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:48):**  You're investing, obviously you're getting a ton of non-financial returns, but you're  
**[0:42:52-0:42:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:52):**  also able at some, I mean, if I remember correctly, after a certain amount of years, you're able  
**[0:42:58-0:43:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:42:58):**  to sell your shares of the co-op for the value that you bought them, I think, because there's  
**[0:43:02-0:43:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:02):**  no value increase obviously of the shares.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:04):**  Yes, that's right.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:05):**  So after five years, you're allowed to give back your share, so to say, or at any time  
**[0:43:11-0:43:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:11):**  you're allowed to sell your shares to another member.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:13):**  So not somebody outside the community.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:15):**  If it's somebody outside the community, then we need to approve it.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:18):**  But you're allowed to sell your shares at any time to another member, or you give them  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:21):**  back to us after five years, and then we give you back your money.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:25):**  And in Germany, it's by law that a cooperative, that the value of the shares of the cooperatives  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:32):**  remain nominally constant.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:35):**  So the idea of a cooperative structure is that you raise capital within the community  
**[0:43:42-0:43:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:42):**  to do something that benefits the community.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:47):**  And so there's no sense in having increases in share values like you have in a stock holding  
**[0:43:55-0:43:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:55):**  company.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:43:56):**  So the value that, the internal value, let's say the value of the land rises, that remains  
**[0:44:01-0:44:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:01):**  within the company, but you can't take it out with the shares.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:05):**  And that's actually by law, and I think that makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:09):**  And that includes inflation or not?  
**[0:44:12-0:44:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:12):**  So you will lose money through inflation.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:14):**  The value remains nominally constant.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:17):**  We could choose to pay a dividend, but we choose not to because the money, the land  
**[0:44:23-0:44:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:23):**  values is so astronomical, land costs on average 30,000 euros in some areas up to 100,000 euros  
**[0:44:31-0:44:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:31):**  now.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:32):**  And if you look at how much a farmer can earn farming his land, on average an organic farm  
**[0:44:39-0:44:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:39):**  earns about 480 euros per hectare and a conventional farm about 420 euros per hectare.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:46):**  So if you compare that to the value of the land, that's maybe 1.3 to 1.5%.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:52):**  Now, we are asking in terms of the lease, so to say, that farms are paying, that's between  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:44:57):**  0.6 and 1.5%.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:00):**  And we need that to run our operation for overhead.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:04):**  So there's nothing left over to pay dividends.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:06):**  It doesn't really make sense.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:07):**  One more question regarding the model.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:12):**  For example, we often have many visitors or volunteers and interns, and some of which  
**[0:45:19-0:45:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:19):**  by the end of the internship, we get on so well and there's so many possibilities and  
**[0:45:24-0:45:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:24):**  thoughts and ideas that we can do.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:26):**  Like we basically start a side project or a side business.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:31):**  And it's often always involved with a capital investment.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:35):**  Now, there could be a possibility of basically using your model, bringing in some of the  
**[0:45:41-0:45:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:41):**  land, basically thereby raising capital, which then would obviously be leased by me again.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:48):**  But then I could basically lease it to the ex-intern, for example, and at the same time  
**[0:45:54-0:45:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:54):**  make it available for him or her.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:45:57):**  And he or she could then also use the capital, for example, to invest in a greenhouse or  
**[0:46:02-0:46:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:02):**  whatever.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:03):**  So, first of all, first question, is that possible?  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:05):**  Because this would be important to me because, I mean, it's my home.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:09):**  So I wouldn't want to give it to someone for 30, 50 years without having an idea of, are  
**[0:46:15-0:46:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:15):**  they going to kick my dog or whatever.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:18):**  So that's one thing.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:19):**  And the other thing is thinking about an investment that goes with it.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:23):**  Are you already thinking about that step where it's not only about the land, but maybe also  
**[0:46:28-0:46:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:28):**  adding an additional sum of investment that basically could be a technical greenhouse  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:37):**  that is then not only 100,000K if we think about that model, but maybe 200,000.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:42):**  All right.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:43):**  So let me answer the first part.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:46):**  So if the land belongs to you and we talked about this before, if you need capital to  
**[0:46:54-0:47:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:46:54):**  invest in order to enable a transition or enable a new person to farm that land, then  
**[0:47:02-0:47:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:02):**  absolutely, this is possible.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:05):**  You sell the land and you neutralize through our structure and you neutralize the ownership  
**[0:47:11-0:47:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:11):**  and then your land is still available and then you can absolutely make that available  
**[0:47:16-0:47:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:16):**  to whoever you trust.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:22):**  But then you are legally required to make sure that they keep the requirements, which  
**[0:47:27-0:47:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:27):**  is obviously regenerative local farming.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:31):**  But as long as you do that, it's up to you.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:33):**  The land is still within your full perfume.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:38):**  There's no restrictions.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:39):**  I mean, yes, this is the restriction, but beyond that, there's no restriction.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:43):**  You can do whatever you want with the land and make it available to anyone you want.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:48):**  So to your second question with regard to buying or investing in greenhouses or so on,  
**[0:47:54-0:47:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:54):**  that's tricky because we don't want to be the owners of greenhouses.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:47:57):**  So we can make capital available, as I just said, and then you can buy the greenhouse.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:03):**  But just recently, because when we take over a whole farm, obviously there's buildings  
**[0:48:08-0:48:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:08):**  on there and we need to take them as well.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:11):**  But the way we do it is we take the farm as a whole, but then when we pass it on to the  
**[0:48:15-0:48:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:15):**  next generation, the ownership of the land stays within our structure.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:21):**  So that's in this commons legal framework and the buildings, they are tied to it through  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:31):**  a long-term lease, which is called an erpahrt.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:35):**  So we sell the buildings, but it's still tied to the land through a 99-year lease contract.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:40):**  And as part of this contract, we stipulate the criteria that you as the owner of the  
**[0:48:45-0:48:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:45):**  buildings and you living there in those buildings have to also farm the land.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:51):**  So you can't decide to stop farming, but still live there.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:54):**  So it's still tied together.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:48:56):**  And we also make the contract so that even though you're the owner of the buildings,  
**[0:49:04-0:49:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:04):**  when you pass it on to the next generation, you can obviously sell it, but you can only  
**[0:49:08-0:49:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:08):**  sell it for a reasonable price, which is an objective measure.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:14):**  So you can't stop the transition to the next generation by asking for a ridiculous  
**[0:49:19-0:49:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:19):**  price.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:21):**  And so we enable this kind of transition finance by also buying the buildings.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:24):**  And then we sell the buildings for very, very, very cheap prices in the next generation.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:31):**  And for example, the farmer mentioned worth $2.5 million, including the buildings and  
**[0:49:36-0:49:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:36):**  everything he's giving us for $650,000.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:39):**  Then we don't need to ask a lot of money for the buildings.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:42):**  So we just sell it for a super low price, but still something because I think you still  
**[0:49:48-0:49:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:48):**  own the buildings.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:49):**  And that's a real value that you're getting.  
**[0:49:52-0:50:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:49:52):**  And you don't have an issue to get a loan from the bank for a very good interest rate.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:00):**  So you're paying less than 1%.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:02):**  And why shouldn't you, let's say the buildings are worth half a million, and then we give  
**[0:50:06-0:50:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:06):**  it to you for $250,000.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:08):**  Why shouldn't you pay $250,000 for that if you're getting half a million worth?  
**[0:50:12-0:50:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:12):**  Because then one day you will be able to sell it again.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:15):**  So this is how we're thinking.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:17):**  Maybe through feedback and different experiences we'll change our thinking on this, but currently  
**[0:50:21-0:50:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:21):**  this is how we are.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:22):**  So what happens if we basically go through the process and then I want to take a loan,  
**[0:50:27-0:50:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:27):**  which then as a security I would usually bring in the land that I have, which I've just basically  
**[0:50:33-0:50:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:33):**  sold to you.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:34):**  How does that work?  
**[0:50:36-0:50:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:36):**  Well that's not possible because you can't take a loan with the land as a security because  
**[0:50:43-0:50:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:43):**  you need our approval now.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:44):**  And we're not going to give that approval because we don't want the land to be sold  
**[0:50:47-0:50:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:47):**  again.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:48):**  And if your farm doesn't operate well and whatever, and then the bank would come and  
**[0:50:54-0:50:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:54):**  take the land, then the land would be lost.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:56):**  This is something that we don't want.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:50:58):**  So you can sell your land for a reasonable price.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:00):**  We're going to raise market value for it.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:04):**  But beyond that you can't leverage your land twice.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:06):**  That doesn't make sense.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:07):**  Well I wouldn't necessarily call it leveraging it twice.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:11):**  But it's just a process that you have to keep in mind because that's what happens in practical  
**[0:51:17-0:51:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:17):**  agriculture.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:18):**  You go to the bank, you get a loan and the security is the land.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:22):**  So it's a thought process that is obviously in there.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:26):**  And it's an option that you don't have anymore.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:30):**  And if we think back to the 10 hectare 100,000 euro example, it sounds like a lot of money  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:38):**  but it really isn't that much if you think about large changes in investments.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:43):**  It's gone pretty fast.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:44):**  So it's a relevant question.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:48):**  Well I'm glad you mentioned it because of course this is also a relevant question for  
**[0:51:52-0:51:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:52):**  the farms that we work with.  
**[0:51:54-0:52:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:51:54):**  And the wonderful thing is that we here have a community that obviously is willing to invest  
**[0:52:03-0:52:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:03):**  and take money in their hands.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:06):**  We built our own web platform.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:08):**  We programmed it ourselves.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:10):**  And each farm has its own website where you can go and you can choose to invest.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:16):**  And the farms are free to also use that to raise capital for themselves.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:20):**  And just to go back to the example of Hudson and Hove, they needed money to invest in new  
**[0:52:25-0:52:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:25):**  stables and cooling facilities and this and that.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:28):**  And they needed to raise something like I think 450,000.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:32):**  So they just put out the word and they said, look, we're willing to pay an interest rate  
**[0:52:37-0:52:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:37):**  of up to 1.5%.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:39):**  So 0 to 1.5, you're free to choose.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:42):**  And then people came and they gave loans and they raised the money in no time.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:47):**  It was over sign.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:48):**  It's amazing.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:49):**  But without the land as a security, I mean, that's what you're saying.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:52):**  Without using the land as a security, they got the money they needed.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:55):**  And they even had more money offered than they needed.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:52:57):**  So they could choose basically the lower interest offers.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:00):**  And in the end, they are paying an average of 0.6%, which no bank is going to give you  
**[0:53:05-0:53:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:05):**  a loan for less than 0.6%.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:09):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:10):**  It's just fantastic.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:11):**  I would love to get to know some of the investors into your structure.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:15):**  So could you just tell us, what are these kinds of people?  
**[0:53:19-0:53:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:19):**  Is there a certain type?  
**[0:53:20-0:53:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:20):**  Is it completely versatile?  
**[0:53:23-0:53:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:23):**  I'd love to hear some of those human stories behind it.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:29):**  Empirically we haven't, I can't tell you the average age or so on, but from my feeling  
**[0:53:33-0:53:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:33):**  and knowing a lot of them, I can tell you that the average age is probably around 40+,  
**[0:53:41-0:53:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:41):**  maybe 45 to 50, and obviously some older and obviously some younger.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:45):**  But this is the average age.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:47):**  And I would say a little bit more female than male.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:51):**  Noticable.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:53):**  And most of them, they have a direct connection to the farm.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:53:57):**  So 85% of people who was investing, they have a direct connection to the farm, either because  
**[0:54:03-0:54:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:03):**  they're buying products from there, they're a CSA member, or they have been to the farm,  
**[0:54:07-0:54:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:07):**  or they somehow have friends working there, or they visited the farm at one point.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:12):**  There's some kind of personal connection.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:14):**  And 15%, they don't have a personal connection, but they think this idea as such is really  
**[0:54:21-0:54:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:21):**  great.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:22):**  And those 15% are actually the ones that are willing to invest more money.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:26):**  So on average, the people, they give maybe five, well, the lowest amount is 500, and  
**[0:54:33-0:54:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:33):**  there's quite a few people who give 500 euros.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:36):**  But the average amount is about 3,000 euros if you don't take into consideration the people  
**[0:54:42-0:54:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:42):**  who give larger amounts, like 20,000 plus.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:47):**  And those 15% that don't have a direct connection to the farm, they just think this idea of  
**[0:54:53-0:54:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:53):**  land as a commons to make it available for the next generation for sustainable regenerative  
**[0:54:58-0:55:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:54:58):**  regional farming, they are usually the ones who are willing to put in larger sums between  
**[0:55:02-0:55:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:02):**  20,000 and 150,000.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:05):**  We even have one person that made a million available.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:08):**  So half of our capital is from those 15%.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:11):**  Half of our capital is from the 85%, right?  
**[0:55:13-0:55:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:13):**  Stay Forever Amazing.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:14):**  And I mean, going back to what you said about lobbying, I think those people, those investors,  
**[0:55:20-0:55:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:20):**  if investors are right term, but those people who see the value in this, I mean, they are  
**[0:55:27-0:55:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:27):**  one of your biggest strengths, I guess, right?  
**[0:55:31-0:55:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:31):**  So I was wondering, do you have some sort of form where you kind of bring them together  
**[0:55:36-0:55:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:36):**  or you have some sort of community that is basically working and getting to know each  
**[0:55:42-0:55:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:42):**  other and communicating?  
**[0:55:43-0:55:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:43):**  Because these are the people that have to tell all the other people what they are doing  
**[0:55:48-0:55:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:48):**  and why they are doing it and how much fun it is.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:50):**  I mean, this is such a huge potential to basically make this thinking, this knowledge, this form  
**[0:55:59-0:56:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:55:59):**  of investing known to other people and through this sort of bottom up experience, you know,  
**[0:56:05-0:56:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:05):**  sort of, yeah, I mean, initiate some sort of pressure towards political thinking and  
**[0:56:11-0:56:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:11):**  so forth.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:12):**  So is that something that you utilize at all?  
**[0:56:13-0:56:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:13):**  Well, we try really hard and we're still open to and when we're exploring different avenues,  
**[0:56:19-0:56:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:19):**  but I think the biggest potential here is always regional.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:22):**  So the farms, you know, we support the farms in doing events or panel discussions or one  
**[0:56:30-0:56:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:30):**  of us goes there or we also invite other people to give a talk and then we create an event  
**[0:56:35-0:56:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:35):**  and then the community around the farm, they come and they listen.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:38):**  This is how we engage local communities.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:41):**  But in terms of the larger community, all of the 700 plus members that we have, it's  
**[0:56:46-0:56:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:46):**  really hard to bring all of them together.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:48):**  And I would say we as a national organization, we are not where most people feel the strongest  
**[0:56:53-0:56:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:53):**  emotional bonds.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:54):**  So the emotional bond usually happens on a regional level.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:56:58):**  And this is something that we really aim for as we grow in the number of farms.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:02):**  Now we're 20 farms and I think as we grow to maybe 100 farms and then maybe 1,000 farms,  
**[0:57:07-0:57:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:07):**  then as we have a certain number of farms, let's say at least five farms in a certain  
**[0:57:11-0:57:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:11):**  region, then you can create regional structures where then it's possible for people to really  
**[0:57:17-0:57:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:17):**  come together because it's just, you know, Germany is still a fairly large country, obviously  
**[0:57:23-0:57:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:23):**  not compared to geographically compared to the US, it's still small, but still it's a  
**[0:57:28-0:57:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:28):**  huge effort to come together.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:32):**  Let's say, you know, we invite them to attend some event, then some of them would have to  
**[0:57:38-0:57:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:38):**  travel.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:39):**  And there's also the local laws, like the regional laws and the local politicians you  
**[0:57:42-0:57:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:42):**  want to really engage and understand and take action, which is much easier if they can easily  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:49):**  visit one of the farms, they can see if they can touch, maybe even can participate and  
**[0:57:54-0:57:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:54):**  invest themselves personally and you get a whole different dynamic and discussion.  
**[0:57:58-0:57:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:57:59):**  And this is something we still need to figure out how we can utilize the community best  
**[0:58:04-0:58:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:04):**  in that way.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:06):**  So we provide them obviously with information, we provide them with flyers and we have a  
**[0:58:12-0:58:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:12):**  handbook that describes us as an organization, as a community, and we have a nice website,  
**[0:58:20-0:58:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:20):**  we have nice videos, but still, I think there is a lot of room for potential to utilize  
**[0:58:27-0:58:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:27):**  that potential.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:28):**  And just to get it out a bit of the German context specifically and to end with a few  
**[0:58:33-0:58:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:33):**  questions because I know and I don't know the details about it, but you do.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:37):**  For anybody that's not listening, that's listening, let's say in the rest of Europe, that's not  
**[0:58:41-0:58:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:41):**  listening in Germany, how easy is it because you're talking about some cases, very small  
**[0:58:47-0:58:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:47):**  investments and some cases quite a lot larger, 600,000, 700,000, etc.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:51):**  But always the term of the transaction costs are always an issue, small tickets, it's difficult  
**[0:58:57-0:58:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:57):**  to put 50k to work.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:58:58):**  For many people it's difficult to understand, like it's much easier to put 5 million or  
**[0:59:01-0:59:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:01):**  even 50 million to work because the cost of doing the diligence and doing the whole process  
**[0:59:05-0:59:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:05):**  and prospectus and everything, it just makes more sense on larger numbers.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:10):**  But you mentioned that in Europe or in the EU, there's actually some interesting things  
**[0:59:16-0:59:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:16):**  that have changed the last few years, not many people are knowing about it and you're  
**[0:59:19-0:59:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:19):**  actually using that to make a lot of these concepts flow.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:24):**  Can you describe a bit what has changed, I think 2017 or 18, and what makes that possible  
**[0:59:29-0:59:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:29):**  for anybody that's actually in Europe that is thinking, wow, I should do this in Portugal  
**[0:59:33-0:59:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:33):**  or I should do this in Spain or Italy, Greece, etc.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:37):**  I'm glad you mentioned that.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:38):**  So yeah, there have been significant changes that I think went mostly under the radar for  
**[0:59:44-0:59:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:44):**  most people.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:45):**  So one of the big issues was that after some shady investments were offered in the past,  
**[0:59:52-0:59:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:52):**  the new regulations were put in place that required any investment offering over 100,000  
**[0:59:58-1:00:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=0:59:58):**  euros to issue a prospectus.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:00):**  And for those who don't know what that is, it's basically a very thick legal document  
**[1:00:05-1:00:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:05):**  that costs between 30 and 50,000 euros in lawyer costs to make.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:11):**  And so if you're raising 100,000 euros and you have to spend at least 30,000 to raise  
**[1:00:15-1:00:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:15):**  that money, that's just, it doesn't make it just legal.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:17):**  Just legal costs.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:18):**  Imagine the cost of the raising the platform.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:21):**  It doesn't really make sense at all.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:23):**  And so they realized that they made a mistake there to be honest.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:26):**  And so in 2017, they revised this law and they said that up to a million euros, you  
**[1:00:32-1:00:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:32):**  don't need to issue as prospectus anymore.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:34):**  Each country has to kind of create its own regulation as to what they require, but it  
**[1:00:40-1:00:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:40):**  should be simple.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:41):**  Basically, that's what the EU law said.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:43):**  And up to 8 million, each country is free to choose whether they want to stipulate the  
**[1:00:48-1:00:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:48):**  prospectus requirement or have their own local law.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:52):**  And is that whatever regulations they put in place, it still has to enable the free  
**[1:00:56-1:00:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:56):**  flow of capital between EU countries.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:00:59):**  So Germany opted for no prospectus requirement, up to 8 million in investments.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:07):**  And last year they made this new law where they stipulated the criteria, what is now  
**[1:01:14-1:01:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:14):**  required.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:15):**  And this is a very simple pamphlet, which is allowed to be maximum of three pages.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:20):**  And it just has to have the information on your balance sheet and your past year's performance  
**[1:01:26-1:01:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:26):**  and a legal disclaimer where it says, look, this is a private offering and it's a high  
**[1:01:31-1:01:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:31):**  risk investment and you could lose all of your investment.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:35):**  And that's basically it.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:36):**  You send that to the financial regulatory office and they have to give you the go or  
**[1:01:42-1:01:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:42):**  no go within 10 days.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:44):**  And then you are free to raise up to 8 million for every single investment.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:49):**  So this is especially important for us raising money through shares.  
**[1:01:56-1:01:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:56):**  This has been exempt already before.  
**[1:01:58-1:02:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:01:58):**  So for us, it wasn't really an issue.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:00):**  But for farms to raise capital to invest in stables from the community, this was a huge  
**[1:02:05-1:02:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:05):**  issue because they couldn't raise more than 100,000.  
**[1:02:08-1:02:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:08):**  And now there was a legal gray area.  
**[1:02:11-1:02:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:11):**  We had an agreement with the financial regulatory authorities where we kind of used a loophole.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:17):**  But basically now there's no more headaches in terms of the legal framework.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:24):**  And now any farm can raise up to 8 million through community capital.  
**[1:02:29-1:02:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:29):**  And we have the IT infrastructure available where this is very easily possible.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:34):**  You have your, if you're part of the Kulturland community, you have your own website and then  
**[1:02:38-1:02:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:38):**  people can go there.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:39):**  They can choose to invest in whatever you want to offer.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:44):**  And this could be all over Europe.  
**[1:02:46-1:02:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:46):**  You're saying this might be slightly different in different countries because Germany chose  
**[1:02:50-1:02:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:50):**  the 8 million and chose the pamphlet, but it has to be a simple process in every different  
**[1:02:55-1:02:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:55):**  country when you're raising more than 100.  
**[1:02:57-1:03:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:02:57):**  That's very, very interesting and friendly.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:00):**  Exactly.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:01):**  And so this is possible all over Europe and the IT that we built, it's something we built  
**[1:03:06-1:03:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:06):**  and want to make available for any eco-social projects.  
**[1:03:10-1:03:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:10):**  So we keep it.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:11):**  So get in touch when you want to do this.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:13):**  We're still developing it and I would say maybe in a year's time, the software is available  
**[1:03:17-1:03:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:17):**  for anyone to use.  
**[1:03:19-1:03:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:19):**  But yeah, get in touch if you want to use it and then we'll work, you know, we'll talk  
**[1:03:23-1:03:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:23):**  with you and see when we can make that happen.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:26):**  And we're happy to make that available to anyone.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:29):**  Super.  
**[1:03:30-1:03:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:30):**  And just to bring this conversation home, Benedict, I mean, this has been a long series  
**[1:03:34-1:03:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:34):**  where we're at the end, actually, we're going to do another episode where we look back,  
**[1:03:38-1:03:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:38):**  but at this episode of The Crowd and super practical because we're talking Germany, you're  
**[1:03:43-1:03:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:43):**  based in Germany.  
**[1:03:44-1:03:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:44):**  And what brings this to mind, or if you have in a few sentences, what's your feedback?  
**[1:03:51-1:03:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:51):**  What are your ideas going through your head right now at the end of this episode with  
**[1:03:55-1:03:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:55):**  Thomas?  
**[1:03:56-1:03:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:56):**  And then I will ask Thomas to say a few things.  
**[1:03:57-1:04:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:03:57):**  Well, I mean, there's so many things.  
**[1:04:00-1:04:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:00):**  One I think that is always so dominant when you hear of initiatives like this.  
**[1:04:07-1:04:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:07):**  And I mean, there's so many of which we all don't know of, right.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:10):**  And it's incredible what people already do in that regard.  
**[1:04:14-1:04:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:14):**  But you always think, why is not everyone talking about this?  
**[1:04:18-1:04:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:18):**  Why is not politics saying, oh, my God, we have found an amazing solution that does so  
**[1:04:23-1:04:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:23):**  much good and it has so much potential.  
**[1:04:26-1:04:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:26):**  This is always one thing that goes through my mind.  
**[1:04:28-1:04:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:28):**  And I mean, with regard to Thomas and I guess his team, I'm just deeply impressed by, you  
**[1:04:33-1:04:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:33):**  know, the whole thought process they have actually gone through.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:37):**  And that is something that has so much detail and it goes down to so many different aspects  
**[1:04:42-1:04:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:42):**  you have to keep in mind and you have to think through and you have to communicate on a short  
**[1:04:47-1:04:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:47):**  term but also on a long term period.  
**[1:04:49-1:04:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:49):**  And I think it's incredible what kind of not only thought process they have developed,  
**[1:04:56-1:05:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:04:56):**  but also the kind of decisions that they took and quite, I guess there was a lot of discussions  
**[1:05:01-1:05:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:01):**  around them.  
**[1:05:02-1:05:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:02):**  But this is so, this sounds very holistic if you ask me.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:05):**  And I'm just really grateful that Thomas and his team have done this and are going through  
**[1:05:12-1:05:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:12):**  this.  
**[1:05:13-1:05:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:13):**  And I think this has enormous potential.  
**[1:05:14-1:05:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:14):**  I'm already looking forward to, you know, a couple of years time, we'll be like, you  
**[1:05:19-1:05:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:19):**  guys need to meet.  
**[1:05:20-1:05:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:20):**  Yeah.  
**[1:05:21-1:05:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:21):**  I spoke to Thomas back in the day when they only had like, I don't know, when he was still  
**[1:05:23-1:05:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:23):**  accessible, 8 million on the balance sheet.  
**[1:05:27-1:05:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:27):**  So, you know, I think it's, there's going to be amazing times to come and Thomas and  
**[1:05:32-1:05:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:32):**  that kind of thinking and those kinds of ways are going to have an incredible influence  
**[1:05:38-1:05:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:38):**  on this.  
**[1:05:39-1:05:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:39):**  So, I think it's our task of all of us to basically make sure that this information  
**[1:05:44-1:05:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:44):**  gets out and is being pushed and that we connect collectively, basically see that, you know,  
**[1:05:50-1:05:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:50):**  we can, we can grow this movement.  
**[1:05:52-1:05:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:52):**  Yeah.  
**[1:05:53-1:05:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:53):**  So, good stuff, Thomas.  
**[1:05:54-1:05:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:54):**  Thank you so much for being on the show.  
**[1:05:57-1:05:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:57):**  Thank you.  
**[1:05:58-1:06:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:05:58):**  Any final words, Thomas, on this episode?  
**[1:06:00-1:06:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:00):**  Well, I think what I didn't say at all this time is really my motivation to do all of  
**[1:06:08-1:06:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:08):**  this.  
**[1:06:09-1:06:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:09):**  And, you know, we're talking about a lot of numbers and that's just because this is the  
**[1:06:12-1:06:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:12):**  world we live in.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:13):**  You know, we live in a world of numbers and metrics and regulations and this is, you know,  
**[1:06:20-1:06:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:20):**  the things we have to deal with to make things work.  
**[1:06:22-1:06:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:22):**  But, you know, this really comes from a very deep place, our motivation.  
**[1:06:26-1:06:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:26):**  And, you know, I studied economics and I was very disillusioned with the kind of picture  
**[1:06:34-1:06:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:34):**  of humanity that is portrayed there.  
**[1:06:37-1:06:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:37):**  You know, this homo economic, the selfish human that is just working in self-interest.  
**[1:06:41-1:06:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:41):**  I never believed that, you know, and when I got to know the comments, you know, Elinor  
**[1:06:46-1:06:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:46):**  Ostrom, how she's just, you know, showing us that there is another way of working together.  
**[1:06:53-1:06:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:53):**  You know, there's a way to, you know, and it really works.  
**[1:06:58-1:07:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:06:58):**  It has worked for hundreds of years, even thousands of years where communities have  
**[1:07:02-1:07:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:07:02):**  managed their own resources.  
**[1:07:04-1:07:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:07:04):**  And so this is really a guiding star and to really enable young people and also, of course,  
**[1:07:12-1:07:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep8#t=1:07:12):**  old people who are young at heart, who are connected really deeply in their hearts and

**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative  food and agriculture, follow our video course via investing in regenerative  agriculture.com slash course, or in the links below now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:13):**  You will listen to an episode about why a 250 million agriculture land  investor has recently done her first regenerative ag deal and how they are  providing growth finance for successful farmers by aligning themselves with the  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:27):**  farmer. Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture,  investing as if the planet mattered podcast show where I talk to the  pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space to learn more on how  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:41):**  to put our money to work, to regenerate soil, people, local communities, and  ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return. Why am I focused on  soil and regeneration? Because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:54):**  have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying  much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet. In March,  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:01:08):**  last year, we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to  support our work.

**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:01:31):**  Thank you. Today I interviewed Joelle Faulkner, founder of area one farms,  area one farms builds equity partnerships across Canada that enable  farm operators to expand without the burden of fees, rent or interest  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:01:43):**  payments. Over the last seven years, they've invested over 250 million in 18  different properties across Canada, and recently made their first regenerative  sustainable deal. Of course, I'm going to ask everything about that. And if  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:01:55):**  they're planning to do more in the future. Welcome, Joelle.  Thanks so much for having me.  Could you tell us a bit why you're in this space? I always like to ask this  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:04):**  personal question at the beginning, because most people I interview could do  many other things in their lives and they decide to focus on soil and  agriculture.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:11):**  So I run a company called area one farms. We do equity investments with family  farms in Canada to expand their land base and infrastructure. And we ended up  interested in regenerative farming as a risk reduction method. So when we look  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:30):**  at kind of where agriculture is moving, we think consumer preferences are  actually going to drive a lot of change even ahead of regulation. And one of the  consumer preferences is looks like it is likely to be for lower inputs. And we  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:46):**  have not been able to find a way to do organic well, because of the risks with  erosion, especially in the areas that we're farming in, which are relatively  dry. And that got us interested in regenerative techniques.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:01):**  And actually, to take it one step further backwards, what got you interested in  agriculture to begin with?  I'm from a dairy farm in London, Ontario. And so I've been in agriculture and got  
**[0:03:13-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:13):**  interested in how we could finance growth differently than the land  investment firms that operated at that point in Canada, which bought land and  rented it out. So we thought there was a more model that could be more  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:27):**  financially sustainable for farmers, where they could be owners instead of  leasers.  And if you look at the deals you've done so far, I mean, we can look at the last  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:36):**  one, which was on regenerative and sustainable, but I think it's more or  less the same model as the others. Can you explain us a bit the model that you  operate and why is it so different than the buy to rent basically that you  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:47):**  mentioned before?  So we partner, so the farmer puts in equity and we put in equity. So they're  a co-owner from the beginning. But the second thing that happens is there's no  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:57):**  lease payments. So there's no rent payments, or land costs to the  enterprise, so to that joint venture. And instead of the farmer taking a salary,  they take 15% of income and of appreciation on the full farm, not just  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:13):**  their ownership part. So they own whatever portion they own, they get 100%  of the return from that, but on all of the land that they don't own or didn't  put in the equity for, they get 15% of both income and appreciation.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:26):**  And if you look at a standard case you've worked with, usually it's a family  farm that wants to buy a neighbour, a neighbouring property or some land, or  actually quite a bit of land nearby. And instead of you buying it for them and  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:39):**  leasing it back to them, you basically set up a separate entity, a joint venture  where the farmer joins with 10%, 15% or 20% and you bring in the rest, if I  understand correctly.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:49):**  That's exactly right. And so we do that. Generally, we're buying out landlords  for existing farms, so they're already renting and they want to move to an  equity base. Or we're expanding because multiple kids want to farm until the  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:04):**  farm needs to grow.  And then what's the longer term vision or future for the farmers? Are they  buying out your 80% or whatever the number is of the joint venture over time?  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:14):**  And do they have the financial space to do that? Is that the 10 year goal or the  20 year goal? What's the goal for the farmer?  It ends up being a 20 year goal usually to buy us out. So they end up usually  
**[0:05:24-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:24):**  being able to buy out 30 to 50% of the farm at year 10. And then another 30  around year 15 and another 30 are finishing kind of around year 20.  And how has been the, because it's a very different relationship, obviously,  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:40):**  than a normal farm land invest or investments, you really partner with the  farmer. How has been that relationship?  That's been great. I think it helps a lot that I have an agricultural  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:50):**  background. And so the whole culture of our firm understands farming and  farmers and good years and bad years. It's also been really valuable that we  found great partners to work with, who bring us really interesting  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:04):**  opportunities. So in addition to being invested in the land itself, we also end  up investing in the associated businesses. So how can we improve the  land for productivity and profitability? And also, are there like seed cleaning  
**[0:06:19-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:19):**  or conversion work, so kind of bringing pasture into productive or irrigation  work. And so all of that plays in.  And how has been the response from investors? Because I'm imagining you're  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:33):**  not putting all of the money yourself, you're working with investors. How has  been a response to this different method when looking at just buying and renting  it out?  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:42):**  From the investors side, it's been really interesting. We have proven out over the  period so far, that this is a higher value model than renting, which has  brought us a number of investors. And a number of our investors generally are  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:01):**  very long term in their thinking and believe in the value of partnership at  the outset. So we don't get everybody because their lease-back models are  certainly easier to manage. And some investors are more interested in that  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:14):**  and the ability to kind of sell easier, etc. But when we do find investors, we  find that they're very interested in what we're doing and really excited to  be part of it. And what are the return targets more or less that you are  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:29):**  looking at over the 10 or 20 year period? So we aim for a total return of around  12% for investors. It's such a high number. But if you think of where that  comes from, Canada's average appreciation over 60 years has been 7%. We do a lot  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:47):**  of improvement work to the land itself. And so only a minority, very small  portion of that is actually coming from production on an annual basis.  And now looking at the regenerative part, the last deal you did, has that been  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:03):**  different than the other deals you've done? And if so, in what sense?  Nope, it's exactly the same as the other deals we've done. And it's just a  different method of farming and we think a more profitable one.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:14):**  And what kind of operation is it? Or what kind of operation will it be? Once  they are maybe integrating more things? What do we have to imagine when we hear  the first regenerative sustainable deal by area one farms?  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:27):**  Oh, in our case, it's the farmer isn't changing anything about how they  operate. They just happen to be using those methods in how they operate  already. And so they run a mixed farm, integrated cow calf and crop production.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:41):**  And we are partners on the crop production side, but with an arrangement  around kind of how we make land available for their cow calf operation  in addition. And our numbers, when we look at their history and their  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:55):**  projections, our numbers are based on them having used their sustainable  farming practices and continuing to do so over time.  And you mentioned that you imagine they will be more profitable. Does that  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:08):**  mean you're you're actively looking for others as well? Because I can  imagine for your investors, that might be a plus compared to, let's say,  conventional chemical agriculture.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:17):**  We are actively looking for others, but our interest is working with great  farmers in the way that they already work. So we don't have people where we  come in one way and we say you have to switch to another farming method. We  
**[0:09:32-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:32):**  think that's a poor way to find partners and to work with partners. And so  we're very interested in regenerative agricultural partners and we'll look  into them kind of as they approach us.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:48):**  What do you see as the biggest barriers for regenerative agriculture to really  scale?  So I think when we've looked at it, because we've looked at it with some of  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:57):**  our conventional guys, I actually think the hard thing about scaling regenerative  scaling regenerative agriculture is two parts. One is the integration of  animals means you either need to be running a mixed farm or you need to be  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:10:11):**  near an animal production facility that needs manure disposal. So that's one  piece. And the other piece is, I actually think a lot of it is that farmers who  are really good at operating in a certain way would need a recipe card that  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:10:30):**  said instead of this activity, we are doing this activity. Because what's  really hard about it is to figure out a whole new structure of how to like  activity sets. And I actually think making it as simple as that as a  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:10:46):**  starting place and then testing on some parts of the land versus others.  Because we think that in a lot of cases it's risk reduction as much as anything  else. So it will do better in worse years. That also means that you have to  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:01):**  be trying it in a worse year so that you can see the difference.  Yeah, I see a lot of people coming towards it from the risk perspective and  the cost perspective.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:09):**  Yeah, exactly.  Which obviously makes a lot of sense, especially in the bad years when your  neighbor is suffering probably much more. Well, in a good year, everybody's  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:18):**  doing great. And some people are doing amazing, but you don't see that  different too much, especially in sales prices.  Yeah, definitely agree.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:26):**  And so what do you see, let's say in the near future for you as an investor in  regenerative agriculture? What do you need? What do you look for? What are you  excited about? Let's say we took a year from now. What are the main things  
**[0:11:39-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:39):**  you're working on?  We're really interested in finding additional partners in space because we  learn with and from our partners. And then we also are very interested in  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:52):**  kind of the cost part of this. So seeing productivity with lower costs and how  that can work.  And if you could change one thing in the agriculture sector, if you can wave a  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:03):**  magic wand and then tomorrow morning we'll wake up and something has changed,  what would that be?  It's a great question. I don't know. Like right now, it's really hard to say  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:14):**  that it wouldn't be trade wars where we're at.  Which is a fair answer.  Yeah, with commodities. But I think that's probably a little bit on the timely  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:25):**  side, more than maybe long-term. In our case, changing the investor side would  probably have the biggest immediate impact to us. And I think the disconnect  there, and it's probably similar actually to have some of the sustainable  
**[0:12:41-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:41):**  agricultural producers, the issues that they face or farmers face in general,  actually think that the finance sector generally under appreciates how many  risks farmers are managing for at any given time. And as a result, under  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:59):**  appreciates the value that they bring. And so what we think is really valuable  about our model is the ability to keep communities strong and improve those  communities by keeping wealth within the communities because of the  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:13:15):**  appreciation shared with the farm partners. But that comes from, it's much  more like thinking of farmers as tech entrepreneurs than it is of thinking of  farmers like manufacturing people in manufacturing plants. And I think that  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:13:32):**  comes from the respect that I have because I grew up farming and so  understand the many risks and what people are managing for. But what's  interesting to us on our investor side is that's usually kind of unique. I  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:13:49):**  think for us, I'd like to see us get a bit closer to consumers. So we haven't  experimented with whether we can create brands, but I do think that's a really  interesting opportunity right now and one that has some potential for  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:06):**  participation over time. I guess the magic wand that I'd want to wave from a  producer perspective is like if you could have a magic light that showed you  if a salesperson for any given thing or the data that you read, if it would work  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:24):**  for you on your place in the way that it's described. And so what I think that  that is, so many people come to each farm every year to try and sell something  that is going to make productivity or the profitability higher. And it's true  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:39):**  that something must do that, but it's also true that not everything that comes  to the door can do that. And so it's very hard to discern what will work and if  you could pick a magic wand it would be being able to tell which of the  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:53):**  innovations in all contexts would work. What we see in sustainable agriculture  and Canada does have significant research around sustainable agriculture,  so a lot learned from that research, is the methods that work elsewhere because  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:07):**  of the climactic differences don't always work for us and need innovation  around them to work for us. But I think like if you knew going in what  your best shot at working was, it would sure make life simpler. I think it's an  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:23):**  excellent answer. I mean there's so much noise in this space and so much  information and people coming to sell XYZ to farmers daily, but at the same  time they all have unique circumstances and they only, I mean they run one  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:39):**  slash one and a half season a year, which means maybe 40-50 in their lifetime,  which means they're risking a lot if they are trying one thing and not the  other. And by definition most of the things don't work, which means they  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:51):**  probably choose something that doesn't work. So it's a huge risk and I think  many people forget that, how much they're gambling, plus all the weather risks that  only increase, plus all the consumers that constantly change, plus the trade  
**[0:16:01-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:01):**  wars you mentioned before. It's a 6% or 10% or from a very, I mean  obviously a regenerative farm, it's probably worth a lot more than a 10%  from somewhere else because of all the side benefits actually they create  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:15):**  locally and both environmentally and socially. And to end with a question,  I mean obviously not investment advice, but if you would imagine there's an  audience of smart impact investors, or at least they consider themselves smart,  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:29):**  that are enthusiastic about land, enthusiastic about soil, very  enthusiastic about farmers, they know the risk and they would like to get into  the space, they haven't invested yet. What would you advise them to read, what  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:39):**  would you advise them to do to understand more and maybe make their  first investment in the regenerative food and agriculture space?  So our bias, because it's what I understand and as a result what we're invested in  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:54):**  and our investors are invested in, is the land base. Meaning there are a lot of  places along the regenerative agriculture value chain that you could  invest, and in our case we invest in the land. And then from there we grow out any  
**[0:17:10-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:17:10):**  associated businesses. If other investors came with other expertise that they came  with, brand views or consumer packaged goods, they would probably have a  different place in that value chain that would make a lot of sense for them. But  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:17:27):**  what they can say is, from our standpoint, it's a really low risk investment. So it  is a moderate return with low risk, which makes it a high risk adjusted return  investment for the land base itself. And I think that's probably especially  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:17:45):**  true as you get into regenerative agriculture, where you are minimizing  more risk. And so I guess that's part one. The second is, we don't go into areas  without a partner. And we think that that creates considerable value both for us  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:00):**  and for the partners and for the communities. I think if somebody's  looking at sustainability, both to be mindful that sustainability should  probably also include financial sustainability and social sustainability  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:16):**  in addition to environmental. And I guess the final point on that is, if you have  an opportunity to invest in land and to do it locally with a partner, we do think  that that is a better investment over the long term for everyone involved.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:34):**  I mean, I always say final question, then I have a few more. Just on the  meat that we didn't talk about, when you do a deal, are you doing them on a  deal-by-deal basis in a sense? Are you connecting an investor, basically  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:46):**  one-on-one or investors one-on-one to a property? Or is it a fund like structure?  How is it structured for the investor side of things? Yeah, we have a  fund like structure. We used to do it on a property basis. So you'd come into  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:00):**  Farm A or Farm B or Farm C. And it doesn't give the investor the  diversification that we think is really valuable. And so we now do it on a pool  fund structure that fund makes co-investments with various farmers.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:12):**  And that's how we build out over time. It has proven to be more valuable for the  investors. And it has proven to be more valuable to the farms, to some extent,  because any investor is less dependent on the performance of the specific asset.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:32):**  Which gives us a bit more of an ability to take a portfolio view, but also gives  gives, I think, the right understanding to both the investors and the farmers.  To the farmer it is their farm that they're invested in. And to the investors  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:48):**  they are invested in many farms. And is it a closed-end fund or a continuous  evergreen? Because you mentioned 20 years, which is quite a long period. How do you  manage bringing new farms basically into the fund and new investors? We have  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:03):**  closed-ended funds. Our newest fund is actually a perpetual entity with  guaranteed liquidity. So it operates more like a long-term or evergreen. It isn't  open-ended, meaning we don't add capital to it. After we fully invest all of the  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:21):**  capital and the investors then know what investments they have, we have the  auction, or the investors have the option, of reopening that fund. And  otherwise we raise a subsequent fund. Okay, and now I promised the last  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:36):**  question, unless we open a lot more other questions. What do you believe? I'd like  to ask this question. It comes from John Kempf, who I interviewed before. What do  you believe to be true about, he says modern agriculture. I'd like to ask about  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:48):**  regenerative agriculture as well, but let's go with agriculture in general.  What do you believe to be true about agriculture that others don't believe to  be true? It depends who your others are, but if it's a financial community,  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:59):**  generally speaking, and we hear this on panels when we ask our existing  investors, and even really sophisticated institutional investors, farmers are  smarter than you think. And that's because they have to be. They manage a  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:21:14):**  lot of variables, they do it fairly systematically or to the best of their  ability, generally looking for advice and opportunity. And so we think that all  primary producers are managing a lot of complex things and as a result are  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:21:31):**  actually running much more sophisticated businesses. I think that farmers often  present to the world and subsequently different and more sophisticated than  financial people often expect. So an advice could be find a farmer and or a  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:21:50):**  farmer family and spend some good quality time together to understand the  complexity that not only the climate puts to them, but also we as consumers  and finance people are basically from a distance putting at them and they have to.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:22:04):**  I don't even know that you have to spend a lot of time. Like if you think  through all of the variables that are getting managed and the quantity of  capital that they've built over time, I think it becomes relatively  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:22:17):**  straightforward. I want to thank you so much for your time this morning and  definitely be checking in on the more regenerative deals you probably are  gonna make in the future. And I'd be great. And thank you so much for sharing.

**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:23:29):**  video course investing in regenerative agriculture and food. How to put money to  work in regenerating soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing  it. Why are we doing this course after 100 interviews and more than 100 hours  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:23:41):**  of audio asking the question how to put money to work in regenerating soils, and  I've been following the space since 2011. And recording these podcasts since 2016.  We thought it was time to share our lessons learned. What have we seen in the  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:23:54):**  space over the last years? How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast? How have we picked interviewees? And what  questions should you ask? What is happening in the space? What should you  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:24:06):**  read? What should you listen? What should you watch? How to approach this space?  For whom is this course? You, the soil builders and investors in the space. The  soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:24:20):**  managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech  companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic  management consultants, etc etc. People that are building soil at scale. And the  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:24:33):**  investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals, or people who are putting other people's money to work  through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:24:45):**  Is this course free? No. This is pay what you think it's worth. Meaning I have no  way of knowing what this course will be worth to you. And I'm very aware that  among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:24:59):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have  the means to consider paying what you think it's worth. Thank you. So what is  this course? It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:25:14):**  minutes, plus PDF slides, so you don't have to ride along. We're gonna look into  why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture is so  risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:25:28):**  build what to invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind  of investors you could find if you're a soil builder. Every lesson will have a  digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what kind of  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:25:40):**  interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more. So what  is it not? It's not a list of investable deals. Unfortunately, that doesn't exist  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:25:53):**  in this world. We're really at the beginning of the regenerative  agriculture and food revolution. It's also not investment advice. Before  making any investment, please find professional investment advice. So get  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:26:05):**  ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on the  link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

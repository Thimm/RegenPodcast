**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:18):**  investor has recently done her first regenerative ag deal and how they are  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:23):**  providing growth finance for successful farmers by aligning themselves with the  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:27):**  farmer. Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:00:34-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:34):**  investing as if the planet mattered podcast show where I talk to the  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:37):**  pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space to learn more on how  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:41):**  to put our money to work, to regenerate soil, people, local communities, and  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:46):**  ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return. Why am I focused on  
**[0:00:51-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:51):**  soil and regeneration? Because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:54):**  have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:00:58):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:01:03):**  much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet. In March,

**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:01:31):**  Thank you. Today I interviewed Joelle Faulkner, founder of area one farms,  
**[0:01:37-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:01:37):**  area one farms builds equity partnerships across Canada that enable  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:01:40):**  farm operators to expand without the burden of fees, rent or interest  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:01:43):**  payments. Over the last seven years, they've invested over 250 million in 18  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:01:48):**  different properties across Canada, and recently made their first regenerative  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:01:52):**  sustainable deal. Of course, I'm going to ask everything about that. And if  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:01:55):**  they're planning to do more in the future. Welcome, Joelle.  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:01:58):**  Thanks so much for having me.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:00):**  Could you tell us a bit why you're in this space? I always like to ask this  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:04):**  personal question at the beginning, because most people I interview could do  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:07):**  many other things in their lives and they decide to focus on soil and  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:10):**  agriculture.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:11):**  So I run a company called area one farms. We do equity investments with family  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:18):**  farms in Canada to expand their land base and infrastructure. And we ended up  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:25):**  interested in regenerative farming as a risk reduction method. So when we look  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:30):**  at kind of where agriculture is moving, we think consumer preferences are  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:34):**  actually going to drive a lot of change even ahead of regulation. And one of the  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:40):**  consumer preferences is looks like it is likely to be for lower inputs. And we  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:46):**  have not been able to find a way to do organic well, because of the risks with  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:53):**  erosion, especially in the areas that we're farming in, which are relatively  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:02:57):**  dry. And that got us interested in regenerative techniques.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:01):**  And actually, to take it one step further backwards, what got you interested in  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:06):**  agriculture to begin with?  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:07):**  I'm from a dairy farm in London, Ontario. And so I've been in agriculture and got  
**[0:03:13-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:13):**  interested in how we could finance growth differently than the land  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:20):**  investment firms that operated at that point in Canada, which bought land and  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:24):**  rented it out. So we thought there was a more model that could be more  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:27):**  financially sustainable for farmers, where they could be owners instead of  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:32):**  leasers.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:33):**  And if you look at the deals you've done so far, I mean, we can look at the last  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:36):**  one, which was on regenerative and sustainable, but I think it's more or  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:38):**  less the same model as the others. Can you explain us a bit the model that you  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:43):**  operate and why is it so different than the buy to rent basically that you  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:47):**  mentioned before?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:49):**  So we partner, so the farmer puts in equity and we put in equity. So they're  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:53):**  a co-owner from the beginning. But the second thing that happens is there's no  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:03:57):**  lease payments. So there's no rent payments, or land costs to the  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:02):**  enterprise, so to that joint venture. And instead of the farmer taking a salary,  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:07):**  they take 15% of income and of appreciation on the full farm, not just  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:13):**  their ownership part. So they own whatever portion they own, they get 100%  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:18):**  of the return from that, but on all of the land that they don't own or didn't  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:22):**  put in the equity for, they get 15% of both income and appreciation.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:26):**  And if you look at a standard case you've worked with, usually it's a family  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:30):**  farm that wants to buy a neighbour, a neighbouring property or some land, or  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:35):**  actually quite a bit of land nearby. And instead of you buying it for them and  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:39):**  leasing it back to them, you basically set up a separate entity, a joint venture  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:43):**  where the farmer joins with 10%, 15% or 20% and you bring in the rest, if I  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:48):**  understand correctly.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:49):**  That's exactly right. And so we do that. Generally, we're buying out landlords  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:54):**  for existing farms, so they're already renting and they want to move to an  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:04:58):**  equity base. Or we're expanding because multiple kids want to farm until the  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:04):**  farm needs to grow.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:05):**  And then what's the longer term vision or future for the farmers? Are they  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:09):**  buying out your 80% or whatever the number is of the joint venture over time?  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:14):**  And do they have the financial space to do that? Is that the 10 year goal or the  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:17):**  20 year goal? What's the goal for the farmer?  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:20):**  It ends up being a 20 year goal usually to buy us out. So they end up usually  
**[0:05:24-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:24):**  being able to buy out 30 to 50% of the farm at year 10. And then another 30  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:31):**  around year 15 and another 30 are finishing kind of around year 20.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:37):**  And how has been the, because it's a very different relationship, obviously,  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:40):**  than a normal farm land invest or investments, you really partner with the  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:45):**  farmer. How has been that relationship?  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:47):**  That's been great. I think it helps a lot that I have an agricultural  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:50):**  background. And so the whole culture of our firm understands farming and  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:05:55):**  farmers and good years and bad years. It's also been really valuable that we  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:00):**  found great partners to work with, who bring us really interesting  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:04):**  opportunities. So in addition to being invested in the land itself, we also end  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:08):**  up investing in the associated businesses. So how can we improve the  
**[0:06:11-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:11):**  land for productivity and profitability? And also, are there like seed cleaning  
**[0:06:19-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:19):**  or conversion work, so kind of bringing pasture into productive or irrigation  
**[0:06:27-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:27):**  work. And so all of that plays in.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:29):**  And how has been the response from investors? Because I'm imagining you're  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:33):**  not putting all of the money yourself, you're working with investors. How has  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:37):**  been a response to this different method when looking at just buying and renting  
**[0:06:41-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:41):**  it out?  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:42):**  From the investors side, it's been really interesting. We have proven out over the  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:48):**  period so far, that this is a higher value model than renting, which has  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:06:54):**  brought us a number of investors. And a number of our investors generally are  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:01):**  very long term in their thinking and believe in the value of partnership at  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:05):**  the outset. So we don't get everybody because their lease-back models are  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:10):**  certainly easier to manage. And some investors are more interested in that  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:14):**  and the ability to kind of sell easier, etc. But when we do find investors, we  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:18):**  find that they're very interested in what we're doing and really excited to  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:22):**  be part of it. And what are the return targets more or less that you are  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:29):**  looking at over the 10 or 20 year period? So we aim for a total return of around  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:35):**  12% for investors. It's such a high number. But if you think of where that  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:40):**  comes from, Canada's average appreciation over 60 years has been 7%. We do a lot  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:47):**  of improvement work to the land itself. And so only a minority, very small  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:53):**  portion of that is actually coming from production on an annual basis.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:07:56):**  And now looking at the regenerative part, the last deal you did, has that been  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:03):**  different than the other deals you've done? And if so, in what sense?  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:06):**  Nope, it's exactly the same as the other deals we've done. And it's just a  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:11):**  different method of farming and we think a more profitable one.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:14):**  And what kind of operation is it? Or what kind of operation will it be? Once  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:19):**  they are maybe integrating more things? What do we have to imagine when we hear  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:23):**  the first regenerative sustainable deal by area one farms?  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:27):**  Oh, in our case, it's the farmer isn't changing anything about how they  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:31):**  operate. They just happen to be using those methods in how they operate  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:35):**  already. And so they run a mixed farm, integrated cow calf and crop production.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:41):**  And we are partners on the crop production side, but with an arrangement  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:46):**  around kind of how we make land available for their cow calf operation  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:50):**  in addition. And our numbers, when we look at their history and their  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:08:55):**  projections, our numbers are based on them having used their sustainable  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:00):**  farming practices and continuing to do so over time.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:04):**  And you mentioned that you imagine they will be more profitable. Does that  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:08):**  mean you're you're actively looking for others as well? Because I can  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:12):**  imagine for your investors, that might be a plus compared to, let's say,  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:15):**  conventional chemical agriculture.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:17):**  We are actively looking for others, but our interest is working with great  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:23):**  farmers in the way that they already work. So we don't have people where we  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:28):**  come in one way and we say you have to switch to another farming method. We  
**[0:09:32-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:32):**  think that's a poor way to find partners and to work with partners. And so  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:40):**  we're very interested in regenerative agricultural partners and we'll look  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:46):**  into them kind of as they approach us.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:48):**  What do you see as the biggest barriers for regenerative agriculture to really  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:52):**  scale?  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:53):**  So I think when we've looked at it, because we've looked at it with some of  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:09:57):**  our conventional guys, I actually think the hard thing about scaling regenerative  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:10:01):**  scaling regenerative agriculture is two parts. One is the integration of  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:10:05):**  animals means you either need to be running a mixed farm or you need to be  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:10:11):**  near an animal production facility that needs manure disposal. So that's one  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:10:18):**  piece. And the other piece is, I actually think a lot of it is that farmers who  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:10:25):**  are really good at operating in a certain way would need a recipe card that  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:10:30):**  said instead of this activity, we are doing this activity. Because what's  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:10:36):**  really hard about it is to figure out a whole new structure of how to like  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:10:41):**  activity sets. And I actually think making it as simple as that as a  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:10:46):**  starting place and then testing on some parts of the land versus others.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:10:50):**  Because we think that in a lot of cases it's risk reduction as much as anything  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:10:56):**  else. So it will do better in worse years. That also means that you have to  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:01):**  be trying it in a worse year so that you can see the difference.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:04):**  Yeah, I see a lot of people coming towards it from the risk perspective and  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:08):**  the cost perspective.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:09):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:10):**  Which obviously makes a lot of sense, especially in the bad years when your  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:14):**  neighbor is suffering probably much more. Well, in a good year, everybody's  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:18):**  doing great. And some people are doing amazing, but you don't see that  
**[0:11:21-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:21):**  different too much, especially in sales prices.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:24):**  Yeah, definitely agree.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:26):**  And so what do you see, let's say in the near future for you as an investor in  
**[0:11:32-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:32):**  regenerative agriculture? What do you need? What do you look for? What are you  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:35):**  excited about? Let's say we took a year from now. What are the main things  
**[0:11:39-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:39):**  you're working on?  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:40):**  We're really interested in finding additional partners in space because we  
**[0:11:45-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:45):**  learn with and from our partners. And then we also are very interested in  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:52):**  kind of the cost part of this. So seeing productivity with lower costs and how  
**[0:11:58-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:58):**  that can work.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:11:59):**  And if you could change one thing in the agriculture sector, if you can wave a  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:03):**  magic wand and then tomorrow morning we'll wake up and something has changed,  
**[0:12:07-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:07):**  what would that be?  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:08):**  It's a great question. I don't know. Like right now, it's really hard to say  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:14):**  that it wouldn't be trade wars where we're at.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:17):**  Which is a fair answer.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:18):**  Yeah, with commodities. But I think that's probably a little bit on the timely  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:25):**  side, more than maybe long-term. In our case, changing the investor side would  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:32):**  probably have the biggest immediate impact to us. And I think the disconnect  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:37):**  there, and it's probably similar actually to have some of the sustainable  
**[0:12:41-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:41):**  agricultural producers, the issues that they face or farmers face in general,  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:48):**  actually think that the finance sector generally under appreciates how many  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:54):**  risks farmers are managing for at any given time. And as a result, under  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:12:59):**  appreciates the value that they bring. And so what we think is really valuable  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:13:04):**  about our model is the ability to keep communities strong and improve those  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:13:10):**  communities by keeping wealth within the communities because of the  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:13:15):**  appreciation shared with the farm partners. But that comes from, it's much  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:13:20):**  more like thinking of farmers as tech entrepreneurs than it is of thinking of  
**[0:13:25-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:13:25):**  farmers like manufacturing people in manufacturing plants. And I think that  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:13:32):**  comes from the respect that I have because I grew up farming and so  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:13:38):**  understand the many risks and what people are managing for. But what's  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:13:44):**  interesting to us on our investor side is that's usually kind of unique. I  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:13:49):**  think for us, I'd like to see us get a bit closer to consumers. So we haven't  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:13:55):**  experimented with whether we can create brands, but I do think that's a really  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:13:59):**  interesting opportunity right now and one that has some potential for  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:06):**  participation over time. I guess the magic wand that I'd want to wave from a  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:13):**  producer perspective is like if you could have a magic light that showed you  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:19):**  if a salesperson for any given thing or the data that you read, if it would work  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:24):**  for you on your place in the way that it's described. And so what I think that  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:29):**  that is, so many people come to each farm every year to try and sell something  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:33):**  that is going to make productivity or the profitability higher. And it's true  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:39):**  that something must do that, but it's also true that not everything that comes  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:42):**  to the door can do that. And so it's very hard to discern what will work and if  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:47):**  you could pick a magic wand it would be being able to tell which of the  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:53):**  innovations in all contexts would work. What we see in sustainable agriculture  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:14:58):**  and Canada does have significant research around sustainable agriculture,  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:03):**  so a lot learned from that research, is the methods that work elsewhere because  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:07):**  of the climactic differences don't always work for us and need innovation  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:13):**  around them to work for us. But I think like if you knew going in what  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:18):**  your best shot at working was, it would sure make life simpler. I think it's an  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:23):**  excellent answer. I mean there's so much noise in this space and so much  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:27):**  information and people coming to sell XYZ to farmers daily, but at the same  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:33):**  time they all have unique circumstances and they only, I mean they run one  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:39):**  slash one and a half season a year, which means maybe 40-50 in their lifetime,  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:44):**  which means they're risking a lot if they are trying one thing and not the  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:48):**  other. And by definition most of the things don't work, which means they  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:51):**  probably choose something that doesn't work. So it's a huge risk and I think  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:54):**  many people forget that, how much they're gambling, plus all the weather risks that  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:15:58):**  only increase, plus all the consumers that constantly change, plus the trade  
**[0:16:01-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:01):**  wars you mentioned before. It's a 6% or 10% or from a very, I mean  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:08):**  obviously a regenerative farm, it's probably worth a lot more than a 10%  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:12):**  from somewhere else because of all the side benefits actually they create  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:15):**  locally and both environmentally and socially. And to end with a question,  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:21):**  I mean obviously not investment advice, but if you would imagine there's an  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:25):**  audience of smart impact investors, or at least they consider themselves smart,  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:29):**  that are enthusiastic about land, enthusiastic about soil, very  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:32):**  enthusiastic about farmers, they know the risk and they would like to get into  
**[0:16:36-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:36):**  the space, they haven't invested yet. What would you advise them to read, what  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:39):**  would you advise them to do to understand more and maybe make their  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:43):**  first investment in the regenerative food and agriculture space?  
**[0:16:47-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:47):**  So our bias, because it's what I understand and as a result what we're invested in  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:16:54):**  and our investors are invested in, is the land base. Meaning there are a lot of  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:17:00):**  places along the regenerative agriculture value chain that you could  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:17:04):**  invest, and in our case we invest in the land. And then from there we grow out any  
**[0:17:10-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:17:10):**  associated businesses. If other investors came with other expertise that they came  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:17:17):**  with, brand views or consumer packaged goods, they would probably have a  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:17:24):**  different place in that value chain that would make a lot of sense for them. But  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:17:27):**  what they can say is, from our standpoint, it's a really low risk investment. So it  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:17:34):**  is a moderate return with low risk, which makes it a high risk adjusted return  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:17:41):**  investment for the land base itself. And I think that's probably especially  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:17:45):**  true as you get into regenerative agriculture, where you are minimizing  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:17:49):**  more risk. And so I guess that's part one. The second is, we don't go into areas  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:17:55):**  without a partner. And we think that that creates considerable value both for us  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:00):**  and for the partners and for the communities. I think if somebody's  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:05):**  looking at sustainability, both to be mindful that sustainability should  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:10):**  probably also include financial sustainability and social sustainability  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:16):**  in addition to environmental. And I guess the final point on that is, if you have  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:23):**  an opportunity to invest in land and to do it locally with a partner, we do think  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:29):**  that that is a better investment over the long term for everyone involved.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:34):**  I mean, I always say final question, then I have a few more. Just on the  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:38):**  meat that we didn't talk about, when you do a deal, are you doing them on a  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:42):**  deal-by-deal basis in a sense? Are you connecting an investor, basically  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:46):**  one-on-one or investors one-on-one to a property? Or is it a fund like structure?  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:52):**  How is it structured for the investor side of things? Yeah, we have a  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:18:55):**  fund like structure. We used to do it on a property basis. So you'd come into  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:00):**  Farm A or Farm B or Farm C. And it doesn't give the investor the  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:04):**  diversification that we think is really valuable. And so we now do it on a pool  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:08):**  fund structure that fund makes co-investments with various farmers.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:12):**  And that's how we build out over time. It has proven to be more valuable for the  
**[0:19:19-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:19):**  investors. And it has proven to be more valuable to the farms, to some extent,  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:27):**  because any investor is less dependent on the performance of the specific asset.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:32):**  Which gives us a bit more of an ability to take a portfolio view, but also gives  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:38):**  gives, I think, the right understanding to both the investors and the farmers.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:43):**  To the farmer it is their farm that they're invested in. And to the investors  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:48):**  they are invested in many farms. And is it a closed-end fund or a continuous  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:53):**  evergreen? Because you mentioned 20 years, which is quite a long period. How do you  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:19:57):**  manage bringing new farms basically into the fund and new investors? We have  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:03):**  closed-ended funds. Our newest fund is actually a perpetual entity with  
**[0:20:08-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:08):**  guaranteed liquidity. So it operates more like a long-term or evergreen. It isn't  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:16):**  open-ended, meaning we don't add capital to it. After we fully invest all of the  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:21):**  capital and the investors then know what investments they have, we have the  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:26):**  auction, or the investors have the option, of reopening that fund. And  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:31):**  otherwise we raise a subsequent fund. Okay, and now I promised the last  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:36):**  question, unless we open a lot more other questions. What do you believe? I'd like  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:40):**  to ask this question. It comes from John Kempf, who I interviewed before. What do  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:44):**  you believe to be true about, he says modern agriculture. I'd like to ask about  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:48):**  regenerative agriculture as well, but let's go with agriculture in general.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:51):**  What do you believe to be true about agriculture that others don't believe to  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:54):**  be true? It depends who your others are, but if it's a financial community,  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:20:59):**  generally speaking, and we hear this on panels when we ask our existing  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:21:05):**  investors, and even really sophisticated institutional investors, farmers are  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:21:09):**  smarter than you think. And that's because they have to be. They manage a  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:21:14):**  lot of variables, they do it fairly systematically or to the best of their  
**[0:21:18-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:21:18):**  ability, generally looking for advice and opportunity. And so we think that all  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:21:25):**  primary producers are managing a lot of complex things and as a result are  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:21:31):**  actually running much more sophisticated businesses. I think that farmers often  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:21:37):**  present to the world and subsequently different and more sophisticated than  
**[0:21:42-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:21:42):**  financial people often expect. So an advice could be find a farmer and or a  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:21:50):**  farmer family and spend some good quality time together to understand the  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:21:54):**  complexity that not only the climate puts to them, but also we as consumers  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:21:59):**  and finance people are basically from a distance putting at them and they have to.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:22:04):**  I don't even know that you have to spend a lot of time. Like if you think  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:22:07):**  through all of the variables that are getting managed and the quantity of  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:22:11):**  capital that they've built over time, I think it becomes relatively  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:22:17):**  straightforward. I want to thank you so much for your time this morning and  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:22:21):**  definitely be checking in on the more regenerative deals you probably are  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:22:25):**  gonna make in the future. And I'd be great. And thank you so much for sharing.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:22:29):**  Thank you. I hope you enjoyed this interview and learned something about

**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:23:24):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:23:29):**  video course investing in regenerative agriculture and food. How to put money to  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:23:33):**  work in regenerating soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:23:37):**  it. Why are we doing this course after 100 interviews and more than 100 hours  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:23:41):**  of audio asking the question how to put money to work in regenerating soils, and  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:23:45):**  I've been following the space since 2011. And recording these podcasts since 2016.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:23:50):**  We thought it was time to share our lessons learned. What have we seen in the  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/#t=0:23:54):**  space over the last years? How have we built our decision making framework?

**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:26):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:29):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:33-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:33):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:34):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:39):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:44):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:49):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:51):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:55):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:00):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:06):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:11):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:14):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:18):**  guests, Ask Me Anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:31-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:31):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:33):**  Welcome to this investing in regenerative agriculture and food podcast webinar.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:37):**  If you haven't been listening to the podcast, definitely do so.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:40):**  You can find it in all your podcast apps, which basically means in Spotify, Apple podcast,  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:47):**  overcast, etc, etc.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:48):**  Just search for investing in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:51):**  And we are usually with John Kemp, the only one that shows up, which is great.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:54):**  And we're trying to answer this question, how to put money to work to regenerate soils  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:57):**  at scale, regenerate people, local communities and ecosystems.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:01):**  And it's been a wild ride.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:02):**  We did over 100 interviews.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:04):**  I think 110 were up now.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:06):**  We did a number of webinars last year.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:08):**  And the community has been growing, which is absolutely amazing.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:10):**  Could never imagine that when we started four and a half years ago, when literally, obviously  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:14):**  nobody was listening.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:15):**  And finally, your favorite app.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:17):**  We also, this is part of a video course we've launched in August.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:22):**  So there's 16 lessons on investing in regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:25):**  And one of them is on nutrient density.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:26):**  And I want to bring on one of the people we always refer to, Dan Kittrich to go a bit  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:30):**  deeper.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:31):**  If you want to find more about the course, it's pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:33):**  So completely up to you.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:35):**  Go to investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course, and you can find out all the  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:39):**  information.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:40):**  So what is regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:41):**  I found a definition and then immediately put under that same sentence.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:44):**  There is no definition because it's a journey, but just to set the stage a bit, it's according  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:49):**  to terra genesis, it's a system of farming principles and practices that increase biodiversity  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:54):**  and riches soils and improves watersheds and enhances ecosystem services.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:57):**  I think the important words here are increase and riches improves and enhances basically  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:02):**  regenerates and it shows that it's a journey.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:04):**  It's not a, you are regenerative or you're not.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:07):**  The question to ask a farmer, are you a regenerative farmer is usually a wrong question because  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:11):**  someone is on a journey.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:12):**  Then as Dan can probably attest, they're never done.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:15):**  I've never met a farmer that says, no, I'm really done with my soils.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:18):**  I'm not going to improve anything next year.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:19):**  They usually have a plan for another 10 years or so.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:23):**  So this is, I always like to show this regenerative versus sustainable versus extractive and degenerative.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:28):**  This is one way of putting it.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:30):**  And this is the other way that I definitely stole from Ethan Soloveyev's amazing paper  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:34):**  or medium post on the regenerative agriculture or the agriculture continuum.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:40):**  Definitely dive into that if you want to know more.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:42):**  I'll put the link also in the show notes below.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:45):**  So a lot of practices, what are these approaches and practices we see often?  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:48):**  The soil is always covered.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:49):**  There are complex rotations in place and time.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:51):**  There's no or very limited tilling and soil disturbance.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:54):**  And then between brackets, because not everybody is doing that, but there's the integration  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:57):**  of animals, which seems to be happening, especially in certain climates very often.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:01):**  So these are a number, a set of practices.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:04):**  Definitely it depends on where you are.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:05):**  It's always context specific.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:08):**  If you want to know more, read that article of Ethan Soloveyev, read a number of books.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:12):**  I mean, definitely David Montgomery is a good introduction.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:14):**  Kiss the Ground as well.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:15):**  Dirt to Soil of Gay Brown.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:17):**  Richard Perkins on YouTube is an amazing resource.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:19):**  Judith Schwartz, who we just re-interviewed on the podcast, written a number of amazing  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:23):**  books.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:24):**  And of course, if you want to listen to the podcast.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:27):**  And now we're going to go to Dan of the Bio-Nutrient Food Association.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:29):**  And we're going to ask all the questions we have for him in terms of nutrients and the  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:34):**  connection to healthy soils.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:36):**  Just to, we already mentioned it, there are going to be weekly webinars starting on February  
**[0:04:39-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:39):**  4th.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:40):**  And this is the 10th annual Soil and Nutrient Conference, which obviously now is going to  
**[0:04:44-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:44):**  be a series of webinars.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:45):**  So go to soilandnutrition.org if you want to know more.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:49):**  And the theme is Weaving Science and Wisdom, which I think we're going to ask some questions  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:53):**  about as well.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:54):**  We had a few questions, people sent that in.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:56):**  So what's the order?  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:57):**  It's going to be basically who sent in this question first.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:59):**  It's going to be answered first.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:01):**  And then we're going to go to the chat for anybody that has a question.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:03):**  Please type it in the chat.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:04):**  We have answers to the questions of other people that in the chat, please make this  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:08):**  as interactive as possible.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:10):**  But we are going to basically kick off with a question of Chris.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:14):**  We are about to launch research into the correlation in soil health and produce nutrient density  
**[0:05:18-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:18):**  and the quality of human health.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:20):**  Are you aware of such similar studies?  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:23):**  So basically, Chris is working on a study like that and asking the question if they  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:27):**  should be aware of other studies like that.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:28):**  Well, I'll just start off by saying what we've been doing at the BFA.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:32):**  We're a 10 year old educational nonprofit.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:35):**  And for the last four years, we've been working on the Real Food Campaign, which is a collaborative  
**[0:05:40-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:40):**  endeavor across nonprofits, for profits, foundations, supply chain, researchers, universities.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:48):**  We're attempting to answer these questions.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:51):**  We've got sort of what we call a three legged stool of objectives.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:54):**  And it all comes from the assumption that there is a connection between all these things,  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:00):**  soil health, plant health and nutrient levels in the crops and human health.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:04):**  I would say cultural health, spiritual health, perhaps a deeper conversation.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:08):**  And so from the perspective of economics, what we do a number of years ago was that  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:12):**  if we could have some way that people could get compensated for the quality of the food,  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:16):**  not the volume of the food, that would be an economic driver, which should facilitate  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:20):**  ideally some much more rapid transitions that have been occurring.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:23):**  And so our thought was the way to do that would be with a handheld sensor where you're  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:27):**  actually able to test this carrot versus that carrot, not just go on a sort of a binary  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:32):**  certification labeling system, organic or biodynamic or whatever.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:37):**  And so our three objectives in this Real Food Campaign are one to build a handheld sensor  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:43):**  that can be used by anybody at a reasonable price point in the supply chain, grower, agronomist,  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:48):**  buyer, wholesaler, packer, processor, retailer, consumer, chef, nutritionist, etc.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:54):**  We want everybody to have access to this empirical assessment.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:58):**  So step one is build an instrument.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:00):**  Is it possible?  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:01):**  This is non-invasive.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:02):**  So flash a light and read the light that bounces back effectively and see what something is.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:06):**  Step two is to actually define what nutrient density is.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:10):**  It's the term that I think, at least when I started looking into these topics was not  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:14):**  out there, maybe 10 or more years ago.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:17):**  And it's sort of one that we've helped to popularize.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:19):**  And there's a general understanding about what it means, but there's actually no technical  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:23):**  definition and that's one of the first things that we think is critically important before  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:27):**  moving forward is to actually have enough data to actually say, you know, this is a  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:31):**  better carrot than that.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:33):**  On what grounds do you make that statement?  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:35):**  That's a very powerful statement.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:36):**  So we propose it should be backed up with some serious data.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:39):**  So step one, build a tool.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:40):**  Step two, figure out what quality is, nutrient density is.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:44):**  And then step three is to correlate it with management practices, environmental conditions,  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:49):**  cell type, climate dynamics, microbiome, epigenetics, cultivars, you know, intention of the grower,  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:55):**  structured water, whatever it is.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:57):**  What are the environmental conditions, polycultures, working with the moon cycles?  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:02):**  What actually correlates with what results?  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:05):**  And so four years ago, we started, we built our first generation meter, a little handheld  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:09):**  open source spectrometer.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:11):**  How to build one for yourself is on GitHub, if you know what that means.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:15):**  And 2018, we built our first lab in Ann Arbor, we tested crops, carrots and spinach from  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:22):**  across North America, mostly the sort of the northeast quadrant of North America, but we  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:26):**  did, you know, across the country, close to 1000 samples, grocery stores, farms, organic,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:30):**  non-organic, we were able to identify some variations that were quite dramatic.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:34):**  I think it was between 3x and 18x was the variation and the minerals, the best carrot  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:39):**  to the worst carrot in copper, the best spinach to the worst spinach in iron.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:44):**  And then it was I think 75 to one to 200 to one on the antioxidants and polyphenols, depending  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:49):**  on which crop and which compound.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:51):**  So we identified significant variation there in supply chain.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:55):**  And it did not correlate with organic or local or farm, it really did not.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:59):**  So then 2019, we added four more crops, we added lettuce and kale and cherry tomatoes  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:05):**  and grapes, and got a much more broad range from around North America.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:10):**  And we also worked with about 35 farms to document the environmental conditions management  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:16):**  practices, soil type, fertility program, all that stuff, and sending the soil, the crops  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:20):**  group in with the crops for assessment, we did that with about 35 farms in 2019, that  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:26):**  would have been and from that process, we were able to build the first calibrations  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:30):**  for our meter, so that now on those six crops, we have it so that you can flash a light and  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:36):**  get a top quartile bottom quartile middle 50%, you know, that would be green, red, yellow,  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:41):**  red, yellow, green, basically, on antioxidants and polyphenols, which is not a definition  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:46):**  of nutrient density, but it's a stand in for the time being.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:48):**  So we have proven that we can build a handheld consumer priced light flasher that can give  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:55):**  you readings that are scientifically solid on nutrients, compounds in crops.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:00):**  So yeah, then 2020, we went up to 20 crops.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:04):**  We added a whole bunch of other things, potatoes and beets and apples and blueberries and leeks  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:09):**  and Swiss chard and squash and you know, a number of other things, oats and wheat.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:14):**  We have now another lab at Chico State in California.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:18):**  And our third lab is in partnership with Valor X in France.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:21):**  And so we were able to get samples in 2020 from not just across the US but across Europe  
**[0:10:28-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:28):**  as well.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:29):**  And it worked with about 150 farms to do that and a much better app and data collection  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:33):**  process and sampling protocols with the soil metric and management metrics.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:39):**  So to answer the question, I'm not aware of anybody else doing anything like this.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:44):**  I am aware of other groups.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:46):**  I think the Rockefellers are working with some people to do I think it's called periodic  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:50):**  table of food index PTFI or something.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:54):**  There's various things that are out there.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:55):**  I think TECO Origin you've had on a couple times Coon, they're doing some very interesting  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:59):**  stuff in the supply chain and correlating to USDA averages.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:03):**  So there are people out there that are working on various pieces of this.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:06):**  But as far as really trying to tease out the A, what is nutrient density, not what's the  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:13):**  USDA average, but B, what is soil health and what causes it, it requires a very broad,  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:19):**  collaborative, open, systemic process.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:22):**  It can't be a reductionist top down one lab, one research institute, it has to be a deep  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:28):**  collaborative process.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:29):**  We've been really lucky to help start OpenTeam here in North America, which is all lining  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:35):**  a lot of the soil metric stuff and their PWA, their universal sign in app.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:40):**  That's all basically stuff that we started with Real Food Campaign that's now able to  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:43):**  take on much deeper systemic function through what OpenTeam is doing, etc.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:48):**  So yeah, not to sort of pat ourselves on the back, but I think we're on the cutting edge.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:52):**  Unfortunately, yeah, they're not too many.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:55):**  Well, the partnerships, we've got an amazing network of allies.  
**[0:11:58-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:58):**  Absolutely impressive.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:00):**  And, and you've been on it, obviously, for quite a while.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:03):**  We have two more questions of people that sent in before and then we're going to get  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:06):**  to your question, John and Tommy, obviously.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:09):**  But first, Eric, who basically asks the opposite question.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:12):**  So what about the bad stuff in food?  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:14):**  How much of that is measurable?  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:17):**  And how much do we want to know?  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:19):**  I've had different answers to that question over time, depending on how I want to spin  
**[0:12:22-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:22):**  the conversation.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:24):**  My answer for the longest time has been, it's basically impossible to do a really good job  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:30):**  with toxins present.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:33):**  So it's only when the microbiome is functioning well in the soil, around the roots, in the  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:38):**  roots, in the leaves, on the leaf surface, it's only when the plant's microbiome is flourishing  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:43):**  that we should expect these levels of complexity and sophistication in nutrition, which we  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:49):**  think is what nutrient density is.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:50):**  I think it was your answer as well, when I asked about hydroponics, that there was a  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:55):**  similar, like it's very difficult to cheat with nutrients.  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:58):**  This is our hypothesis, right?  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:59):**  We haven't proved it yet, but that's why we're actually trying to research is to say, our  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:04):**  understanding is those things we call flavor aroma that correlate with health giving attribute,  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:09):**  correlate with pest and disease resistance, et cetera, are complex compounds that are  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:13):**  basically most efficiently built in symbiosis by the plant with microbes.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:17):**  And so the more toxins that are present, likely the less sophisticated the nutritional value  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:23):**  will be.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:24):**  So would it be nice to be able to test all those things as well?  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:27):**  Yes.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:28):**  Those toxins are present generally at the degree of parts per billion and nutrients  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:34):**  are generally present in the parts per million.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:37):**  So before we can have a handheld sensor that can test toxins, by definition, we'll have  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:42):**  to have one that tests nutrients.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:44):**  Would it be able to go straight to parts per billion?  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:46):**  That would be awesome.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:47):**  But right now we aren't at parts per million.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:50):**  So it's a process.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:52):**  I think it's a great answer actually.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:54):**  You cannot measure everything.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:55):**  You need to look for proxies.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:56):**  And we're very much, I'm a person we both know quite well that I think we're in the  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:00):**  stone age of nutrient density measurements, et cetera.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:02):**  And we're, we're just literally scratching the surface, which is very interesting.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:06):**  Anyway, Eric had another question about the tight linkage between nutrient density and  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:09):**  food as medicine.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:10):**  Like once we've established, you mentioned that before, like, how are we going to connect  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:15):**  the specific nutrients, are we able to connect the specific nutrients to certain health outcomes?  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:19):**  Well, we don't even have a definition for nutrient density yet.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:24):**  And I think we just have to be humble about the fact that this is a process and these  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:27):**  are the questions.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:28):**  And there's an amazing web of thoughtful people with different skill sets that are coalescing  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:35):**  around this.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:36):**  The food as medicine work that's being done, at least here in North America is very impressive.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:41):**  Even with the Obamacare, you know, there's major, I think you had Catherine couch on.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:46):**  Just went out a few weeks ago.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:49):**  So, I mean, it's coming from different directions.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:51):**  It's coming from the regenerative soil health thing.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:54):**  It's coming from the consumers that want nutrition.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:57):**  It's coming from the health industry.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:00):**  Some of the incentives are there for people to be healthier, right?  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:02):**  It's in the interest of the insurance company for people to be healthier.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:05):**  And so they have a reason to want to work with us.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:07):**  And there's all kinds of brilliant researchers at universities and everything else as well.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:10):**  So I do think that we're going to get to a point where we will be able to have some biomarkers  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:18):**  that we can assess on ourselves and we'll be able to overlay that with the nutrients  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:24):**  and specific crops and really begin to dial it in very nicely for those who want to push  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:28):**  that envelope.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:29):**  Yeah, I think the conclusion, I mean, one of the points with Catherine was, and they  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:33):**  just for our background, they delivered over a million medically tailored, which was the  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:37):**  first time I heard that word, medically tailored organic meals to low income people coming  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:41):**  out of a hospital after treatment.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:43):**  And we really quite quickly, or to still have an hour of an interview, but come to the conclusion,  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:48):**  like that's where like the most impact of nutrient dense food is not going to be with  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:51):**  the people that already have the wealth to buy organic or that are already going to the  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:56):**  farmer's market.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:57):**  It's going to be with the people that obviously can't or don't at the moment for a variety  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:00):**  of reasons.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:02):**  And there it's the biggest health impact is going to be because the gap is just much bigger  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:06):**  from what they're eating currently, from what they could be eating if the system was there.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:10):**  Catherine shared some numbers.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:11):**  It's the cost of delivering a 12 week meal plan compared to people going back to the  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:17):**  hospital after 10 weeks, because they literally run out of food, money or medicine.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:20):**  It was, I think, one to 10 or something.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:22):**  It was pretty crazy, the potential.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:24):**  And they're still doing a lot of research into it.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:26):**  This is normal organic.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:27):**  This is not even measuring for nutrient density.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:29):**  This is not even going really deep.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:31):**  This is just a healthy meal.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:33):**  This is just California taking an interesting lead here.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:36):**  But John is asking a very good question, actually.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:38):**  Like if it doesn't correlate with organic local, what guidance can we use to buy the  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:42):**  best food?  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:43):**  I think a lot of people in the call might be wondering, okay, just said organic doesn't.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:46):**  So what should I do?  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:48):**  Or what should I focus at when I'm buying food?  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:52):**  This is the central point is that the labels don't correlate with, I mean, organic will  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:59):**  probably correlate with less toxic.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:01):**  Sure.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:02):**  But plenty of local farmers use lots of chemicals until like crazy.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:06):**  So it has everything to do with the practices and the environmental conditions.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:10):**  And I would suggest the intention and the nature of the grower.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:13):**  I'm pretty certain that's going to be a big piece of it.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:15):**  I'm not sure how we'll tease that out.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:17):**  But it's your tongue is your best metric.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:21):**  And that's all we're trying to do is develop some rudimentary function of a tongue that  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:25):**  we can flash a light at things and give people an idea of where things stand.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:29):**  The reflectometer is a good tool right now.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:31):**  What is a reflector?  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:32):**  A BRX reflector.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:34):**  Just a simple BRX meter you can buy.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:36):**  Still the best empirical metric we've got right now, we think.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:41):**  But there's not really a lot of data correlating BRX of nutrient density.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:43):**  So we're working on it.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:45):**  That's the idea is that if we can complete this process, which I think we will in the  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:50):**  next couple of years have some pretty good stuff, we're already moving right along.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:54):**  Then we will have a metric that can be used by an empirical assessment tool that can be  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:59):**  used by anybody in supply chain.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:01):**  But that to assess, but also we can feed that data right back to the growers to help them  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:06):**  understand where their low hanging fruit is.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:09):**  This is part of the thing that we're doing with Open Team is we're building this sort  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:13):**  of digital coffee shop where each grower who's part of the process can see their results  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:19):**  and their environmental conditions and management practices next to other growers results and  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:24):**  management practices and environmental conditions and geographies.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:28):**  And so we can facilitate a conversation amongst growers about what did you do and when did  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:33):**  you do it and how did you get that result?  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:35):**  And we can see where we stand and they can see where they stand.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:37):**  And so we're really trying to create this framework.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:40):**  I think the instrument is nice and it will be great and quite powerful and the implications  
**[0:18:44-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:44):**  are amazing.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:46):**  But until we can support the growers in doing the job, what's going to happen is that the  
**[0:18:50-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:50):**  buyers are going to say to the farmers, what the hell?  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:51):**  I don't want your stuff, but who else is going to get?  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:53):**  It's going to be uncomfortable.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:54):**  So as a farmer myself, we have to foundationally create the dynamic where people can be supported  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:59):**  in the transition as well as possible.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:01):**  They need data for that.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:02):**  I remember the last interview we did with Greg of Teak Origin, they saw no difference  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:07):**  in their measurements and their research in organic on the supermarket shelf versus non-organic  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:12):**  on the fresh side.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:13):**  But when they went on the farm level, they saw an enormous difference.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:16):**  So somewhere there in, I think there was in strawberries and some other things, somewhere  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:20):**  along from the farm door or gates to the supermarket, that stuff gets lost.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:24):**  And it was an enormous difference in terms of what they could see, what are healthy and  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:28):**  useful nutrients and somewhere along the lines, along the supply chain, basically that got  
**[0:19:33-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:33):**  lost.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:34):**  So it sort of suggests freshness is very, very important.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:37):**  I'll just say that what we have found so far from our data, this is just the 2019 data.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:41):**  We'll have the 2020 data probably available formally in April, but we'll have the raw  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:45):**  stuff next month sometime.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:46):**  What we found is that cover crops and minimal or no till, that's the thing that shows most  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:52):**  of the wealth when nutrient level standpoint, organic, but not certified shows reasonably  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:58):**  well, but not as well as those two.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:01):**  Organic is just right at the mean, greenhouse grown is reasonably below and hydroponic is  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:07):**  dramatically below.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:09):**  So that's the preliminary results we've got so that we can see broadly, there are classes  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:13):**  of management and label that correlate in that range.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:18):**  There were sort of answers to the question of, Tommy, where are the nutrients at?  
**[0:20:22-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:22):**  Can you say that Regen is the answer?  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:24):**  I mean, is the answer, I think it's too early, but there are some signs that it's at least  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:28):**  practices or approaches that helps soil health seem to show some signs, but we're very early  
**[0:20:33-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:33):**  in this process.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:34):**  We have every reason to think that soil health is the foundational metric causal in nutrient  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:38):**  density.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:40):**  What is soil health?  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:42):**  And it's not the practices, it's the process as the biodynamic people would say, just like  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:46):**  you said about regenerative is a process.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:48):**  Regenerative is just a new word that came up in the last three years.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:51):**  I mean, we've had the words for the past 40 years to talk about this exact same thing.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:55):**  I call it biological ag.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:56):**  When I was young and impressionable, I went to the acres conferences 15 years ago and  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:00):**  that's what they called it was biological ag.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:02):**  And so that's what I've always associated with, but it's all part and parcel of the  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:05):**  same thing, I think.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:06):**  Yeah, we're going definitely up the hype cycle at the moment with regenerate or regeneration  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:10):**  in general, regenerative ag, et cetera.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:13):**  I'm interested because it is going to attract a lot of other people.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:16):**  I'm also interested when we go down the hype cycle again and we get to the real part, which  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:20):**  is building the whole thing up.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:22):**  It's starting to happen.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:23):**  We're starting to realize it's not a label, but it's the thing.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:25):**  And it's not so easy.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:26):**  You have to answer some very deep questions, which you alluded to in your intro as well.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:31):**  This goes way beyond changing a few with all respect, that's extremely difficult, but a  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:35):**  few management practices on your farm.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:37):**  This is a whole different level.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:38):**  But people need to start and a few steps at a time.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:41):**  Few things done differently that aren't that hard will have a dramatically positive effect.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:45):**  Which is very hopeful.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:46):**  Let's put it that way.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:47):**  It's really easy to do better because most things are being done very poorly.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:51):**  Which is a good point.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:52):**  Like most agriculture you see, not to bash any farmers, is done, let's say suboptimal  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:57):**  in terms of biodiversity, biomass, life.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:00):**  And in terms of yields and results, like somebody called it, I think it was the head of the  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:05):**  savory hub in Norway or the Nordic saying most farms or landscapes you see are underperforming  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:11):**  landscapes.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:12):**  And there's an enormous potential.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:13):**  And we have to imagine or believe that even though we haven't seen it for the last 40  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:18):**  years, but there's a lot possible.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:19):**  We've got all kinds of documentation, all kinds of people globally that are doing amazing  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:23):**  work.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:24):**  We've got every reason to think this is true and possible.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:26):**  And what we're starting to see is that the market is paying premiums for these kinds  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:31):**  of nutritional metrics.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:32):**  So farmers are already getting 5, 10 percent in the most rudimentary stuff that's being  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:37):**  done right now.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:38):**  I just did an interview for, I think it was John Deere's magazine Ploughed or something  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:42):**  like that.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:43):**  I'm not sure what it's called.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:44):**  Which is ironic.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:45):**  It wasn't Ploughed, it's something else.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:46):**  It was like that.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:47):**  It was like, oh.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:49):**  But they got an article coming out in April about nutrient density and all the researchers  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:53):**  and all the stuff that's being done at universities and the farmers that are getting margins right  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:56):**  now, the market is already moving there.  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:58):**  Quality.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:59):**  So if you can support the growers with the basic practices and then the basic metrics,  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:03):**  this is where money comes in as a very powerful tool.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:07):**  Which actually is a nice bridge to Sudhish's question.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:09):**  Which segments of the market do you anticipate or maybe see already if it's already happening  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:14):**  to be or will be early adapters?  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:16):**  Are there certain crops, certain ingredients, certain like what parts of the market you  
**[0:23:19-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:19):**  see are first movers in terms of quality?  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:22):**  I think it's a web.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:23):**  It's a web of all these different people and businesses and organizations and universities  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:28):**  and crops and different parts of the country and the parts of the world.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:32):**  It's like a mycelial Mac.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:34):**  We're all buzzing back and forth and talking and sharing.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:38):**  It's like it's coming up together.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:40):**  So you can point out a company here or an organization there or an ingredient.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:46):**  But I feel like it's actually a living ecosystem of knowledge and growth that's going on right  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:50):**  now.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:51):**  And have you seen a change a lot?  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:52):**  This is going to be a question also in the interview.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:54):**  But like the last few years, we talked almost two years ago and you've been in this space  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:59):**  for quite a while, obviously as a grower and also with the Bio nutrient Food Association.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:03):**  Have you seen that mycelium web, let's say getting stronger, that the more carbon is  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:07):**  being pumped through the system and the connections are getting better and stronger and more communication  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:12):**  is happening?  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:13):**  Or is it like still very slow burning and slowly building?  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:16):**  Yeah, I grew up on an organic farm in the 80s.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:19):**  And when the word wasn't of organic wasn't out there yet.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:24):**  And my parents helped write some of the first standards back then.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:26):**  And that was an absolute, you know, grassroots counterculture movement that was very small  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:34):**  and didn't have a lot of notoriety and watched organic come in.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:38):**  I mean, when I was young, I was taught that the university people were bad and that there  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:43):**  was nothing to benefit from dealing with the USDA, that they basically were, you know,  
**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:48):**  there was no overlap potential, let's just say.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:51):**  And you know, NRCS and organic coming in and we've had the biodynamics, we've had permaculture  
**[0:24:58-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:58):**  come, we've had slow food, we've had any number of Western price, these sort of building social  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:06):**  movements of things coalescing.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:08):**  And then, yeah, the natural foods product market space has gotten massive.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:13):**  There's a lot of money in it now.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:15):**  And so I see regenerative like it's been people who can come from that like scale space and  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:21):**  say, we got to have a way to pitch this, market this, get some buzz going.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:26):**  NRCS is doing amazing things.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:28):**  What is the NRCS just for people that are not in the US?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:31):**  Natural Resources Conservation Service.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:32):**  They're a wing of the USDA, sort of the US Federal Agriculture Service.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:38):**  It seems to be moving, but it's just from I mean, I live in a bubble, obviously.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:41):**  So it seems to be, I mean, since we started the podcast, which is four and a half years  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:45):**  ago, since I started looking at the space, which is 10 years ago now, wow, it's been  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:50):**  one hell of a ride, I can say and especially the last years, it's really grew.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:54):**  And this whole thing with the climate too.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:56):**  I mean, I think that there's beginning to be a real, a real serious understanding that  
**[0:26:01-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:01):**  we're out of whack.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:02):**  I get a deck, I think every other week of somebody setting up a soil carbon marketplace  
**[0:26:06-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:06):**  now.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:07):**  So I can actually compare because I have so many, but it's definitely showing and all  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:10):**  people not from the ag space, which is interesting and dangerous at the same time, because I  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:13):**  would always point them, please spend a lot of time on farms first.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:17):**  But it's interesting that people from outside the food and ag space are getting enthusiastic  
**[0:26:21-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:21):**  and starting to get in.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:22):**  And we need that energy, I think we need that.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:24):**  And I would say that, you know, foundationally, they're focusing on the carbon, which is not  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:27):**  the place to focus.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:29):**  But whatever, that's part of the learning process.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:32):**  We just released an episode with Walter Jäne.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:36):**  Please stop focusing on carbon and focus on the water cycle.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:39):**  And it's, yeah, it's...  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:40):**  But I mean, the carbon cycle, the water cycle, yes, they are sort of parts of the scientific  
**[0:26:44-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:44):**  framework.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:45):**  But the question really, from a cultural standpoint is what's going to cause the money to flow.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:51):**  And I put my chips on nutrient density.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:54):**  I'm pretty sure when it all settles out, that the inherent quality of the food is going  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:59):**  to be the economic lever that's going to have the most capacity to facilitate shift.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:05):**  In the pockets of farmers that are doing well.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:08):**  Just as you make many more hundreds of dollars per acre or thousands of dollars per acre  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:13):**  on the quality of the crop than you do on the carbon, it's got to be at least an order  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:17):**  of magnitude more.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:19):**  And certainly you can do ecosystem services and do all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:22):**  But I mean, add all those payments up.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:24):**  And I'll bet you that when plants are healthier, your cost of production is lower, your margins  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:28):**  are better.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:30):**  So I think we're making serious progress.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:32):**  In my experience, you know, focusing on nutrient density, talking about it 10 years ago, the  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:35):**  concept that there was a variation of nutrients in food was not something that was accepted.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:40):**  Simply not accepted.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:41):**  Carrot was a carrot.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:43):**  And at this point in time, a lot of people I consider to be thoughtful are starting to  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:47):**  say, you know, there's something to this nutrient density is a piece of the puzzle.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:50):**  Let's see how big that puzzle is.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:51):**  Oh, that piece is in the puzzle.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:53):**  Let's try to get through a few more questions.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:55):**  I see one here on bio-photon.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:56):**  Yeah, she has to leave, but she had a question about bio-photon.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:01):**  Yes, Wilhelmina.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:02):**  Absolutely, Pops work and all that.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:05):**  I've just been in touch with some people that are, have taken over his lab or are working  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:10):**  with his people now that he's passed.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:12):**  I started out thinking that it was the coherence, the vibrational coherence of the food that  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:18):**  we're looking for and have strategically decided to focus on the physical substance, quote  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:23):**  unquote, the minerals and compounds, because that's where we're operating from in 3D 21st  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:28):**  century mass culture.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:31):**  We are not really comfortable with the topic of vibration and coherence and consciousness  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:35):**  and things like that.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:36):**  A lot of farmers are very comfortable with that and a lot of farmers aren't, but there's  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:40):**  a great, you're talking about getting a concept out there, like regenerative, getting a concept  
**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:45):**  like nutrient density out there.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:46):**  If we say nutrient density means photonic coherence, people are going to write us off.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:51):**  If we say nutrient density means three X more nutrients, they're going to be intrigued.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:56):**  Of course.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:58):**  So if it doesn't correlate with bio-photonics, we have not succeeded.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:00):**  But yes, in all those things.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:02):**  A question on the seeds.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:03):**  Dina, is it possible that the quality of the seed matters as well?  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:06):**  I would say it's as much as 50% of the potential, maybe just 30%.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:11):**  I would say it is the largest single piece where the greatest potential for improvement  
**[0:29:17-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:17):**  is.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:18):**  Like the biggest potential that is lost is already lost when you buy the seed, if it's  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:22):**  a poor quality.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:23):**  So I think it's an absolutely massive piece of the puzzle and it's quite easy to improve  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:28):**  seed quality.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:29):**  All you need to do is grow plants in a healthy environment and save their seed.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:34):**  Ideally in the environment where you're going to be growing them next year, because they  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:36):**  will evolve to that microbiome.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:40):**  It's not just the seed of the plant, it's the seed of its microbiome.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:44):**  And where was that from?  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:45):**  What was the health of the mother plant, but what was the microbiome of the mother plant?  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:49):**  And does that seed have the colostrum on it it needs that is appropriate for that ecosystem  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:54):**  to really establish that symbiotic function?  
**[0:29:57-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:57):**  We need a lot more local seed companies.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:59):**  Well, locally, regionally, yeah, we have to take ownership of that.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:03):**  And of course, foundationally, different cultivars have different inherent potentials.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:08):**  And a lot of what's being sold right now as seed hybrids and things like that are inherently  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:12):**  weak.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:13):**  Next one back on polycropping and crop diversity.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:17):**  Do you see that as an important viral yet or not yet or not at all?  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:22):**  Foundationally.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:23):**  Foundationally.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:24):**  The bar is low right now, so you can do a much better job than is averagely being done  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:28):**  on a monoculture.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:29):**  Let's say the next five years, maybe the bar is very low.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:31):**  And then as a grower, you probably have to start paying attention because others are  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:35):**  going to catch up.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:36):**  But if you're jumping on this train now or have been for a while, you're probably going  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:40):**  to be coming out ahead.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:42):**  And as John Kemp has shown, you can do a really good job with monocultures.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:46):**  If you know how to manage it and dial it in, you can do a really good job.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:48):**  But I think still polycultures have the upper hand.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:51):**  Biodynamic, any difference with organic versus the rest so far in the data is asking Cefalino.  
**[0:30:57-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:57):**  We didn't get enough biodynamic samples in.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:59):**  It was 20 or 30 samples in 2019.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:01):**  We got a bunch more in 2020.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:03):**  It's been interesting with the reports and the lab people.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:06):**  And sometimes like biodynamics is like way high than sometimes biodynamics is low.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:10):**  And I'm like, basically it comes down to the fact we didn't have enough data points.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:13):**  So we need more meat, any animal protein you have looked at or will be looking at?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:18):**  We are a charitable organization.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:21):**  We run on donations.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:23):**  So make some donations people if you want this to be done.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:26):**  Basically on charitable donations, three labs.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:28):**  I'm not sure how many thousand samples of crops and soil at this point, you know, software,  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:32):**  data platforms, et cetera.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:34):**  We simply have not gotten to animal products yet.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:36):**  I absolutely want to, but it costs money.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:40):**  And because we're keeping all of the data in the commons, there's no investors who are  
**[0:31:46-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:46):**  supporting our work.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:47):**  They can't because we aren't offering any IP.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:50):**  So we'd love to do animal products.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:52):**  And if anybody knows anybody that wants to be serious about engaging that conversation,  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:56):**  please do reach out.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:57):**  We might have some people anyway, for everyone to make some donations, if you can, obviously.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:01):**  Great.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:02):**  If you know people who can do strategic things, that's very interesting.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:05):**  Get in touch with them.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:06):**  If you can't get in touch with me and I will get you in touch with them.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:10):**  Supply and distribution chain.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:11):**  So in terms of process, I mean, I think the answer is going to be the same.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:15):**  We don't have money yet to do that.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:16):**  But the like, let's say when it leaves the farm until the shelf, whatever shelf or until  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:21):**  the plate, have you seen the things?  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:24):**  Are you planning things?  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:25):**  What's as we saw with Greg, basically, Greg Schumacher, optic origin, the difference of  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:30):**  farm gate to supermarket shelves was enormous.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:33):**  So what's the story with freshness processing, etc?  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:36):**  The way we've been designing our work so far is that we will take the crop that the consumer  
**[0:32:40-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:40):**  has access to and test it.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:42):**  And so that's, we haven't done the complete like, breakdown over time.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:47):**  I want to say about what Greg had done in the Tico Origin interview, that a lot of what  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:52):**  they started with was junk, the raw crop was junk.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:55):**  And then so the fact that it just, you know, fell apart in five days or seven days is not  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:00):**  surprising.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:01):**  I do think that's true.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:02):**  Most food as we've been able to see, I mean, the bell curves on the data points are that  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:06):**  the vast majority of the crops are at about the 15th or 20th percentile of the variation  
**[0:33:12-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:12):**  percent.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:13):**  So like, if copper in carrots goes from 10 to 100, or we'll say from one to 100 parts  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:19):**  per million, it wouldn't be that high.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:22):**  We'll see iron and spinach, if iron and spinach goes from five to 100 parts per million, then  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:29):**  what we found is that the vast majority of the spinach samples, probably like 70% of  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:34):**  the spinach samples are between that, you know, say 10 and 20.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:40):**  So range goes from five to 100.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:43):**  The vast majority of the samples are between 10 and 20.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:47):**  That's where the peak of the bell curve is.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:49):**  That's what the USDA average says is the level of iron and spinach.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:53):**  That's what the model say.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:54):**  Our data says that most spinach has this much iron in it.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:57):**  But the potential is this.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:59):**  And that's what we're doing is saying what's the potential?  
**[0:34:02-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:02):**  No one else seems to be looking at that critical point.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:04):**  And so what Tico Origin is looking at is stuff that is that in the middle, that stuff from  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:09):**  the farm gate, and then yes, it does break down and dissipate over the five days or nine  
**[0:34:13-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:13):**  days it takes to get to the shelf.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:15):**  I will say they're not looking at new elements.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:18):**  So things like copper and zinc are not going to dissipate like he was talking about.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:22):**  He was talking about things like vitamin C, right, he was talking about compounds, and  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:25):**  that those really start at low levels and then break down easily when the plant's not  
**[0:34:29-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:29):**  coherent.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:30):**  So the supply chain is I mean, we're planning to look at it, I think the most important  
**[0:34:33-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:33):**  point is that if it starts out junk, it's going to be junk pretty soon afterwards.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:37):**  If it starts out good, the shelf life in our experiences, it maintains much more.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:43):**  So plus it has a potential, much nutrients, and you're going to have 12 times as much  
**[0:34:48-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:48):**  in two weeks, because the other one just crashed.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:49):**  And we're going to be selective with some of the questions because we simply have too  
**[0:34:52-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:52):**  many as always.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:54):**  Somebody asked how we're going to make sure people are not gonna selectively breed or  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:59):**  over supplement their soils to get to commercially sellable nutrients.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:03):**  Like what's the cheatability?  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:05):**  I think is if I can summarize the question.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:07):**  I hope people will be breeding plants and will be selecting types of microbes and will  
**[0:35:13-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:13):**  be sourcing different amendments to maximize nutrient levels and crops.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:20):**  That's the whole point is that people can use their creativity to accomplish this objective.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:25):**  The foundational thing behind all that is the only way to get high levels of these sophisticated  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:31):**  compounds, antioxidants, polyphenols, terpenoids, alkaloids, there's all these fancy names  
**[0:35:36-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:36):**  sounding compounds.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:38):**  The only way to get them is when the microbiome is flourishing.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:42):**  So anything you do that's going to not support the microbiome will show up poorly.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:48):**  So you want to put lots of synthetic nutrients in.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:51):**  If you do it in a way to support the microbiome, then you're not going to get those compounds.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:56):**  It's an important point.  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:57):**  I'm not sure if I'm conveying it sufficiently.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:58):**  No, no, I get it.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:00):**  And I see Yen's question is already answered by Dina.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:02):**  So that's great.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:03):**  If you want to know more, definitely check out this sort of food web.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:06):**  Erin is asking an interesting question about water.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:09):**  What about ionized, structured, vitalized?  
**[0:36:11-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:11):**  What's your thought on water?  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:12):**  I think we can do a whole podcast on that, but I'm going to ask you to share your short  
**[0:36:16-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:16):**  thoughts on water.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:18):**  That the structure, nature, vibration of the water is extraordinarily important.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:24):**  And that's going to be one of those things that I think our data is going to show.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:27):**  And we're going to have the space to tease it out.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:30):**  Let's create a scientific framework where we can document all the environmental conditions  
**[0:36:35-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:35):**  and then monitor the results and see what shows up.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:38):**  I think there's something there.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:40):**  And I don't know what.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:41):**  We don't know, but there's something there.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:42):**  And Beck is asking a question on the inequality side.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:46):**  So how about the potential equality issues around monetizing nutrient density and how  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:51):**  this might increase the health outcomes gap of those in the highest and the lowest socioeconomic  
**[0:36:56-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:56):**  brackets?  
**[0:36:57-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:57):**  How do we make sure everyone has access to this stuff?  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:00):**  Especially ones that don't now.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:03):**  Through a process of open transparency and empowerment, we have allies across the culture.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:09):**  We've got people that are doing work in schools, people that are doing work.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:12):**  I mean, here in the US, we've got a bunch of programs where people get effectively free  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:16):**  food.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:17):**  Once we can align the incentives and understand that the cost of healthcare correlates directly  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:22):**  with how healthy people are and the quality of food correlates with that.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:27):**  If we have even the most rudimentarily progressive governmental structures, a lot of the people  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:33):**  who don't have enough money to get food that are getting a lot of their food from the government  
**[0:37:38-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:38):**  structures, whether it's schools or however it works, they can be a massive leverage player  
**[0:37:44-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:44):**  in this process.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:45):**  So our thought is if there's a race to the top, if farmers are basically getting paid  
**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:51):**  premiums for doing a better job, then where the bottom is now is below where it's going  
**[0:37:56-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:56):**  to be in two years.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:37:57):**  Below where it's going to be in five years.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:00):**  The thought is if we have an inspiration for farmers to do a better job, then whatever  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:04):**  is in the supply chain is going to be better regardless.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:08):**  If I had whatever, I mean, a trillion dollars, maybe I could guarantee anything like that.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:13):**  But these are things that we don't all have control of.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:14):**  All we can do is create a structure to empower as much as possible and trust that the broader  
**[0:38:18-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:18):**  cultural framework is going to support it.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:20):**  Build a movement.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:21):**  It's a very, very important question, but very tricky.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:26):**  The last one, which I would like to ask you on a vision question, which I saw somebody  
**[0:38:30-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:30):**  asking.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:31):**  Quick question from Eric.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:32):**  How much does it cost to set up a lab like that and run it?  
**[0:38:35-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:35):**  Because I think running it is more crucial than setting it up.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:38):**  I mean, they're pretty basic.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:39):**  Well, in that, I mean, we're actually getting a lot of metrics.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:42):**  I think it's $25,000 or $30,000 in hardware.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:45):**  It's not much.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:46):**  And then running it for, let's say, a year.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:49):**  How much do people cost?  
**[0:38:50-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:50):**  How much does your staff cost?  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:51):**  How many do you need?  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:52):**  How many people do you need to run it?  
**[0:38:53-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:53):**  Well, how many samples are you running?  
**[0:38:56-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:56):**  The lab in France started off with one person this year.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:38:58):**  They got it operational.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:00):**  They ran a few hundred samples.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:02):**  And then they'll probably staff up as we get more samples coming through.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:06):**  So let's say relatively cheap, but still it needs to be financed.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:10):**  Six figures.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:11):**  Yeah, I think $100,000 or 100,000 euros should be sufficient to get something basically operational.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:17):**  Do you envision these labs, like many of these labs, to be regional and local?  
**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:22):**  Global is an objective and more sophisticated than they are now, but we have to start somewhere.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:26):**  Yeah, the idea is that this is a global collaboration.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:29):**  So we don't have anybody in Africa right now, nobody in Asia, nobody in South America.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:32):**  But it is a shout out to get that done.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:35):**  Anybody who wants to partner with us, we're very, the whole idea is that we're in this  
**[0:39:39-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:39):**  together and none of us can do it by ourselves.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:41):**  So reach out if you are interested.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:44):**  Dan at Biodutrient.org.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:46):**  I would definitely share that and be ready for some emails.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:49):**  Any research on the heirloom boom that we have seen and actually see it, still see on  
**[0:39:56-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:56):**  the seeds, etc.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:57):**  Have you seen any signs in the data so far that those varieties or those seeds have been  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:02):**  better or worse or not?  
**[0:40:03-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:03):**  We can easily say that the variety has a very significant impact.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:07):**  The variety of the crop has a significant impact on its inherent capacity to become  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:13):**  more or less nutritious.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:14):**  I think again, the microbiome piece is a key component of this seed by two purple brandy  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:21):**  wine tomato seeds from different growers that will behave much differently, not just because  
**[0:40:26-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:26):**  of the microbiome, actually because of the epigenetics as well.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:29):**  But yeah, I would say on average, it looks like the seeds that were selected for flavor  
**[0:40:37-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:37):**  have a better inherent capacity to be nutritious than the ones that are selected for processing  
**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:41):**  capacity.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:42):**  I think it's a great one.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:43):**  I want to end with the last one and be conscious of everyone's time.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:46):**  Wallace Green asked a great question.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:48):**  I'm just going to read it out loud and I'm going to ask then to create a vision.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:51):**  So imagine the year is 2030.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:52):**  For the past 10 years, big ag producers embraced the core principles and practices and approaches  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:40:58):**  I would add to that of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:00):**  The fields of monoculture look dramatically different, as does the farm.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:03):**  What does the fields look like?  
**[0:41:04-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:04):**  The farm, are these growers selling the same to the same customers or has that changed  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:08):**  too?  
**[0:41:09-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:09):**  So bring us to 2030.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:10):**  What do you envision a typical farm or farm's fields, et cetera, we now look at?  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:15):**  How would they look and where would they sell to?  
**[0:41:18-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:18):**  Are we operating with the assumption that they're all going to be big farms?  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:21):**  No, so small.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:22):**  I would add small farms to that.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:23):**  I'm taking the quote a bit and changing it a bit, but how would the agricultural landscape  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:27):**  look like 2030 if we have embraced a lot of this quality focus and taste focus?  
**[0:41:32-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:32):**  Yeah, I would unpause at the first half of that question, which has to do with big ag  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:35):**  and just like leave that off the question.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:37):**  But what could things look like in 10 years?  
**[0:41:39-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:39):**  Well, I think one of my pet sort of projects or visions or things is I say, occupy the  
**[0:41:47-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:47):**  land.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:48):**  I don't think we want to have multi-thousand acre farms, multi-hundred acre farms.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:53):**  I think we want to have humans in relationship with land and culture.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:41:59):**  I think that's where we belong.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:00):**  I think we're foundationally animals and we belong in nature.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:04):**  And all this talk about how there's going to be 70% of the world's population living  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:08):**  in cities in 2050 or whatever.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:12):**  People have gotten to see over the past year how vulnerable those ecosystems are.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:17):**  And what I want to see and what I'm going to be putting some serious energy into is  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:21):**  that process of training and land access, land tenure.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:26):**  I think we can do a better job in polycultures at human scale from a nutritional standpoint  
**[0:42:33-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:33):**  and from a dollars per acre standpoint, as is shown by smallholders globally, even still.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:40):**  And I think cultural revitalization is the order of the day.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:44):**  I think that there's this thing called the Jeffersonian ethic, which take Jefferson out  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:48):**  of it if you want to.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:49):**  But the concept is basically that when people are independent and self-sufficient on land,  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:42:56):**  they make different decisions than when they're cogs in the corporate wheel.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:43:01):**  And so for me, the regenerative thing is like, okay, that's one piece of the puzzle, but  
**[0:43:06-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:43:06):**  it's the broader social cultural revitalization that I'm looking for.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:43:10):**  And I see the opportunity to be regreening significant parts of the planet that are brown.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:43:16):**  And a lot of people have moved into the cities because the land is not in a place where it  
**[0:43:19-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:43:19):**  can support them.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:43:21):**  But we've got models globally of how those lands could be much more fecund than they  
**[0:43:26-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:43:26):**  are now.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:43:27):**  I think it's a perfect answer to.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:43:28):**  And I want to thank you all so much for your questions.

**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-dan-kittredge/#t=0:47:17):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture

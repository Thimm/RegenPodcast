### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2017-06-22)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:14):**  You're going to listen to an interview with Renske Linde, founder and managing director  of FS6, to work on the transition to food system 6.  We're going to talk about the whole food system, not just the agriculture part, the production  
**[0:00:26-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:26):**  part, the soil health that we've covered so many times, but actually the whole system  that's on top of that and the giant disruptions that are happening in this space from workers'  health, distribution, traceability, but also the need of blended capital to come and support  
**[0:00:40-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:40):**  these early disruptors and make sure they reach the impact they need.  Enjoy.  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:51-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:51):**  the planet mattered.  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work, to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:02-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:02):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:13-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:13):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:25):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:36):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more  depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:50-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:50):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  support me and make this happen.  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:02):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  Enjoy.  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:12):**  I'm Koon van Seyn, your host.  And in the podcast today, we have Renske Linde, impact investor, co-founder and managing director  of Food System 6, enabling the best entrepreneurs to revolutionize the way we produce and distribute  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:24):**  food globally.  And of course, we're going to ask the obvious question if it has to do a lot with insects,  but probably doesn't.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:30):**  And welcome Renske.  Thank you, Val.  Thank you.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:33):**  It's so nice to hear my name pronounced correctly.  I'm trying, I'm trying.  So just to get before we dive into the personal questions, your impact investing, etc.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:42):**  Food System 6, it has a bit to do with insects as they are part of the future food system,  but it's not a project focused only on insects, right?  That's right.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:53):**  Exactly.  Yes, we do have a team, Tiny Farms that we worked with in our last cohort and that's  in our portfolio, that is working to develop the technology to scale insect protein production,  
**[0:03:05-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:05):**  primarily focused on becoming cost competitive with animal feed as a substitute for animal  feed.  So not necessarily going to market as a new sexy cricket item, but supplying some of that  
**[0:03:18-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:18):**  just to help them continue to scale.  And can you tell us a bit more about Food System 6 in general, because it's much more  than just helping insect companies?  
**[0:03:28-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:28):**  Yes, definitely.  And I'll start by saying that we tend to call our organization FS6, so the accelerator and  nonprofit think tank that I founded, we call FS6.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:41):**  And then we talk about Food System 6 in the more general terms, in terms of what we are  trying to support the creation of and the acceleration towards a food system.  So talk about the fact that humanity has transitioned through five different food systems and different  
**[0:03:57-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:57):**  iterations and has actually actively designed those systems to meet specific objectives.  And so I'll fast forward a little bit to talk about Food System 5, which is the industrialized  food system that we are currently experiencing.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:12):**  We're certainly at the tipping point in terms of a transition to another food system.  And there's a lot that we can say about why that's happening, and much of which you have  focused on in your podcast in terms of a focus on more sustainable production methods and  
**[0:04:27-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:27):**  regenerative methods.  But it is also one that we believe will be designed for a more integrated sense of health  across the environment and physical health and social health.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:40):**  So that's the system that we see being actively redesigned.  At the moment, there's a lot of signs pointing to that we are at that at a transition point,  which is exciting for me.  
**[0:04:51-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:51):**  So that's how we describe the vision that we hold for the food system itself as Food  System 6.  And then FS6 is the organization that we founded to help support entrepreneurs that are driving  
**[0:05:03-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:03):**  towards that kind of change and that impact in the system.  Great to hear that really transitioning from one food system to the next, we've only done  a few times in history and it's very exciting to be part of the next one.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:16):**  If you look at your personal story, how you've been working in food and agriculture and policy  for quite some time, what led you into that?  And was there one moment or was it a journey where you got so excited about food that you  
**[0:05:30-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:30):**  wanted to spend your professional career in that?  That's a great question.  And of course, there's an intimate and deep connection between the personal and the professional.  
**[0:05:40-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:40):**  So I have been very interested in the relationship between food, food production, food distribution.  Since I was a child, I grew up the daughter of immigrant parents who relied on many different  forms of food assistance to make ends meet and so have a very deep and personal connection  
**[0:06:00-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:00):**  to equity within the food system.  And then went on to build a career in the social sector at a variety of different points.  Really my focus was around how we could transform the food system and create impact for as many  
**[0:06:15-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:15):**  people as possible.  So that path definitely led me down policy, the policy route, and spent a number of years  working on international trade policy on behalf of small-scale sustainable farmers around  
**[0:06:27-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:27):**  the world.  I have also built direct markets for farmers at the very early days of the recognition  here in the States that we needed to think about supporting our local and regional food  
**[0:06:40-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:40):**  sheds.  And then I've worked on food access more broadly where I worked on food stamps and school meals.  And so it has been a very rich and incredibly rewarding career in the nonprofit sector.  
**[0:06:52-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:52):**  And I think that there's an absolutely critical role that nonprofit organizations play in  terms of raising awareness.  And in this case about the need to think differently about how we grow, produce, and distribute  
**[0:07:06-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:06):**  food.  And I think that it has always been a question for me in terms of how the raising of awareness  and education can actually meet up with solutions at scale.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:21):**  So that's something that I have spent a lot of time thinking about over the course of  the last 20 years of my career.  And it's certainly what basically got me to the point at which I was understanding that  
**[0:07:32-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:32):**  there was an opportunity to support innovators and entrepreneurs who were coming to the marketplace  with innovative solutions that really could scale and be very transformative around the  issues that I have worked towards for so long.  
**[0:07:48-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:48):**  So it was definitely a journey and there were certainly moments in that journey where the  power of innovation and entrepreneurship was made apparent to me.  So one example is I worked at the food bank in San Francisco and we were trying to improve  
**[0:08:05-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:05):**  the quality of school meals that our pantry clients were receiving.  And we ultimately granted a contract to a company based here in Oakland, California  called Revolution Foods.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:15):**  So I'm not sure if that's come across your desk.  Yeah, definitely.  So again, for me, it was a big eye-opener in terms of the potential that entrepreneurs  
**[0:08:29-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:29):**  can play in really tackling some of the most thorny issues related to the food system that  I've been working on for so long.  So that led me to doing a fellowship at Berkeley for the Food Institute where I was examining  
**[0:08:44-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:44):**  the opportunity for the social sector to influence and inform what was then the very early days  of private sector capital coming into the space.  And that was also my introduction to the emergence of the impact investing industry.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:59):**  So those three threads came together and through the course of the work I did for that fellowship,  I met a very unique venture capitalist and he has gone on to become the co-founder of  FS6.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:12):**  And from that story, it seems that the scale you were looking for really drew you eventually  to the entrepreneur side and innovator side.  Was that what you were looking for?  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:25):**  Maybe sometimes missing in the policy side?  Definitely, definitely.  Yes.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:29):**  And, you know, we can talk a little bit more about that in terms of just the how FS6 got  off the ground because it actually really was a very cross sector and collaborative  approach to answering some of these questions in the food system that created FS6 and it  
**[0:09:46-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:46):**  continues to inform how we engage with a number of different stakeholders all throughout the  value chain and also in many different sectors.  So I can share a little bit more about that.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:57):**  But yes, I mean, absolutely.  The potential that entrepreneurs have to, you know, really not only incredibly, you  know, just really disrupt and create entirely new business models, but being able to scale  
**[0:10:13-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:13):**  their impact and their mission and their focus as they do.  And they're kind of just the passion and the persistence and all of that is, and the private  sector sensibility is certainly something that I felt I was missing in the nonprofit  
**[0:10:28-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:28):**  sector.  But again, also, you know, we are as an organization, we are a nonprofit and we think it's really  important that we are because we do maintain a focus on impact and we do have a bigger  
**[0:10:37-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:37):**  picture mission beyond the work that we do to support the entrepreneurs.  We also think there's so much that can be learned from the teams that are really in  the trenches trying to solve for some of these issues that we can then, you know, leverage  
**[0:10:50-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:50):**  that to help inform and influence other stakeholders in the system.  So yes, it definitely, it's also, it's a lot of fun to work with entrepreneurs.  They're, you know, incredibly, again, passionate and, you know, really focused on, you know,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:07):**  solving for some incredibly complex issues.  And, you know, so we've built a program that we believe can help support them in the many  ways in which entrepreneurs need help.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:18):**  It's not easy to build something from nothing.  I definitely don't need to tell you that or any of your listeners that, but it's especially  more complicated, especially more complex in the food system given how interrelated  
**[0:11:31-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:31):**  all the different parts of the value chain are and also the dynamic interplay between  sectors within the food system.  And not to mention the fact that it is a living system and so that adds an additional layer  
**[0:11:45-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:45):**  of complexity.  And so all of that really informs the way in which we support our teams as far as capital  is concerned, the right form of capital, the right time, as well as just making sure that  
**[0:11:57-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:57):**  we are connecting them with those people who are in a position to help support their growth  from any number of dimensions and angles.  And if you look at your first cohort, which has finished a while ago, and you're actually  
**[0:12:12-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:12):**  going to recruit the new one and select the new ones, which will start in August.  Can you name one example of the first cohort that really, like you mentioned before, disrupted  or is going to disrupt or hopefully disrupt and really surprised you as a partner in Food  
**[0:12:29-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:29):**  System 6?  What was taking you by surprise during this program?  Okay, so I heard a couple of questions in there and I think that as we like to say,  
**[0:12:40-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:40):**  it's like asking a parent who their favorite child is.  And of course that's an impossible task.  They're all equal, I know.  
**[0:12:48-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:48):**  Exactly.  But you know, we did, we were very intentional in terms of the teams that we chose, not only  because they represented different aspects of the value chain, different dimensions of  
**[0:13:02-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:02):**  impact that we saw some really strong interrelationships between, but also because they were approaching  the set of problems within the food system and very unique in different ways.  And that was really important to us because we don't believe that Food System 6 will be  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:20):**  defined by one particular path.  And so you opened this conversation by saying, you know, we're more than insects.  And that's absolutely true.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:28):**  We see a critical role for the development of an alternative to livestock feed.  There's no question that that is an absolutely critical issue.  It is as important to develop tools and technologies that can help support a transition from current  
**[0:13:43-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:43):**  production practices to ones that are more regenerative in nature.  And so, you know, when we look at a team like Pasture Map, which is developing a grazing  software management platform for ranchers, like it is, it looks so different than, you  
**[0:13:57-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:57):**  know, than the insect development.  And it looks similarly different from a heritage poultry company and you know what it means  to build production in a whole new category of poultry.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:07):**  You know, not sure if you know the statistics around at least domestic poultry production,  but you know, over 95% are the same genetic breed.  And there's a lot of health implications to that lack of genetic diversity.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:19):**  And risks.  Absolutely.  And a lot of, you know, production issues related to that type of concentration in production  
**[0:14:28-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:28):**  in across many different forms of animal production, not just poultry.  So you know, I think in terms of the power and the potential, I think, you know, we believe  that each of the teams is uniquely and individually quite poised to affect their particular segment  
**[0:14:45-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:45):**  and their particular domain.  I think in terms of what surprised us, you know, I don't know that I would say there  were surprises as much as just really deep and important learnings in terms of, I think,  
**[0:14:57-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:57):**  the capital landscape is, you know, and this is certainly a subject of this call, but in  terms of how capital can and different forms of capital, and I'll be explicit that in this  case I'm talking about financial capital, can best be leveraged in order to support  
**[0:15:13-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:13):**  the kind of impact that we're seeking in the food system.  So you know, and there's a lot of different examples that are emerging in terms of what  this kind of blended term sheet might look like.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:24):**  But I think, you know, there's been some conversation around the need for more patient capital in  the food system, and lots of good reasons why, you know, we believe that that's entirely  aligned with our approach as well.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:36):**  But even more than that, we're very interested in the dialogue and in, you know, seeding  conversations around the role that philanthropic capital can play in, you know, helping prove  out some of these really innovative market-based solutions that are going to have a very significant  
**[0:15:52-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:52):**  social or environmental or human health impact.  And so that's, you know, that again, it's not as much of a surprise as much as it is  just, you know, wanting to really dig in and expose where the opportunities are, and of  
**[0:16:06-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:06):**  course where some of the challenges are, and thinking about this kind of capital stack,  and there's, you know, a few different words that are being used in this landscape.  So again, not a surprise as much as just something that, you know, we know is a very live and  
**[0:16:18-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:18):**  very important area for impact-focused entrepreneurs in food to be thinking about.  And so we're doing our best to kind of support the conversations and the dialogue and then  obviously ultimately the action around that.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:32):**  So I'd say that that's definitely something where, you know, I don't think it's keeping  us up at night as much as it is, you know, just something that we want to be able to  support the evolution of that dialogue.  
**[0:16:46-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:46):**  And if you look at your first cohort and the second one you're planning now, what's going  to be different in terms of, what's going to be different in general?  Well, certainly on our side, we are, you know, we do our, obviously we do incredibly intense  
**[0:17:02-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:02):**  work one-on-one with our teams when we're in our four-month program, but the work doesn't  stop there.  And so we're continuing to support the teams that we supported in our last cohort.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:13):**  And so, you know, as we, you know, as issues crop up, which they do when you're building  something, you know, just making sure that we're really available and accessible to those  teams, we'll sort of add that onto being in cohort with the next set of teams that we  
**[0:17:30-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:30):**  work with.  You know, there are a few parts of our program that we, you know, we'll certainly iterate  on based on feedback from the teams.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:37):**  We have a heavy emphasis on story and we will continue to elevate that in terms of its importance.  And again, just based on our impact objectives as an organization, sharing the stories of  what these teams are experiencing as they're growing and building is just so critical for  
**[0:17:55-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:55):**  advancing the field in general.  So we will definitely continue that focus.  In terms of the teams that we work with, we're excited to continue to expand on the diversity  
**[0:18:06-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:06):**  of entrepreneurs, different regions.  We supported a team based in Hawaii and one based in Washington, DC last time, but we're  excited about expanding the regional scope of our work.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:20):**  There's a lot of really interesting place-based activity happening and ecosystems developing  on the ground.  I'm most familiar with the ones here domestically, but know that this is happening in China and  
**[0:18:30-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:30):**  you know, many other parts of the world.  So, you know, thinking about the best way that FS6 as an organization and a platform  is poised to help support some of that place-based activity would be really exciting for us.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:43):**  We are, you know, very interested in supporting the teams that are actively addressing what  we call maybe some of the more overlooked parts of the food system where we see some  really critical opportunity for transformative impact.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:57):**  And so some of that has to do with indigenous and native land for food production as well  as continuing to support efforts that are thinking about labor all throughout the value  chain, both on the farm and all throughout food service and retail.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:14):**  Which is very often overlooked.  Exactly.  And I think, as I trace back to the beginning of this conversation and my background and  
**[0:19:23-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:23):**  the work that I've done, part of what I like to say to more traditional investors is, look,  you know, the issues that the nonprofit sector are working on, I mean, we not only have sort  of a moral and an ethical obligation to support that work because it is so critical, but also  
**[0:19:40-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:40):**  in the food system, the issues and topics that the social sector is working on will,  you know, inevitably, from my perspective, become business model opportunities of the  not too distant future.  
**[0:19:52-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:52):**  And I think, you know, you can look back at how the good food movement, broadly speaking,  you know, was instigated and much of that came from the social sector, you know, raising  awareness and doing the things that, you know, the organizations I worked with and many,  
**[0:20:05-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:05):**  many others like them were doing.  And so, you know, I think there's a, there's sort of a, there's certainly a profit and  purpose dual motive in terms of our interest in supporting nonprofit organizations as well.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:19):**  And when you look at the workers' health, let's call it a bit broadly, what kind of  models do you see there in terms of disruption, in terms of, I can imagine a lot of traceability  and proven that you're paying well and fairly, etc., but in terms of opportunities, what  
**[0:20:37-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:37):**  do you see, what comes across your desk?  Yeah, that's a good, that's a really good question.  And definitely, you know, with the, with the advent and the emerging ability to track and  
**[0:20:47-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:47):**  trace and certification systems, I think there's, there's certainly some good precedent that  can be built upon.  But I also see some significant opportunities for disruption of some of those models that  
**[0:20:58-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:58):**  have, you know, done a great job, again, in terms of raising awareness, but the implementation  and, you know, the transparency of the programs isn't always what, you know, certainly what  consumers are looking for necessarily.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:10):**  I think there are going to be a lot of opportunities on information exchange.  So I think that is, that is an area where I'm seeing, you know, I've seen three or four  different platforms using and leveraging, you know, information and information systems  
**[0:21:27-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:27):**  to aggregate experiences on the farm that, you know, are going to end up being incredibly  useful from just a data perspective.  And then, you know, again, the extent to which those are, are capable of connecting into  
**[0:21:42-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:42):**  tracking and tracing and those other systems that are being, you know, created to identify  attributes as they move through the system.  I think there's some extraordinary opportunity there.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:54):**  So we're definitely excited about supporting a team in that space, for sure.  Very, very interesting.  And in terms of, let's have a look at investments of your personal investments.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:09):**  Do you remember your first sustainable food system or regenerative agriculture investment?  And if so, which one was it?  Sure.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:19):**  Yeah, I do.  At least to be clear from a financial investment perspective.  Because I think that, you know, there's many different ways in which you can think about  
**[0:22:29-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:29):**  investing time, resources, knowledge, and you know, capital across many dimensions.  But yes.  Yeah, no, definitely financial.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:36):**  I was an early stage investor in Imperfect Produce, which is a Bay Area based company  that has developed a distribution system for what they call ugly produce or imperfect produce.  So food that would otherwise go to waste because it isn't up to an aesthetic code.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:56):**  And they've built and developed a distribution system for that food and they're doing extremely  well.  And it's an amazing team.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:03):**  And a team that, you know, is very near and dear to my own heart because they got their  start in the nonprofit sector, building a national network of food recovery organizations  on college campuses and identified a business model opportunity to brand Imperfect Produce.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:20):**  And they've done an incredible job and they continue to grow.  And it's been very exciting to be at least a small part of their growth and their trajectory.  Fascinating.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:31):**  And if you look at the FS6, the upcoming cohort, what are you looking for?  If people are listening, they're wondering, but does my company or does a company I know  fit into this cohort?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:45):**  What are the characteristics, criteria, etc. to be starting in August?  Yeah, that's a good question.  And I will say it can be, it's not a simple answer, which I'm sure you won't be surprised  
**[0:23:56-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:56):**  to hear when you're talking about something as complex as the food system.  There are a lot of different ways in which you could consider, you know, how you may  want to affect change.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:06):**  So the first thing I would say is, you know, if there are entrepreneurs that are listening  to this that are thinking about, you know, having an impact and wanting to create an  impact on, you know, some of the critical issues related to sustainability and food  
**[0:24:19-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:19):**  production through a variety of means, or have a business product or service that is,  you know, thinking about what the health outcomes are as related to the food system, reach out.  It's you know, we are certainly excited about hearing ideas and concepts and research.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:40):**  Those are, you know, those are all really important for us to, you know, continue to  do our jobs well in terms of informing the broader ecosystem about what's going on out  there.  
**[0:24:49-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:49):**  So I, we are best suited to lend support through our program to teens who are past the kind  of idea or concept stage, and who have some product market fit, some traction in the marketplace  and tend to be, and again, there are certainly notable exceptions here, but tend to be pre-institutional  
**[0:25:12-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:12):**  capital.  That is where I think we are best suited to lend support.  And of course, because we support nonprofit organizations, if that's the designation,  
**[0:25:20-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:20):**  we're excited to hear about your work.  You know, again, there are certainly exceptions there because we're, for example, talking  to a team that has raised significantly more capital, but is very interested in expanding  
**[0:25:33-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:33):**  their impact focus and in really thinking through some of the issues related to their  supply chain.  So, you know, there are certainly exceptions in terms of, you know, the stage of a company.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:45):**  So, you know, it's never, it's never too early to introduce yourself.  We'd love to hear, you know, what you're working on.  But generally speaking, it's, it's within that very early stage.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:54):**  And if you look at, let's say the last year and you've been working with these teams of  the first cohort, you've been working with a lot of investors on the other side and you  already touched upon it a bit earlier, but I would like to go a bit deeper into that  
**[0:26:07-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:07):**  on blended capital.  What's could the role be or stacked capital, what's the role of the different layers and  what do you see in these disruptors that they need and what maybe the market isn't offering  
**[0:26:20-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:20):**  yet, but that you're hopefully figuring out in the next few cohorts how to use different  types of capitals and why is it so important to, financial capital in this case, so important  to use different ones to actually get these disruptors to scale and the impact that they  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:36):**  should have?  Yeah, that's a really good question.  And it's certainly something that we're spending a lot of time, like I mentioned, developing  
**[0:26:42-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:42):**  some content around and we'll be doing both a webinar as well as some white papers on  the topic based on, again, some of the case studies that we're seeing in the space as  well as some of our teams that are working through these issues.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:57):**  So it's a very active and new kind of area.  And so from my perspective, I think the opportunity that these teams represent from an impact  standpoint and the requirement of more patient capital to help them get to scale, prove their  
**[0:27:18-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:27:18):**  concept, I mean, given the fact that there is the complexity of the living production  system sitting underneath their tool or technology or business model or program, the need for  just longer lead times to be able to actually prove things out, I think there's a really  
**[0:27:34-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:27:34):**  critical role for philanthropic capital to play in that space because what that's also  doing is creating the opportunity for us to generate learnings, which are going to absolutely  help advance the field and other types of businesses that are coming into the space.  
**[0:27:51-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:27:51):**  So I think there is not only an opportunity for that form of capital to help teams get  to a point at which they're able to bring on other types of investors, but also it is  a very, very powerful way to build the field and to continue to build the capacity of other  
**[0:28:12-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:28:12):**  types of stakeholders and entrepreneurs that are coming into the space.  So again, there are a few case studies in terms of how this is playing out.  I think it's a really dynamic space and place for family offices and foundations that are  
**[0:28:30-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:28:30):**  interested in making direct investments into teams because there's a lot to learn through  that process of being a mission-oriented, impact-focused investor at the table with  other types of investors and how does that work and how can it work.  
**[0:28:49-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:28:49):**  These are all very important questions in terms of thinking about the future of these  kinds of businesses.  We have certain types of entities and corporations and legal structures that are cropping up  
**[0:29:03-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:03):**  to help further define this space and further create opportunities to think about how we  blend profit and purpose.  But when it comes to thinking differently about what the term sheet looks like and who's  
**[0:29:16-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:16):**  at the table, I think there's a lot of opportunity to explore in that.  So I definitely know that that's something that we're going to remain very actively engaged  in and think we have the ability to bring a lot of the philanthropic community that  
**[0:29:33-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:33):**  has been focused on some very critical food system issues to the table to really help  influence and inform how these teams grow too.  I think that's the other significant opportunity that we have when we think about the resources  
**[0:29:49-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:49):**  and the knowledge that come with philanthropic capital that's been so active in the space.  I think it's a whole different way of thinking about affecting change.  A lot of the philanthropic community's focus has been on field building and awareness raising  
**[0:30:06-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:06):**  and on changing what might be construed as bad corporate habits and that all absolutely  needs to continue.  But I would add to that that there's an opportunity to also help influence what the next generation  
**[0:30:20-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:20):**  of food companies and agriculture companies is going to look like and being able to pivot  and adjust how we think about this.  Again, I think it's a really live opportunity and can really help carve out this future  
**[0:30:39-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:39):**  food system in a very unique and interesting way.  Do you have an example of maybe your first cohort or anything else in your network where  these different types of capital have come together and supported a very disruptive team?  
**[0:30:57-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:57):**  Yeah.  Again, this is new, but there are some examples in the space.  Revolution Foods, which is a company that I actually referenced as being part of my  
**[0:31:08-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:08):**  own journey, got its start through a variety of different forms of funding, including some  funding from the Kellogg Foundation and RSF Social Finance, as well as some city funding  from the city of Oakland.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:22):**  There's definitely a blended approach there at the early stages of their company.  Most recently, there's a company called Appeal, which is a food waste and food preservation  company primarily coming to market through developing countries that got its start from  
**[0:31:42-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:42):**  grant funding from the Gates Foundation and most recently received a round of venture  capital financing from DBL Investors.  There is a soil health company called Midwestern Bioag that recently received an investment  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:54):**  from the McKnight Foundation.  We're definitely starting.  At the end, there are a few others in the space.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:00):**  As I mentioned, we're actively supporting some of our teams right now in this landscape.  Again, it's emergent to some degree, but again, very exciting opportunity to really think  differently about how we scale entrepreneurs.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:19):**  I would like to end this podcast with two questions actually.  Let's say, I mean, hopefully they're all smart in the audience, but there are a number of  smart impact investors in the audience and also a number of smart foundations and nonprofits  
**[0:32:34-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:34):**  that have been active in maybe the more field building and awareness before.  What would you say to, the answer can be different for the two groups that want to become active  in the new food system space, the food system six in the transition.  
**[0:32:49-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:49):**  What would you tell these two different groups that for you would be the best way to get  active in this space?  Can you remind me again of the two different?  
**[0:33:00-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:00):**  Yes, you are smart impact investors and the nonprofit side, the foundations that have  been maybe more on the field building side, maybe more on the awareness side, but are  interested obviously in these very disruptive teams, but they don't really know where to  
**[0:33:14-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:14):**  start.  Great.  As far as the impact investors are concerned, I think that there definitely needs to be  
**[0:33:22-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:22):**  a level of understanding about just how complex the system is.  I think that looking to some of the well-established NGOs in the space, depending on what your  area of interest is in terms of the supply chain.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:40):**  For example, I think we can't think about the future of food production without looking  at the work that the Land Institute has done on perennial grain production.  I think we can't think about other, for example, seafood and where the opportunities are to  
**[0:33:59-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:59):**  invest in regenerative ocean economies without looking at the likes of some of the work that  the Moore Foundation has supported.  I think it's really important for there to be just a good context setting and an understanding  
**[0:34:13-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:13):**  of where we are in this moment of time.  I point to some of those organizations.  There are many others like them, Stone Barns, the Center for Land-based Living here in Davis.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:23):**  There are some really important leaders, thought leaders, and researchers and a knowledge base  that I think really needs to be accessed while identifying investment, while looking at or  examining investment opportunities in the space.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:37):**  I think those two have to go hand in hand.  On the other side, I think from the foundation perspective, I think it's about thinking that  there is that the opportunity exists to create an impact in a new and different way that  
**[0:34:55-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:55):**  is really, really influential and really impactful to help shape the journeys of these innovators  and these disruptors.  I think there's a little bit of a mindset shift that needs to happen in order to support  
**[0:35:09-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:09):**  that, which is to say, if you choose to make an investment in a company, yes, you are choosing  to invest in the success of that company, but the importance of scaling impact along  with that company and the role that a foundation and all of that knowledge capital can play  
**[0:35:27-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:27):**  in helping do that in the right way, I think it's just such a critical opportunity.  So I think that's how I would probably characterize my advice for those two different groups of  stakeholders.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:41):**  I want to thank you so much, Renske, for this interview and to take your time.  And of course, I will link below as many of the parties you mentioned, but also the link  to apply for the new cohort for anybody that wants to know more and see if they fit.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:58):**  And I will be sure to check in with the new cohort and very interesting companies.  I mean, it was a very interesting one, the first cohort, and I'm sure the second one  will be even more interesting.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:36:08):**  So be sure to be checking in and see how they are doing and how SF6 is doing in the future.  Fantastic.  Thank you so much.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:36:17):**  You just listened to an interview with Renske Linde.  We talked about blended capital and about the whole food system.  So not just the agriculture and the production part, but about the disruptions that are needed  
**[0:36:26-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:36:26):**  to really make this a food system that works for all.

**[0:37:33-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:37:33):**  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:37:44-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:37:44):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:37:54-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:37:54):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:38:01):**  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  
**[0:38:05-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:38:05):**  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  You the soil builders and investors in the space, the soil builders, people working in  
**[0:38:13-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:38:13):**  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  designers, holistic management consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:38:26):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:38:40):**  et cetera.  Is this course free?  No.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:38:43):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:38:55):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:04):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:14):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:39:29-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:29):**  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:39):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:47):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:55):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

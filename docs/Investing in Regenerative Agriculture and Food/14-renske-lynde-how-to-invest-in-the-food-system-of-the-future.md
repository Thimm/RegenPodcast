**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:14):**  You're going to listen to an interview with Renske Linde, founder and managing director  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:18):**  of FS6, to work on the transition to food system 6.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:22):**  We're going to talk about the whole food system, not just the agriculture part, the production  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:26):**  part, the soil health that we've covered so many times, but actually the whole system  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:30):**  that's on top of that and the giant disruptions that are happening in this space from workers'  
**[0:00:34-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:34):**  health, distribution, traceability, but also the need of blended capital to come and support  
**[0:00:40-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:40):**  these early disruptors and make sure they reach the impact they need.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:43):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:44):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:51-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:51):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:52):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:00:57):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work, to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:02):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:06):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:09):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:13-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:13):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:15):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:20):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:25):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:29):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:32):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:36):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:41):**  depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:45):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:50):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:55):**  support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:01:57):**  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:02):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:05):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:06):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:12):**  I'm Koon van Seyn, your host.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:13):**  And in the podcast today, we have Renske Linde, impact investor, co-founder and managing director  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:19):**  of Food System 6, enabling the best entrepreneurs to revolutionize the way we produce and distribute  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:24):**  food globally.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:25):**  And of course, we're going to ask the obvious question if it has to do a lot with insects,  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:29):**  but probably doesn't.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:30):**  And welcome Renske.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:31):**  Thank you, Val.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:32):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:33):**  It's so nice to hear my name pronounced correctly.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:35):**  I'm trying, I'm trying.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:37):**  So just to get before we dive into the personal questions, your impact investing, etc.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:42):**  Food System 6, it has a bit to do with insects as they are part of the future food system,  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:47):**  but it's not a project focused only on insects, right?  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:52):**  That's right.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:53):**  Exactly.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:54):**  Yes, we do have a team, Tiny Farms that we worked with in our last cohort and that's  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:02:59):**  in our portfolio, that is working to develop the technology to scale insect protein production,  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:05):**  primarily focused on becoming cost competitive with animal feed as a substitute for animal  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:11):**  feed.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:12):**  So not necessarily going to market as a new sexy cricket item, but supplying some of that  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:18):**  just to help them continue to scale.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:20):**  And can you tell us a bit more about Food System 6 in general, because it's much more  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:25):**  than just helping insect companies?  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:28):**  Yes, definitely.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:31):**  And I'll start by saying that we tend to call our organization FS6, so the accelerator and  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:37):**  nonprofit think tank that I founded, we call FS6.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:41):**  And then we talk about Food System 6 in the more general terms, in terms of what we are  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:47):**  trying to support the creation of and the acceleration towards a food system.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:51):**  So talk about the fact that humanity has transitioned through five different food systems and different  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:03:57):**  iterations and has actually actively designed those systems to meet specific objectives.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:03):**  And so I'll fast forward a little bit to talk about Food System 5, which is the industrialized  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:09):**  food system that we are currently experiencing.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:12):**  We're certainly at the tipping point in terms of a transition to another food system.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:18):**  And there's a lot that we can say about why that's happening, and much of which you have  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:22):**  focused on in your podcast in terms of a focus on more sustainable production methods and  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:27):**  regenerative methods.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:28):**  But it is also one that we believe will be designed for a more integrated sense of health  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:34):**  across the environment and physical health and social health.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:40):**  So that's the system that we see being actively redesigned.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:45):**  At the moment, there's a lot of signs pointing to that we are at that at a transition point,  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:49):**  which is exciting for me.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:51):**  So that's how we describe the vision that we hold for the food system itself as Food  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:57):**  System 6.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:04:58):**  And then FS6 is the organization that we founded to help support entrepreneurs that are driving  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:03):**  towards that kind of change and that impact in the system.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:07):**  Great to hear that really transitioning from one food system to the next, we've only done  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:12):**  a few times in history and it's very exciting to be part of the next one.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:16):**  If you look at your personal story, how you've been working in food and agriculture and policy  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:23):**  for quite some time, what led you into that?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:26):**  And was there one moment or was it a journey where you got so excited about food that you  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:30):**  wanted to spend your professional career in that?  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:34):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:35):**  And of course, there's an intimate and deep connection between the personal and the professional.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:40):**  So I have been very interested in the relationship between food, food production, food distribution.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:48):**  Since I was a child, I grew up the daughter of immigrant parents who relied on many different  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:05:54):**  forms of food assistance to make ends meet and so have a very deep and personal connection  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:00):**  to equity within the food system.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:03):**  And then went on to build a career in the social sector at a variety of different points.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:09):**  Really my focus was around how we could transform the food system and create impact for as many  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:15):**  people as possible.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:16):**  So that path definitely led me down policy, the policy route, and spent a number of years  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:22):**  working on international trade policy on behalf of small-scale sustainable farmers around  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:27):**  the world.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:28):**  I have also built direct markets for farmers at the very early days of the recognition  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:34):**  here in the States that we needed to think about supporting our local and regional food  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:40):**  sheds.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:41):**  And then I've worked on food access more broadly where I worked on food stamps and school meals.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:46):**  And so it has been a very rich and incredibly rewarding career in the nonprofit sector.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:52):**  And I think that there's an absolutely critical role that nonprofit organizations play in  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:06:58):**  terms of raising awareness.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:01):**  And in this case about the need to think differently about how we grow, produce, and distribute  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:06):**  food.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:07):**  And I think that it has always been a question for me in terms of how the raising of awareness  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:16):**  and education can actually meet up with solutions at scale.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:21):**  So that's something that I have spent a lot of time thinking about over the course of  
**[0:07:25-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:25):**  the last 20 years of my career.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:27):**  And it's certainly what basically got me to the point at which I was understanding that  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:32):**  there was an opportunity to support innovators and entrepreneurs who were coming to the marketplace  
**[0:07:37-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:37):**  with innovative solutions that really could scale and be very transformative around the  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:44):**  issues that I have worked towards for so long.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:48):**  So it was definitely a journey and there were certainly moments in that journey where the  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:07:55):**  power of innovation and entrepreneurship was made apparent to me.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:00):**  So one example is I worked at the food bank in San Francisco and we were trying to improve  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:05):**  the quality of school meals that our pantry clients were receiving.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:09):**  And we ultimately granted a contract to a company based here in Oakland, California  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:14):**  called Revolution Foods.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:15):**  So I'm not sure if that's come across your desk.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:19):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:21):**  So again, for me, it was a big eye-opener in terms of the potential that entrepreneurs  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:29):**  can play in really tackling some of the most thorny issues related to the food system that  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:36):**  I've been working on for so long.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:37):**  So that led me to doing a fellowship at Berkeley for the Food Institute where I was examining  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:44):**  the opportunity for the social sector to influence and inform what was then the very early days  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:51):**  of private sector capital coming into the space.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:54):**  And that was also my introduction to the emergence of the impact investing industry.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:08:59):**  So those three threads came together and through the course of the work I did for that fellowship,  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:05):**  I met a very unique venture capitalist and he has gone on to become the co-founder of  
**[0:09:11-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:11):**  FS6.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:12):**  And from that story, it seems that the scale you were looking for really drew you eventually  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:20):**  to the entrepreneur side and innovator side.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:24):**  Was that what you were looking for?  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:25):**  Maybe sometimes missing in the policy side?  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:27):**  Definitely, definitely.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:28):**  Yes.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:29):**  And, you know, we can talk a little bit more about that in terms of just the how FS6 got  
**[0:09:34-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:34):**  off the ground because it actually really was a very cross sector and collaborative  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:41):**  approach to answering some of these questions in the food system that created FS6 and it  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:46):**  continues to inform how we engage with a number of different stakeholders all throughout the  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:52):**  value chain and also in many different sectors.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:55):**  So I can share a little bit more about that.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:09:57):**  But yes, I mean, absolutely.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:00):**  The potential that entrepreneurs have to, you know, really not only incredibly, you  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:06):**  know, just really disrupt and create entirely new business models, but being able to scale  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:13):**  their impact and their mission and their focus as they do.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:16):**  And they're kind of just the passion and the persistence and all of that is, and the private  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:22):**  sector sensibility is certainly something that I felt I was missing in the nonprofit  
**[0:10:28-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:28):**  sector.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:29):**  But again, also, you know, we are as an organization, we are a nonprofit and we think it's really  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:32):**  important that we are because we do maintain a focus on impact and we do have a bigger  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:37):**  picture mission beyond the work that we do to support the entrepreneurs.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:41):**  We also think there's so much that can be learned from the teams that are really in  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:46):**  the trenches trying to solve for some of these issues that we can then, you know, leverage  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:50):**  that to help inform and influence other stakeholders in the system.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:10:54):**  So yes, it definitely, it's also, it's a lot of fun to work with entrepreneurs.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:00):**  They're, you know, incredibly, again, passionate and, you know, really focused on, you know,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:07):**  solving for some incredibly complex issues.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:10):**  And, you know, so we've built a program that we believe can help support them in the many  
**[0:11:15-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:15):**  ways in which entrepreneurs need help.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:18):**  It's not easy to build something from nothing.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:20):**  I definitely don't need to tell you that or any of your listeners that, but it's especially  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:25):**  more complicated, especially more complex in the food system given how interrelated  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:31):**  all the different parts of the value chain are and also the dynamic interplay between  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:36):**  sectors within the food system.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:39):**  And not to mention the fact that it is a living system and so that adds an additional layer  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:45):**  of complexity.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:47):**  And so all of that really informs the way in which we support our teams as far as capital  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:51):**  is concerned, the right form of capital, the right time, as well as just making sure that  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:11:57):**  we are connecting them with those people who are in a position to help support their growth  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:03):**  from any number of dimensions and angles.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:08):**  And if you look at your first cohort, which has finished a while ago, and you're actually  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:12):**  going to recruit the new one and select the new ones, which will start in August.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:18):**  Can you name one example of the first cohort that really, like you mentioned before, disrupted  
**[0:12:22-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:22):**  or is going to disrupt or hopefully disrupt and really surprised you as a partner in Food  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:29):**  System 6?  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:30):**  What was taking you by surprise during this program?  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:33):**  Okay, so I heard a couple of questions in there and I think that as we like to say,  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:40):**  it's like asking a parent who their favorite child is.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:43):**  And of course that's an impossible task.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:46):**  They're all equal, I know.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:48):**  Exactly.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:49):**  But you know, we did, we were very intentional in terms of the teams that we chose, not only  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:12:56):**  because they represented different aspects of the value chain, different dimensions of  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:02):**  impact that we saw some really strong interrelationships between, but also because they were approaching  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:09):**  the set of problems within the food system and very unique in different ways.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:15):**  And that was really important to us because we don't believe that Food System 6 will be  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:20):**  defined by one particular path.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:22):**  And so you opened this conversation by saying, you know, we're more than insects.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:27):**  And that's absolutely true.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:28):**  We see a critical role for the development of an alternative to livestock feed.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:34):**  There's no question that that is an absolutely critical issue.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:37):**  It is as important to develop tools and technologies that can help support a transition from current  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:43):**  production practices to ones that are more regenerative in nature.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:47):**  And so, you know, when we look at a team like Pasture Map, which is developing a grazing  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:51):**  software management platform for ranchers, like it is, it looks so different than, you  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:57):**  know, than the insect development.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:13:58):**  And it looks similarly different from a heritage poultry company and you know what it means  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:03):**  to build production in a whole new category of poultry.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:07):**  You know, not sure if you know the statistics around at least domestic poultry production,  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:11):**  but you know, over 95% are the same genetic breed.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:15):**  And there's a lot of health implications to that lack of genetic diversity.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:19):**  And risks.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:20):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:21):**  And a lot of, you know, production issues related to that type of concentration in production  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:28):**  in across many different forms of animal production, not just poultry.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:32):**  So you know, I think in terms of the power and the potential, I think, you know, we believe  
**[0:14:37-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:37):**  that each of the teams is uniquely and individually quite poised to affect their particular segment  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:45):**  and their particular domain.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:47):**  I think in terms of what surprised us, you know, I don't know that I would say there  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:52):**  were surprises as much as just really deep and important learnings in terms of, I think,  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:14:57):**  the capital landscape is, you know, and this is certainly a subject of this call, but in  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:01):**  terms of how capital can and different forms of capital, and I'll be explicit that in this  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:08):**  case I'm talking about financial capital, can best be leveraged in order to support  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:13):**  the kind of impact that we're seeking in the food system.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:15):**  So you know, and there's a lot of different examples that are emerging in terms of what  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:20):**  this kind of blended term sheet might look like.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:24):**  But I think, you know, there's been some conversation around the need for more patient capital in  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:29):**  the food system, and lots of good reasons why, you know, we believe that that's entirely  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:34):**  aligned with our approach as well.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:36):**  But even more than that, we're very interested in the dialogue and in, you know, seeding  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:41):**  conversations around the role that philanthropic capital can play in, you know, helping prove  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:46):**  out some of these really innovative market-based solutions that are going to have a very significant  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:52):**  social or environmental or human health impact.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:55):**  And so that's, you know, that again, it's not as much of a surprise as much as it is  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:15:59):**  just, you know, wanting to really dig in and expose where the opportunities are, and of  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:06):**  course where some of the challenges are, and thinking about this kind of capital stack,  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:10):**  and there's, you know, a few different words that are being used in this landscape.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:13):**  So again, not a surprise as much as just something that, you know, we know is a very live and  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:18):**  very important area for impact-focused entrepreneurs in food to be thinking about.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:24):**  And so we're doing our best to kind of support the conversations and the dialogue and then  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:30):**  obviously ultimately the action around that.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:32):**  So I'd say that that's definitely something where, you know, I don't think it's keeping  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:37):**  us up at night as much as it is, you know, just something that we want to be able to  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:43):**  support the evolution of that dialogue.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:46):**  And if you look at your first cohort and the second one you're planning now, what's going  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:51):**  to be different in terms of, what's going to be different in general?  
**[0:16:54-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:16:54):**  Well, certainly on our side, we are, you know, we do our, obviously we do incredibly intense  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:02):**  work one-on-one with our teams when we're in our four-month program, but the work doesn't  
**[0:17:07-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:07):**  stop there.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:09):**  And so we're continuing to support the teams that we supported in our last cohort.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:13):**  And so, you know, as we, you know, as issues crop up, which they do when you're building  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:19):**  something, you know, just making sure that we're really available and accessible to those  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:23):**  teams, we'll sort of add that onto being in cohort with the next set of teams that we  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:30):**  work with.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:31):**  You know, there are a few parts of our program that we, you know, we'll certainly iterate  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:35):**  on based on feedback from the teams.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:37):**  We have a heavy emphasis on story and we will continue to elevate that in terms of its importance.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:46):**  And again, just based on our impact objectives as an organization, sharing the stories of  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:50):**  what these teams are experiencing as they're growing and building is just so critical for  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:55):**  advancing the field in general.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:17:57):**  So we will definitely continue that focus.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:00):**  In terms of the teams that we work with, we're excited to continue to expand on the diversity  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:06):**  of entrepreneurs, different regions.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:09):**  We supported a team based in Hawaii and one based in Washington, DC last time, but we're  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:14):**  excited about expanding the regional scope of our work.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:20):**  There's a lot of really interesting place-based activity happening and ecosystems developing  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:25):**  on the ground.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:26):**  I'm most familiar with the ones here domestically, but know that this is happening in China and  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:30):**  you know, many other parts of the world.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:32):**  So, you know, thinking about the best way that FS6 as an organization and a platform  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:38):**  is poised to help support some of that place-based activity would be really exciting for us.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:43):**  We are, you know, very interested in supporting the teams that are actively addressing what  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:49):**  we call maybe some of the more overlooked parts of the food system where we see some  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:53):**  really critical opportunity for transformative impact.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:18:57):**  And so some of that has to do with indigenous and native land for food production as well  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:04):**  as continuing to support efforts that are thinking about labor all throughout the value  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:10):**  chain, both on the farm and all throughout food service and retail.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:14):**  Which is very often overlooked.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:16):**  Exactly.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:17):**  And I think, as I trace back to the beginning of this conversation and my background and  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:23):**  the work that I've done, part of what I like to say to more traditional investors is, look,  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:29):**  you know, the issues that the nonprofit sector are working on, I mean, we not only have sort  
**[0:19:33-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:33):**  of a moral and an ethical obligation to support that work because it is so critical, but also  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:40):**  in the food system, the issues and topics that the social sector is working on will,  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:46):**  you know, inevitably, from my perspective, become business model opportunities of the  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:50):**  not too distant future.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:52):**  And I think, you know, you can look back at how the good food movement, broadly speaking,  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:19:57):**  you know, was instigated and much of that came from the social sector, you know, raising  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:01):**  awareness and doing the things that, you know, the organizations I worked with and many,  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:05):**  many others like them were doing.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:07):**  And so, you know, I think there's a, there's sort of a, there's certainly a profit and  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:12):**  purpose dual motive in terms of our interest in supporting nonprofit organizations as well.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:19):**  And when you look at the workers' health, let's call it a bit broadly, what kind of  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:24):**  models do you see there in terms of disruption, in terms of, I can imagine a lot of traceability  
**[0:20:30-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:30):**  and proven that you're paying well and fairly, etc., but in terms of opportunities, what  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:37):**  do you see, what comes across your desk?  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:39):**  Yeah, that's a good, that's a really good question.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:41):**  And definitely, you know, with the, with the advent and the emerging ability to track and  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:47):**  trace and certification systems, I think there's, there's certainly some good precedent that  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:52):**  can be built upon.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:53):**  But I also see some significant opportunities for disruption of some of those models that  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:20:58):**  have, you know, done a great job, again, in terms of raising awareness, but the implementation  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:02):**  and, you know, the transparency of the programs isn't always what, you know, certainly what  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:08):**  consumers are looking for necessarily.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:10):**  I think there are going to be a lot of opportunities on information exchange.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:15):**  So I think that is, that is an area where I'm seeing, you know, I've seen three or four  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:22):**  different platforms using and leveraging, you know, information and information systems  
**[0:21:27-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:27):**  to aggregate experiences on the farm that, you know, are going to end up being incredibly  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:34):**  useful from just a data perspective.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:37):**  And then, you know, again, the extent to which those are, are capable of connecting into  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:42):**  tracking and tracing and those other systems that are being, you know, created to identify  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:48):**  attributes as they move through the system.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:51):**  I think there's some extraordinary opportunity there.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:21:54):**  So we're definitely excited about supporting a team in that space, for sure.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:01):**  Very, very interesting.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:03):**  And in terms of, let's have a look at investments of your personal investments.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:09):**  Do you remember your first sustainable food system or regenerative agriculture investment?  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:17):**  And if so, which one was it?  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:18):**  Sure.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:19):**  Yeah, I do.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:20):**  At least to be clear from a financial investment perspective.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:25):**  Because I think that, you know, there's many different ways in which you can think about  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:29):**  investing time, resources, knowledge, and you know, capital across many dimensions.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:34):**  But yes.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:35):**  Yeah, no, definitely financial.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:36):**  I was an early stage investor in Imperfect Produce, which is a Bay Area based company  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:43):**  that has developed a distribution system for what they call ugly produce or imperfect produce.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:49):**  So food that would otherwise go to waste because it isn't up to an aesthetic code.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:22:56):**  And they've built and developed a distribution system for that food and they're doing extremely  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:01):**  well.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:02):**  And it's an amazing team.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:03):**  And a team that, you know, is very near and dear to my own heart because they got their  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:08):**  start in the nonprofit sector, building a national network of food recovery organizations  
**[0:23:13-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:13):**  on college campuses and identified a business model opportunity to brand Imperfect Produce.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:20):**  And they've done an incredible job and they continue to grow.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:23):**  And it's been very exciting to be at least a small part of their growth and their trajectory.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:30):**  Fascinating.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:31):**  And if you look at the FS6, the upcoming cohort, what are you looking for?  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:37):**  If people are listening, they're wondering, but does my company or does a company I know  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:43):**  fit into this cohort?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:45):**  What are the characteristics, criteria, etc. to be starting in August?  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:50):**  Yeah, that's a good question.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:52):**  And I will say it can be, it's not a simple answer, which I'm sure you won't be surprised  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:56):**  to hear when you're talking about something as complex as the food system.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:23:59):**  There are a lot of different ways in which you could consider, you know, how you may  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:04):**  want to affect change.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:06):**  So the first thing I would say is, you know, if there are entrepreneurs that are listening  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:10):**  to this that are thinking about, you know, having an impact and wanting to create an  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:15):**  impact on, you know, some of the critical issues related to sustainability and food  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:19):**  production through a variety of means, or have a business product or service that is,  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:25):**  you know, thinking about what the health outcomes are as related to the food system, reach out.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:30):**  It's you know, we are certainly excited about hearing ideas and concepts and research.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:40):**  Those are, you know, those are all really important for us to, you know, continue to  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:43):**  do our jobs well in terms of informing the broader ecosystem about what's going on out  
**[0:24:48-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:48):**  there.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:49):**  So I, we are best suited to lend support through our program to teens who are past the kind  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:24:58):**  of idea or concept stage, and who have some product market fit, some traction in the marketplace  
**[0:25:04-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:04):**  and tend to be, and again, there are certainly notable exceptions here, but tend to be pre-institutional  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:12):**  capital.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:13):**  That is where I think we are best suited to lend support.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:15):**  And of course, because we support nonprofit organizations, if that's the designation,  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:20):**  we're excited to hear about your work.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:23):**  You know, again, there are certainly exceptions there because we're, for example, talking  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:27):**  to a team that has raised significantly more capital, but is very interested in expanding  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:33):**  their impact focus and in really thinking through some of the issues related to their  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:39):**  supply chain.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:40):**  So, you know, there are certainly exceptions in terms of, you know, the stage of a company.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:45):**  So, you know, it's never, it's never too early to introduce yourself.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:47):**  We'd love to hear, you know, what you're working on.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:50):**  But generally speaking, it's, it's within that very early stage.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:54):**  And if you look at, let's say the last year and you've been working with these teams of  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:25:59):**  the first cohort, you've been working with a lot of investors on the other side and you  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:04):**  already touched upon it a bit earlier, but I would like to go a bit deeper into that  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:07):**  on blended capital.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:09):**  What's could the role be or stacked capital, what's the role of the different layers and  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:13):**  what do you see in these disruptors that they need and what maybe the market isn't offering  
**[0:26:20-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:20):**  yet, but that you're hopefully figuring out in the next few cohorts how to use different  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:26):**  types of capitals and why is it so important to, financial capital in this case, so important  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:30):**  to use different ones to actually get these disruptors to scale and the impact that they  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:36):**  should have?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:37):**  Yeah, that's a really good question.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:39):**  And it's certainly something that we're spending a lot of time, like I mentioned, developing  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:42):**  some content around and we'll be doing both a webinar as well as some white papers on  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:47):**  the topic based on, again, some of the case studies that we're seeing in the space as  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:53):**  well as some of our teams that are working through these issues.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:26:57):**  So it's a very active and new kind of area.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:27:02):**  And so from my perspective, I think the opportunity that these teams represent from an impact  
**[0:27:11-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:27:11):**  standpoint and the requirement of more patient capital to help them get to scale, prove their  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:27:18):**  concept, I mean, given the fact that there is the complexity of the living production  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:27:23):**  system sitting underneath their tool or technology or business model or program, the need for  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:27:28):**  just longer lead times to be able to actually prove things out, I think there's a really  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:27:34):**  critical role for philanthropic capital to play in that space because what that's also  
**[0:27:38-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:27:38):**  doing is creating the opportunity for us to generate learnings, which are going to absolutely  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:27:46):**  help advance the field and other types of businesses that are coming into the space.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:27:51):**  So I think there is not only an opportunity for that form of capital to help teams get  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:27:57):**  to a point at which they're able to bring on other types of investors, but also it is  
**[0:28:04-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:28:04):**  a very, very powerful way to build the field and to continue to build the capacity of other  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:28:12):**  types of stakeholders and entrepreneurs that are coming into the space.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:28:16):**  So again, there are a few case studies in terms of how this is playing out.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:28:24):**  I think it's a really dynamic space and place for family offices and foundations that are  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:28:30):**  interested in making direct investments into teams because there's a lot to learn through  
**[0:28:36-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:28:36):**  that process of being a mission-oriented, impact-focused investor at the table with  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:28:43):**  other types of investors and how does that work and how can it work.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:28:49):**  These are all very important questions in terms of thinking about the future of these  
**[0:28:55-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:28:55):**  kinds of businesses.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:28:56):**  We have certain types of entities and corporations and legal structures that are cropping up  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:03):**  to help further define this space and further create opportunities to think about how we  
**[0:29:09-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:09):**  blend profit and purpose.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:11):**  But when it comes to thinking differently about what the term sheet looks like and who's  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:16):**  at the table, I think there's a lot of opportunity to explore in that.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:21):**  So I definitely know that that's something that we're going to remain very actively engaged  
**[0:29:26-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:26):**  in and think we have the ability to bring a lot of the philanthropic community that  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:33):**  has been focused on some very critical food system issues to the table to really help  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:40):**  influence and inform how these teams grow too.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:43):**  I think that's the other significant opportunity that we have when we think about the resources  
**[0:29:49-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:49):**  and the knowledge that come with philanthropic capital that's been so active in the space.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:29:55):**  I think it's a whole different way of thinking about affecting change.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:00):**  A lot of the philanthropic community's focus has been on field building and awareness raising  
**[0:30:06-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:06):**  and on changing what might be construed as bad corporate habits and that all absolutely  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:13):**  needs to continue.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:14):**  But I would add to that that there's an opportunity to also help influence what the next generation  
**[0:30:20-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:20):**  of food companies and agriculture companies is going to look like and being able to pivot  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:28):**  and adjust how we think about this.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:32):**  Again, I think it's a really live opportunity and can really help carve out this future  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:39):**  food system in a very unique and interesting way.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:43):**  Do you have an example of maybe your first cohort or anything else in your network where  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:51):**  these different types of capital have come together and supported a very disruptive team?  
**[0:30:57-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:30:58):**  Again, this is new, but there are some examples in the space.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:04):**  Revolution Foods, which is a company that I actually referenced as being part of my  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:08):**  own journey, got its start through a variety of different forms of funding, including some  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:14):**  funding from the Kellogg Foundation and RSF Social Finance, as well as some city funding  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:20):**  from the city of Oakland.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:22):**  There's definitely a blended approach there at the early stages of their company.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:29):**  Most recently, there's a company called Appeal, which is a food waste and food preservation  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:35):**  company primarily coming to market through developing countries that got its start from  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:42):**  grant funding from the Gates Foundation and most recently received a round of venture  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:47):**  capital financing from DBL Investors.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:50):**  There is a soil health company called Midwestern Bioag that recently received an investment  
**[0:31:54-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:54):**  from the McKnight Foundation.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:56):**  We're definitely starting.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:31:57):**  At the end, there are a few others in the space.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:00):**  As I mentioned, we're actively supporting some of our teams right now in this landscape.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:06):**  Again, it's emergent to some degree, but again, very exciting opportunity to really think  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:15):**  differently about how we scale entrepreneurs.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:19):**  I would like to end this podcast with two questions actually.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:24):**  Let's say, I mean, hopefully they're all smart in the audience, but there are a number of  
**[0:32:28-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:28):**  smart impact investors in the audience and also a number of smart foundations and nonprofits  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:34):**  that have been active in maybe the more field building and awareness before.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:39):**  What would you say to, the answer can be different for the two groups that want to become active  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:45):**  in the new food system space, the food system six in the transition.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:49):**  What would you tell these two different groups that for you would be the best way to get  
**[0:32:54-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:54):**  active in this space?  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:32:56):**  Can you remind me again of the two different?  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:00):**  Yes, you are smart impact investors and the nonprofit side, the foundations that have  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:05):**  been maybe more on the field building side, maybe more on the awareness side, but are  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:10):**  interested obviously in these very disruptive teams, but they don't really know where to  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:14):**  start.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:15):**  Great.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:16):**  As far as the impact investors are concerned, I think that there definitely needs to be  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:22):**  a level of understanding about just how complex the system is.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:27):**  I think that looking to some of the well-established NGOs in the space, depending on what your  
**[0:33:36-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:36):**  area of interest is in terms of the supply chain.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:40):**  For example, I think we can't think about the future of food production without looking  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:45):**  at the work that the Land Institute has done on perennial grain production.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:51):**  I think we can't think about other, for example, seafood and where the opportunities are to  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:33:59):**  invest in regenerative ocean economies without looking at the likes of some of the work that  
**[0:34:03-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:03):**  the Moore Foundation has supported.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:05):**  I think it's really important for there to be just a good context setting and an understanding  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:13):**  of where we are in this moment of time.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:17):**  I point to some of those organizations.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:18):**  There are many others like them, Stone Barns, the Center for Land-based Living here in Davis.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:23):**  There are some really important leaders, thought leaders, and researchers and a knowledge base  
**[0:34:28-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:28):**  that I think really needs to be accessed while identifying investment, while looking at or  
**[0:34:35-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:35):**  examining investment opportunities in the space.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:37):**  I think those two have to go hand in hand.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:40):**  On the other side, I think from the foundation perspective, I think it's about thinking that  
**[0:34:47-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:47):**  there is that the opportunity exists to create an impact in a new and different way that  
**[0:34:55-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:34:55):**  is really, really influential and really impactful to help shape the journeys of these innovators  
**[0:35:02-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:02):**  and these disruptors.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:03):**  I think there's a little bit of a mindset shift that needs to happen in order to support  
**[0:35:09-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:09):**  that, which is to say, if you choose to make an investment in a company, yes, you are choosing  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:17):**  to invest in the success of that company, but the importance of scaling impact along  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:22):**  with that company and the role that a foundation and all of that knowledge capital can play  
**[0:35:27-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:27):**  in helping do that in the right way, I think it's just such a critical opportunity.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:33):**  So I think that's how I would probably characterize my advice for those two different groups of  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:40):**  stakeholders.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:41):**  I want to thank you so much, Renske, for this interview and to take your time.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:46):**  And of course, I will link below as many of the parties you mentioned, but also the link  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:51):**  to apply for the new cohort for anybody that wants to know more and see if they fit.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:35:58):**  And I will be sure to check in with the new cohort and very interesting companies.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:36:03):**  I mean, it was a very interesting one, the first cohort, and I'm sure the second one  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:36:06):**  will be even more interesting.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:36:08):**  So be sure to be checking in and see how they are doing and how SF6 is doing in the future.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:36:15):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:36:16):**  Thank you so much.

**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:36:19):**  We talked about blended capital and about the whole food system.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:36:22):**  So not just the agriculture and the production part, but about the disruptions that are needed  
**[0:36:26-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:36:26):**  to really make this a food system that works for all.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:36:30):**  I hope you enjoyed it and see you back soon for more of these podcasts.

**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:37:25):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:37:29):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:37:33):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:37:35):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:37:39):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:37:44):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:37:49):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?

**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:38:51):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:38:55):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:39:00-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:00):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.

**[0:39:05-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:05):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:12):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:14):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:19):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:24):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:39:29-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:29):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:30):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:39:35-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:35):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:39):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:44):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:39:45-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:45):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:47):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:49):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:53):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:39:55):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/28/renske-lynde/#t=0:40:00):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

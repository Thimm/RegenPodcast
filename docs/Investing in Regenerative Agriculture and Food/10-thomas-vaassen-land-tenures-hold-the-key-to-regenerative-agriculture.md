**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:00:20):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:00:21):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:00:31):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:00:44):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:00:54):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:00:58):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:01:02):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:01:06):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:01:10):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:01:15):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:01:19):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:01:24):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:01:31):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:01:35):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:01:36):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, agriculture as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:01:40):**  In these interviews I am talking to people who are scaling up the sector, either by increasing  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:01:45):**  the influx of capital or by working underground to scale up the enterprises underground.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:01:51):**  Why regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:01:52):**  Because so many of the world current issues come together in this subject.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:01:56):**  From drought to water scarcity, climate change, social issues, hunger, obesity all have a  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:01):**  connection to how we grow food and what we eat.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:05):**  You're going to listen to an interview with Thomas Vassen of Landmap.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:07):**  I'm a small angel investor in their company.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:11):**  They're working on land right documentation for rural communities.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:14):**  Because to really unlock economic development you need property rights.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:19):**  And what do farmers have?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:20):**  Land.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:21):**  But no farmer will ever invest in something regenerative or even sustainable if they don't  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:25):**  have their land rights and thus a long-term perspective.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:29):**  So this could unlock a lot of potential development for the five to six hundred million smallholder  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:34):**  farmers we have in this world.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:35):**  And we depend on them for a lot.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:37):**  For our daily coffee, chocolate and tea.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:40):**  Just to give a few examples.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:42):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:45):**  Agriculture as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:46):**  I'm Koen van Zeyen, the host of today.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:49):**  In the podcast today I'm talking to Thomas Vassen, co-founder and CTO of Landmap, a startup  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:53):**  out of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, delivering affordable land rights documentation to rural  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:57):**  communities.  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:58):**  Welcome Thomas.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:02:59):**  Hello Koen.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:03:01):**  So to dive in with a personal question.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:03:04):**  Why are you doing what you're doing after a comfortable, not really comfortable, but  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:03:09):**  a startup life in Amsterdam, why did you decide to work with rural communities and land rights?  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:03:14):**  Yeah, I got caught with a certain virus, I guess.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:03:19):**  And then it's hard to not do it.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:03:22):**  Yeah, I think after working in the social enterprise sector for about seven years, I  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:03:31):**  put a lot of thought in what I really believe that kind of unlocks value creation, unlocks  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:03:37):**  economic development.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:03:39):**  And at some point I had an insight around property rights, that those are really essential  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:03:43):**  for building an economy.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:03:46):**  And once I started seeing that, looking into how does the bottom billion of this planet  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:03:50):**  actually arrange their property rights.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:03:53):**  And Andres Soto, a Peruvian economist, wrote a lot about that.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:03:59):**  And seeing that they have a big asset, which is land.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:04:01):**  So that's why I got caught in the sense of looking into land rights and understanding  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:04:06):**  there's a whole range of research and people actually working on that.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:04:11):**  So it was a process and slowly that developed into an idea of a company, a business that  
**[0:04:17-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:04:17):**  provides that land rights documentation through a business model, which was kind of new.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:04:25):**  And also in the process I met, I had dinner with a friend and also a colleague at the  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:04:29):**  Impact Hub who had been working also alongside for about five years in a global team.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:04:34):**  And I think he was also ready to make a move.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:04:36):**  So I think just things started to catch fire at some point.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:04:40):**  And that's how it got started.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:04:43):**  And when you look at unlocking land rights, you ended up in Ghana with cocoa farmers.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:04:50):**  Can you describe the steps and the process that made you end up there instead of basically  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:04:56):**  any other place where the bottom billion is trying to secure their property rights?  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:05:03):**  Yeah, you know how that goes.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:05:06):**  You can explain it in a very rational way, but it's not, that's only when you look back.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:05:13):**  So initially we just wanted to have trials and tests in various countries.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:05:17):**  And we did do a pilot in Albania with an NGO on farmers whose land was actually taken from  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:05:24):**  them in the communist time.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:05:27):**  And then it had to be redistributed.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:05:30):**  So it was an interesting experience.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:05:32):**  Also in Indonesia we found an interesting party that sources cocoa beans from farmers  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:05:39):**  in Sumatra, was willing to work with us.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:05:43):**  And we met about 200.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:05:45):**  And in Ghana the story was that we initially started speaking with all the experts in the  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:05:51):**  field.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:05:52):**  And then several people also mentioned to us, you've got to speak with a guy at Omidyar,  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:05:55):**  Omidyar Network, who is basically the only big Impact VC that focuses particularly on  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:06:02):**  this topic.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:06:03):**  So we were quite eager to speak.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:06:06):**  And after a couple of calls and meetings, it was like, yeah, you should speak with these  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:06:11):**  guys in Ghana because they've tried this before in another constellation of people.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:06:16):**  And it actually stopped, but not due to market conditions.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:06:22):**  So we had a call with one of these Canadians who had been doing this basically.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:06:29):**  And slowly we came to Ghana, spoke more, and slowly explored the market as if like any  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:06:37):**  of the other markets that we were exploring, because we were also looking into, I think  
**[0:06:40-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:06:40):**  at that point, Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:06:47):**  But for certain reasons Ghana made a lot of sense.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:06:52):**  I mean, the language is good, it's English.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:06:55):**  The culture is very open to foreign, I think foreign kind of involvement, and it's safe.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:07:03):**  It's been tried and tested there.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:07:06):**  But also there's been like 15 years of land reform pushed from the World Bank top down  
**[0:07:10-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:07:10):**  and they didn't deliver the results they wanted, but it did create some kind of political willingness,  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:07:21):**  basically, and it's kind of some framework.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:07:24):**  I think we've seen that as well in Indonesia, that it's good that there's been like a decade  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:07:29):**  of top down land reform pushed, that at least kind of makes people aware of the situation,  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:07:35):**  of the challenge.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:07:37):**  And we take it much more bottom up.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:07:41):**  But the policies are kind of somewhat more ready for our work to be done.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:07:46):**  Yeah, and so the rest is more serendipitous.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:07:49):**  I mean, we've met the people there, slowly met survey, a land lawyer and various experts.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:07:56):**  And then at some point it just seemed to be the best opportunity to take, to really take  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:08:01):**  it forward.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:08:02):**  Because in none of these countries we could do this ourselves, right?  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:08:05):**  We're not the ones that can negotiate with chiefs one on one as a white guy.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:08:11):**  We're not the ones that know how to operate and navigate the surveying sector and the  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:08:18):**  political sector, etc, etc.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:08:21):**  So the fact that we could bring on these Canadians slowly, step by step, was also a key reason.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:08:29):**  And if you look at the process now, compared to maybe when you started, can you walk us  
**[0:08:35-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:08:35):**  through the steps of what actually happens on the ground when you're surveying and unlocking  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:08:42):**  this value and how much of the process has changed compared to the trial you did and  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:08:47):**  actually how you're running it today?  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:08:49):**  Yeah, it's a nice one.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:08:52):**  So initially, I mean, first we had the idea that was more like people actually could themselves  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:08:59):**  map their land using a smartphone.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:09:02):**  And then they would actually crowd validate that, meaning the crowd, meaning their neighbors  
**[0:09:07-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:09:07):**  and previous occupants, etc. would get like a notification like, hey, Mr Kwame has a,  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:09:17):**  has mapped his land and attests that this is his.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:09:20):**  And could you verify that?  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:09:22):**  Could you verify his boundaries and his ownership type, etc.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:09:27):**  And then if sufficient people like support it and there's no counterclaims, you could  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:09:31):**  like more, the likelihood that it's actually yours could rise and at some point could be  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:09:36):**  sufficient for third parties and banks to then distribute loans or credit based on that.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:09:42):**  And slowly it becomes like a very like independent repository of land claims that totally circumvent  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:09:51):**  the existing government characteristics.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:09:56):**  That was like the dream and idea in the beginning.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:09:59):**  And we've asked, we tested it, but it's like the farmers weren't willing to pay anything  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:10:03):**  for that.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:10:04):**  They were like, yeah, but the chief or the government doesn't authorize or sign it and  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:10:08):**  now it's useless.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:10:10):**  So it's so an ingrained system that they're used to like when certain authority signs  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:10:17):**  it then it's real and all the other stuff is, you know, doesn't have value to them.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:10:23):**  So we'd have to kind of let go of that one.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:10:28):**  And then in the tests it was more like mapping.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:10:32):**  So you have a GPS device, they have like three meter accuracy.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:10:36):**  We built a form, like you walk around the parcel and then ask a bunch more questions,  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:10:42):**  make some photographs, fingerprints.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:10:45):**  And we did that.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:10:46):**  And that is initially, and we did initially, in the pilot that is sufficient for like knowing  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:10:50):**  the parcel size roughly, which is interesting for all the commodity buyers, for example,  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:10:57):**  and for certification purposes, for technical assistance, for various reasons that's useful  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:11:03):**  because most farmers don't know the size or they over underestimated significantly.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:11:07):**  Yeah, you could put it on a map, right?  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:11:10):**  For the data it's useful, but it's not sufficient for surveying.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:11:15):**  I mean, what you will see if you look on a map for those kinds of parcels and some commodity  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:11:20):**  buyers have done this themselves for thousands of parcels, you know, it's not survey or great.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:11:26):**  Accuracies are not good enough.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:11:28):**  You see slight slivers and overlaps, which is not allowed basically for surveying.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:11:34):**  The data quality integrity is not good enough.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:11:39):**  So what we end up with now is quite a sophisticated, integrated kind of hardware, software and  
**[0:11:46-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:11:46):**  data management solution.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:11:47):**  Of course, you have to look for quite cheaper alternatives to the GPS devices.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:11:53):**  You know, the survey agreed that devices are 10,000 euros and up, so we had to really work  
**[0:11:58-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:11:58):**  with kind of novel devices and kind of hack them a bit and develop software.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:12:05):**  We can have now devices about 700 euros and they're linked to an Android tablet that we  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:12:10):**  have and so the mapping is much more sophisticated.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:12:14):**  There's also pillaring of the different corners of the field.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:12:18):**  Takes a bit longer and then the interview we do with the farmer takes also about 40  
**[0:12:22-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:12:22):**  minutes in the village where we have our interviewers write a whole lengthy testimony of how the  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:12:29):**  parcel was acquired and about 200 questions about the legalities of it.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:12:35):**  There's a witness walking around with the farmer in the parcel to also check whether  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:12:41):**  the boundaries are correct.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:12:43):**  There's a lot of bio data and household data that we collect in addition, which we could  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:12:47):**  also use for other purposes.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:12:49):**  Yeah, there's like a thousand things more that we found out and have kind of implemented  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:12:56):**  over the months.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:12:58):**  Let's say the farmer is ill or very old and there's a representative and there's a whole  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:13:03):**  process with the power of attorney to go through, for example.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:13:08):**  So once it becomes legal, that's a bit my point.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:13:11):**  Once it becomes legal and technical, it's like there's a lot of nitty-gritty details  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:13:15):**  that we have to take care of that if ever the document ends up in court and there's  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:13:19):**  landmine on it that we can show the whole audit trail, like all the stuff we've taken  
**[0:13:25-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:13:25):**  to assure that the data is correct.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:13:28):**  So that also continues after the data has been collected.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:13:31):**  It's being sent to our servers and then in the office in Accra, in the capital of Ghana,  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:13:36):**  then there's the data coordinators who actually check through all that data and verify it.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:13:41):**  The office has to go back to the field for checks and also clean it and make sure it's  
**[0:13:46-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:13:46):**  presentable from simple things like spell checks to very important things like cross-referencing  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:13:53):**  the claims, like you have leasehold or freehold claims to the land and that depends on your  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:13:58):**  ethnicity.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:13:59):**  Those things all have to be verified.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:14:03):**  So through that, yeah, and after that there's a whole process of having it signed so there's  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:14:07):**  about seven or eight signatures being appended by various authorities and that's also like  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:14:13):**  a whole logistical chain basically before it can be sent back to the farmer.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:14:20):**  So I think that's a long story.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:14:22):**  The short one is more like, yeah, initially the idea is that like have farmers themselves  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:14:26):**  map it through a phone and then pivoting more towards like kind of more simple mapping solution  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:14:31):**  that any representative in the field could use, like maybe a commodity buyer have a lot  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:14:36):**  of officers in the field, they could then map the land, we could give them a commission  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:14:40):**  and collect the data in that way to finding out that that is not going to cut it in terms  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:14:45):**  of data quality integrity.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:14:47):**  So we have built our own team, we have built our own software and hardware solution, we  
**[0:14:50-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:14:50):**  have our own trainings and our team goes out and it's like a whole professional kind of  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:00):**  chain of activity that goes through hundreds of steps from farmer field to office back  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:07):**  to farmer that we are now kind of running.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:11):**  And that's been a trial and error process.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:17):**  And so when we talk about unlocking, how does this in your vision of the future, maybe not  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:23):**  at the moment, like at this moment now, but in the near future and the longer term future,  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:28):**  how does this unlock value for the smallholder farmers?  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:33):**  Yeah, so in two ways.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:35):**  I mean, one of them is that these are like this formal sector, people are not documented.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:41):**  They might not even remember their birthday.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:44):**  Right.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:45):**  So the only way to access them is either to visit them in person and create some kind  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:51):**  of profile that you know, who are you?  
**[0:15:54-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:54):**  What is your life?  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:55):**  What does your life consist of?  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:15:58):**  What is your productive capacity?  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:00):**  And what are your ambitions to expand your parcel, for example, replant your cocoa trees  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:05):**  in this case, add fertilizers.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:10):**  There's a lot of technical systems and inputs are actually are available, but they don't  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:14):**  reach these particular farmers often.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:17):**  So that's the first step, like by documenting.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:20):**  Because they're literally not on the map.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:22):**  Yeah, they're not on the map.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:23):**  And yeah, they're illiterate and they might not have a phone number yet.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:26):**  So just by collecting all the data and presenting, so next to the whole legal contract, you also  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:31):**  get a profile about their farm and about their households.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:36):**  They get that in print and we keep that in digital storage.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:41):**  And actually, if you talk with service providers, financial service providers, technical service  
**[0:16:46-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:46):**  providers, micro insurance, and others, that's what they're mostly interested in, in data  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:54):**  about these people at certain scale, but also with a certain quality that you can really  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:16:59):**  trust it.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:17:00):**  And so what we've seen so far is that there is quite some data about farmers, but it's  
**[0:17:04-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:17:04):**  you know, it's quite, it's old, it's not maintained, and it's often incorrect.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:17:12):**  It's not verified, it's not double checked.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:17:13):**  So it's often incorrect and the farmers are sometimes getting a bit fed up about all these  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:17:18):**  questionnaires and they just give random answers.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:17:20):**  So that's the first thing I think that is needed.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:17:24):**  The second step is more that, yeah, once they have the document that can be considered collateral,  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:17:30):**  not in the fact that these parties would take over the land if a farmer maybe defaults,  
**[0:17:36-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:17:36):**  or they could, but it's more a proxy or an indication that somebody has an asset and  
**[0:17:43-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:17:43):**  has been going through a lot of effort to actually register and secure it.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:17:50):**  That means something, that means that they value it, that probably means that it's productive,  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:17:53):**  probably means that they can have a certain repayment capacity.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:17:56):**  So that's the second big step.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:17:58):**  And then the third one is more really connectivity and something we haven't done yet, but what  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:18:04):**  we're going to pilot in the next few months is actually connecting them to mobile money  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:18:08):**  providers, actually signing them up for mobile money while we do the interview.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:18:13):**  So that's from that point onwards, we have a payment relationship, which is ongoing.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:18:18):**  We could have additional contact through SMS or IVR processes where you have some option  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:18:24):**  to maintain an ongoing communication, which can also be very valuable.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:18:29):**  And I think at that point through those steps, you can unlock additional services and through  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:18:34):**  that make the farmer and the farm more worthy of investment, ready for investment, and through  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:18:42):**  that improve the likelihoods.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:18:45):**  And when you look at, I know it has been, I mean, you're working in a startup, so it's  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:18:51):**  been every day is new and different, etc.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:18:55):**  But when you look at the last year, I know a lot has happened.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:18:58):**  Can you walk us through a bit what you've been busy with from like, if you look at a  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:19:05):**  year ago, which is March 2016, what has changed?  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:19:09):**  And also, if you look maybe ahead a year from now, what do you think will be different and  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:19:15):**  will be different for LandMap?  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:19:17):**  Yeah, a lot, a lot, a lot.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:19:22):**  Last year, I think, yeah, about 15 months ago, my wife and I decided that we should  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:19:26):**  live in Ghana for a year.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:19:28):**  So that was a big step.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:19:30):**  And I think it's been a very interesting year in that regard to really live there.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:19:37):**  And then about this week, a year ago, we did the first sales.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:19:43):**  So we found somebody in the field in Ghana that has been working for what is called a  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:19:49):**  customer land secretariat, basically kind of a small office for a certain chief to organize  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:19:56):**  the land disputes and land documents in that area.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:20:00):**  And so he was willing to come on board.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:20:03):**  And we asked him to compose a team of mappers and interviewers.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:20:07):**  And then, yeah, so a year ago, we started actually selling and I built certain forms.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:20:17):**  And we just started collecting the data, collecting down payments.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:20:20):**  So farmers pay about 20% of the document to pay in down payments, let's say 20 euros.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:20:27):**  And actually, the funny thing was the first week, we did like amazing sales.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:20:30):**  It was crazy.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:20:31):**  Like 75 documents we sold, I think, in the first week.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:20:35):**  So we're like, wow, and readjusting our forecast, like this is going to go insane.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:20:42):**  And then three weeks after that, we sold just the same amount as the first week.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:20:46):**  So it's just like a lucky hit, funny enough.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:20:50):**  But soon enough, I started moving there and just building the company, which if you've  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:20:55):**  experienced it, I think, in the African markets, anything that takes like five minutes here,  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:21:02):**  it takes a whole day there, from opening a bank account to paying a salary to buying  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:21:08):**  a car and all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:21:10):**  So it's very operational.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:21:12):**  But the product development has been a lot of work.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:21:15):**  Just getting the details right, because it's legal, it's getting the details right and  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:21:18):**  different for each chieftaincy and building relationships was also quite key.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:21:24):**  So I think I've been very lucky to be able to work with these kind of experienced, couple  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:21:29):**  of experienced Canadians.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:21:31):**  Yeah, I think from being from that point onwards, things start to become real.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:21:38):**  And so at some point, I think, yeah, by the end of the year, we had a team of about 30  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:21:43):**  people, three offices, you know, a couple of cars, eight motorcycles, and a lot of capital  
**[0:21:50-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:21:50):**  expenditure has been made, a lot of training, a lot of devices, GPS, tablets, and several  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:21:57):**  thousand parcels mapped.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:22:00):**  So in a way, that's been like a bit of a roller coaster.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:22:02):**  But it also came with all these challenges, like we had several, several accidents happen.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:22:09):**  We had, you know, all kinds of issues in the team and employment issues.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:22:19):**  We had, you know, all the stuff from like power failures all the time, elections coming  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:22:25):**  up where we didn't, weren't able to work for a week.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:22:28):**  Yeah, basically things breaking down all the time and spending half my day on just getting  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:22:32):**  it to work before I even had time to actually build more stuff on top of it.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:22:39):**  Yeah, so it's always hard to give like a real sense of what it's like.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:22:45):**  I mean, I was like in the field every two weeks, meeting with the field team, spending  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:22:49):**  a couple of nights there, doing some upgrades to the systems, discussing the issues that  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:22:53):**  came up with the customers.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:22:55):**  And then again, back to the office and building the data systems.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:01):**  And yeah, it's I think one of the interesting things is really through this process by reselling  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:07):**  something is really understanding the customary land system, which is quite different than  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:12):**  if you investigated or research it or even doing that.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:15):**  I don't know if in the project, kind of by selling something, we had to negotiate with  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:19):**  the chiefs.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:20):**  We had to sit down with a bunch of chiefs and negotiate on the farmer's behalf on the  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:25):**  signing fees, for example, or on the fact if we could even allow to work in that area.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:30):**  And then you really get to understand the way it works and the way they operate and  
**[0:23:36-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:36):**  think and behave, et cetera.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:39):**  And that was really interesting to see that from so close that this has been like a kind  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:43):**  of, you know, it's quite archaic model and it's, you know, it worked for maybe a couple  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:49):**  of hundred years and, you know, it's still in place.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:51):**  It's still the most influential, powerful system in the whole rural Africa, basically  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:57):**  through customary authority.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:23:59):**  So and next to that, the fact how, you know, how farmers think and behave and how far removed  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:24:06):**  that is from our Western way of thinking, how to make decisions.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:24:10):**  And there are customers, so it's like, it's to kind of empathize and really understand  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:24:14):**  not to be nice and cute, but just to try and sell more and to really understand their realities  
**[0:24:20-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:24:20):**  and the seasonality, the patterns that they have to deal with and how they deal with money,  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:24:27):**  how they deal with value, how they deal with family relationships and all that stuff.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:24:31):**  So it's been like a crash course basically in that regard.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:24:35):**  And I think that's been the most valuable components to some extent.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:24:39):**  Whether we're going to make it really successful is, will be dependent on, I think, that capacity  
**[0:24:45-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:24:45):**  to continuously integrate its rate on the learning from the field and not to be rigid  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:24:52):**  and you know, to really be super flexible and kind of continuously being adapted in  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:24:58):**  the field and from our customers.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:25:00):**  So yeah, and then by the end of the year, we started delivering our first documents  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:25:03):**  and of course, like a huge moment to really feel that we've now secured the land tenure  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:25:08):**  for some of these people.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:25:11):**  And it really works because of course, most experts have said that it totally won't work.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:25:18):**  So in that regard, it's been a breakthrough, I think, to really make it work.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:25:23):**  And now it's more to make it work at a certain scale and make it work also profitably, which  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:25:28):**  is the next step.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:25:31):**  And is that what you will be working on?  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:25:34):**  I mean, if we look, if we talk again a year from now, what do you hope you have achieved?  
**[0:25:40-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:25:40):**  Is that the scalability, different countries, different type of documents?  
**[0:25:47-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:25:47):**  Or is it really focused on the farm seal scale up like in Ghana as you're doing now?  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:25:54):**  Yeah, so I think it's, for us, is to make the whole product work.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:26:00):**  You have this way of thinking about product development while you start with the barebones,  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:26:06):**  just only the product itself, the core value that you're promising to the customer and  
**[0:26:11-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:26:11):**  making that work.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:26:13):**  And I think that this year is more about the total product approach, which is the product  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:26:18):**  in its context, let's say the way you distribute it, the way you market it, the way you integrate  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:26:24):**  it with other services.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:26:27):**  All the additional ways to kind of to make it flow, to make it work.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:26:32):**  So we have to improve our payment collections and spread it out over a certain period so  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:26:36):**  that it aligns with the cash flows of the farmers.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:26:40):**  We have to also, we're also building signature digitization options for cheaps and give them  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:26:46):**  a tablet so they can review documents digitally and sign, which saves a lot of time.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:26:51):**  We are building like these SMS solutions that farmers get messages when a document is ready  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:26:55):**  and these kinds of things.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:26:59):**  And of course, also maps and data solutions for all the additional stakeholders that they  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:04):**  can actually view and see what's going on in that field and might be willing to pay  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:09):**  for that.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:10):**  So there's a whole like kind of approach, everything around the core product that we  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:15):**  are working on to make sure that it's going to be even more accessible, more affordable  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:20):**  and more scalable.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:22):**  I think that's going to definitely take a lot of our time.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:25):**  And then yeah, the second product for residential parcels, we're going to launch it in a couple  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:30):**  of months as well.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:33):**  So that's like homeowners, people with houses, they also want to secure that land that we're  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:39):**  going to come to launch.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:42):**  It's a different, you know, it's more peri-urban and urban, so it's a different environment.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:46):**  In certain ways, it's easier in certain ways, there's also more competition.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:51):**  And so let's see how that goes.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:53):**  I think that's for now.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:27:54):**  And then the third thing is that yeah, there's a lot of opportunity for using this data in  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:28:01):**  a lot of other ways, I think, as we touched on, but particularly for credit provision,  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:28:06):**  financial services, that's the most straightforward option.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:28:11):**  So we're speaking with a couple of MFIs and rural banks to collaborate.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:28:16):**  And once we visit the villages and work with these farmers, what data do we need to collect  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:28:22):**  to build a simple credit profile and also have them access financial services.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:28:27):**  And when you look at this agriculture revolution that is happening in many parts of the world  
**[0:28:34-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:28:34):**  where farmers are, if they have the resources, of course, looking much more long term, trying  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:28:41):**  to decrease their inputs, trying to get to certain certification, become more sustainable,  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:28:47):**  etc.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:28:48):**  What do you see as a role of smallholder farmers that of course have a huge potential, but  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:28:53):**  at the same time huge constraints because of circumstances and may want to grow other  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:28:57):**  things but don't have maybe the financial means to make these long term bets or long  
**[0:29:03-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:29:03):**  term investments?  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:29:04):**  Do you see a role for this huge group of smallholder farmers?  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:29:06):**  And if so, how?  
**[0:29:08-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:29:08):**  Yeah, I mean, certain crops are so far just only grown by smallholders.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:29:15):**  Certain crops don't make, you know, you can't really do it in the plantation level so far.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:29:21):**  However, like the size of farms that they have currently, like one acre farms, also  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:29:27):**  doesn't really make sense.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:29:28):**  So there has to be some, there has to be some way of changing it around.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:29:32):**  So I do think that, yeah, a lot of the food provision will be done by smallholders still  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:29:42):**  over the next decades.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:29:45):**  And but it needs to be more integrated with the chain.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:29:51):**  So I think if you see certain value changing coffee, cocoa tea, well, palm and cotton,  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:29:57):**  there's a lot of effort also by the traders and then also by the manufacturers to try  
**[0:30:01-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:01):**  and, you know, work on the first mile.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:03):**  You know, what's the first mile, the first mile from the farmer.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:09):**  Certification that was the first step and sustainability and traceability is coming  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:13):**  up.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:14):**  So there's a lot of efforts being made because we all know that we're dependent on these  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:18):**  growers.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:19):**  And there's some interesting work being done, for example, in Ghana to say, well, can we  
**[0:30:24-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:24):**  combine certain plots so that we have a bigger area so we can then collaborate with a couple  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:31):**  of farmers together and it will become much more affordable to apply certain inputs or  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:36):**  to contract labor services and to make the whole operation more efficient because you  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:42):**  can make these farms efficient.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:45):**  You can triple or quadruple the outputs if you farm with different practices or if you  
**[0:30:51-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:51):**  apply certain inputs.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:52):**  But in some way, that's not really getting off the ground.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:30:55):**  So and one of the issues is that, yeah, like we started the conversations, there's no data,  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:31:04):**  there's no knowledge and that knowledge doesn't trickle down to the farmer level.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:31:10):**  So in a nutshell, I would say, yeah, we're going to be dependent if we want to eat chocolate  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:31:18):**  and drink coffee and use olive.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:31:22):**  There's certain other crops that you could do much more like soy.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:31:27):**  You don't need smallholders for it, but other crops.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:31:30):**  Interestingly enough, the high value crops, foods and vegetables, we're going to be dependent  
**[0:31:36-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:31:36):**  on smallholders.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:31:37):**  And yeah, there's a scenario through climate change and natural agents that their outputs  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:31:45):**  will actually only decrease year by year.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:31:49):**  And I think we're just more in this scenario where we're trying to counter that.  
**[0:31:52-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:31:52):**  We're trying to keep it stable and not yet there really to try and increase it or improve  
**[0:32:00-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:00):**  it.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:01):**  So I think all the effort is being made at the moment is just to try and counter the  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:04):**  effects of different rainfall patterns that we're seeing in Ghana or droughts that are  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:10):**  coming up at a massive scale.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:12):**  And that the people just like they don't know how to deal with them.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:15):**  They've been doing this for generations in a certain way.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:18):**  And to adapt to a different way of farming is very challenging.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:24):**  So a lot of effort has to be made.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:26):**  I think we hope by at least securing the tenure of the land will allow that investments can  
**[0:32:32-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:32):**  be made into it.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:33):**  Yeah, the simple example is if you cut down all the coca trees, you need to do that.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:38):**  You replant your trees, which are often very old.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:41):**  You need to replant them at some point.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:43):**  If you cut them down, the chief will come and say, oh, you cut the trees down.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:47):**  So I guess you're no longer interested in a parcel.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:49):**  I'm going to take it back.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:50):**  That's a default way of doing things.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:54):**  By documenting it and having it proven that it's yours, you can say, no, no, it's mine  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:32:58):**  and I'm just replanting it.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:33:00):**  And so you won't have that same challenge and risk.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:33:02):**  And so it means that farmers are not afraid to replant them, which they currently are.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:33:09):**  And so in that way, investment can be made and trees can be replanted and a whole parcel  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:33:15):**  can be regenerated and become productive again.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:33:20):**  These are some of the very basic, simple constraints that we're seeing in which the land documentation  
**[0:33:26-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:33:26):**  can play a role.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:33:28):**  And if you are, let's say you're a brave and hopefully smart impact investor looking to,  
**[0:33:37-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:33:37):**  let's say for in this case, play a role in the sustainable cocoa sector and wanting to  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:33:44):**  invest, what would be your advice?  
**[0:33:47-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:33:47):**  Yeah, I'm good.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:33:50):**  To could also be don't do it yet.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:33:52):**  I mean, it could be too early.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:33:54):**  But yeah, I think it's important to look at the systemic issues and pick one and try and  
**[0:34:03-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:34:03):**  make a dent for that particular systemic issue.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:34:06):**  Yeah, of course, from my perspective, this is the one that we're focusing on where we  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:34:13):**  see the biggest benefit to unlock all kinds of additional services.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:34:17):**  But I think it's possible.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:34:19):**  And there are definitely examples where entire areas get rejuvenated by a consortium of partners  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:34:28):**  that collaborate.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:34:30):**  And so I think that's those are the main components to look at.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:34:34):**  Is there a systemic issue you can focus on?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:34:35):**  And can you do it in collaboration with other partners?  
**[0:34:40-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:34:40):**  And can you do it in an economic way?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:34:46):**  So I think at least what we've seen is that do it as a business from the start, trying  
**[0:34:52-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:34:52):**  to make money from the start, trying to generate value from the start, don't just put in funds  
**[0:34:59-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:34:59):**  as a donation, but try and do it through a generative business model.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:06):**  Let's say also, for example, it's a simple example, but maybe just to see that there's  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:11):**  also trees in these cocoa farms, there's shade trees, they're important actually for cocoa  
**[0:35:15-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:15):**  growing.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:16):**  They improve the cocoa production.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:18):**  But the shade trees by themselves after 20, 30 years become very valuable.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:22):**  They're like hardwood trees.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:24):**  So there's currently not a way usually that the farmer can also have tree tenure so they  
**[0:35:32-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:32):**  can prove it's his or her trees.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:35):**  So again, the government official or the chief or even the neighbor might come and cut them  
**[0:35:41-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:41):**  down and they sell off the wood.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:43):**  And yeah, there's no way to stop them unless you can again prove that you've planted them.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:50):**  And you know, and it's simple.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:51):**  You can just tag the tree with a geo tag and take a picture, et cetera.  
**[0:35:57-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:57):**  We could do that while we're at the farm.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:35:59):**  It could be a significant source of additional revenue for the farmer.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:36:02):**  They could also incentivize them to take care of those shade trees better.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:36:07):**  And everybody wins.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:36:10):**  So and it's just by mapping and tagging them and providing legal documentation for them.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:36:18):**  You know, there's several, even carbon trading ventures kind of focusing on that in Western  
**[0:36:27-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:36:27):**  Africa.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:36:28):**  And so I think you could pick one of those things.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:36:31):**  You could say that's a systemic issue which across the globe, we can pick a pilot area,  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:36:35):**  you can collaborate with a certain number of parties, we can figure out how that works.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:36:40):**  And we could probably build a solution that can do that at scale and really benefit both  
**[0:36:46-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:36:46):**  the planet and those farmers and food production.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:36:48):**  That would be my advice, but I think it's up to anybody themselves to kind of see what  
**[0:36:55-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:36:55):**  is a topic that you really feel passionate about doing something for and then try and  
**[0:37:03-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:37:03):**  give it some thoughts.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:37:05):**  Thank you so much.

**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:37:12):**  I think we'll definitely be checking in how to scale up across the value chain and maybe  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:37:17):**  also other countries and other products is going to take place in the next years.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:37:23):**  And thanks again for taking the time this morning to talk.

**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:38:51):**  I'm super excited to share with you the online video course investing in regenerative agriculture  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:38:56):**  and food, how to put money to work in regenerating soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:39:01):**  food while doing it.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:39:02):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:39:04):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:39:08):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:39:13):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:39:18):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:39:20-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:39:20):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:39:23-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:39:23):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:39:25):**  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:39:28-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:39:28):**  What questions should you ask?  
**[0:39:29-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:39:29):**  What is happening in the space?

**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:40:12):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:40:15):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.

**[0:40:35-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:40:35):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:40:41-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:40:41):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:40:43):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:40:48):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:40:53-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:40:53):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:40:58):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:41:00):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:41:05-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:41:05):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:41:08):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:41:13):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:41:14-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:41:14):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:41:16):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:41:19):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:41:22):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:41:24):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/01/thomas-vaassen/#t=0:41:30):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

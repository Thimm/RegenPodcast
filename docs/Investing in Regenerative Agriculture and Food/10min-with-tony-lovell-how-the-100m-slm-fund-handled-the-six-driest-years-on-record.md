**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:00):**  You're listening to the summary of the interview. For a link to the full length episode, please check the description below.  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the planet mattered  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:19):**  To learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil people local communities and ecosystems  while making an appropriate and fair return  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:33):**  have their roots in how we treat our land grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors  big and small and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt soil underneath our feet  Before we get started I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I will definitely  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:51):**  continue to do so and release about an episode a month but at the same time I would love to take  this further share more interviews there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative  food and agriculture more depth improve the quality maybe even doing some video series  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:07):**  So I started a patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself if these  podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means I invite you to support me and make this  happen for more information please find the link to my patreon account in the description below  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:22):**  And now without further ado the interview. Enjoy!  SLM partners was SLM stands for Sustainable Land Management  So we started in 2012 raised 75 million dollars from a Danish pension fund  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:40):**  another 30 million dollars worth of finance from an international bank Rabobank  incredibly supportive agricultural bank both of those groups are very  very supportive of the agriculture what we did was we acquired large areas of what we described  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:58):**  as inherently good quality country that have been degraded by inappropriate management unintentional  but inappropriate management and as a result of 150 years of set stocking in a seasonally dry  erratic rainfall and ecosystem productivity production performance biodiversity every  
**[0:02:17-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:17):**  thing had gone south had reduced so the intention was to acquire that property spend money on  infrastructure water fencing upgrades and then change the grazing management with the intention  to over the life of the fund a 10 to 15 year fund double carrying capacity halve cost of production  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:37):**  and be a large scale low cost producer of high quality grass fed protein that was the project  fund the project thesis and it remains a project thesis we also said that we would as the  opportunities arose monetize I don't like the term but ecosystem services so carbon offsets  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:58):**  water and air quality offsets whatever came available biodiversity credits and we've been  able to do that as well so that's the basic thesis of the fund a very simple process buy the land  do the infrastructure change the management and allow nature to recover and bring back the  
**[0:03:14-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:14):**  productivity that land inherently is is capable of okay well the total amount of land that we have  in in the fund itself is 480 000 hectares actively developed with water and fencing and the  infrastructures is about half of that 220 240 000 hectares and the other 200 000 hectares is large  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:40):**  scale in Australia Mulga is a leguminous native tree and it's a carbon project  the land that we've got is in terms of holistic management talk is um brittle tending so it's  erratic and unreliable rainfall patterns long-term averages long-term average rainfall for the  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:02):**  country we've got is around that 375 mill millimeters a year but that can vary widely  we bought in 2012 off the back of two very good seasons our country also gets beneficial flooding  so we'd had two very good seasons unfortunately with conventional management that's a very  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:22):**  good season unfortunately with conventional management that the benefit that we should  have received from that was pretty much ephemeral and didn't really run through  so we then ran into six of the driest years on record what that means is the first year is tough  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:45):**  the second year compounds off that keep going forward five or six and it gets pretty challenging  and the decision we made was and I don't describe it as de-stocking and one of the things that we do  I think is critically important is we match our stocking rates to our carrying capacity  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:06):**  we have probably in the last three to six months actually had some reasonable rain we had between  90 and 130 mils we are still a long way short of where we we would like to be on a long-term  average basis but that was combined with some beneficial flooding as we speak on the land that  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:27):**  we've got that received the beneficial flooding we are back up to just shy of 5 000 cattle  so on the ground the interesting thing has been the staff our team have been very positive the  whole way through because they can see the benefits of the decisions we're making they  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:48):**  can see that playing out on the land and especially after we did get the rain event  and the flooding that came through it is noticeable the difference in response of our  country managed appropriately or managed the way that we consider to be the correct way to manage  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:03):**  it compared to conventionally managed country over the fence on our neighbour's properties  the interesting thing is on on the land itself and I probably somewhat facetiously described it to  some of the people who were asking about how we were going some of the neighbours I said  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:21):**  the way I describe it is we're going broke slower than anybody else we weren't making money because  we had no stock obviously but because we weren't feeding and we weren't degrading our ecosystem  we were holding our own and we were actually in a position that when the rain did come  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:41):**  the very interesting observation from several of our managers and you could see it on the land was  that our land had far less runoff so this is land that has been passed and desperately looking for  rain for five or six years and when the rain event did turn up the amount of land that rejected that  
**[0:07:00-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:00):**  rain was terrifyingly disheartening it was just shocking that you know nice steady gentle rain  but it ran off because the land had been so degraded that it was unable to accept that rain  when it did arrive we had very little runoff in our country which means that what we did was we  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:17):**  got the benefit of the moisture when it did turn up that will take time to build on that again and  again but you start to build an ecosystem that actually accepts the moisture when it's available  whereas in a lot of cases a lot of these seasonally dry ecosystems have been so degraded  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:36):**  they actually reject the thing that they most desperately need when nature does provide it  which is fairly perverse but unfortunate reality  I think that the gap you've got is between a project size that makes sense from a third-party  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:58):**  manager like an SLM to run where you have to have a certain amount of capital involved to be able to  generate enough fees to be able to pay for the people that need to be there to run the project  so there's a certain minimum size and how you balance that minimum size up with a project that  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:14):**  makes sense with the requirement for the larger institutions to have to be able to deploy their  capital in big chunks so some of these multi-billion dollar institutions pension funds and  sovereign wealth funds etc want to be able to write a single ticket of 100 million dollars  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:36):**  or 500 million dollars but they don't want to be the only investors which means they're looking for  investable products that's 250 to 500 to a billion dollars  which is pretty hard to make sense of in the regenerative space  
**[0:08:56-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:56):**  the biggest constraint is probably the gap that you've got is somebody coming into investing in  regenerative ag there is a transition period so for an investor to come into the program what  they've got to do is really have a reporting time frame they've got to have an overall picture  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:18):**  that's at least a 15-year investment horizon so when they start they're in for 15 years  and they probably need to look at it in year five and year 10 and not worry about in the middle  so  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:32):**  just listen to the summary of the interview for the full length interview please find the link  in the description below if you found the investing in regenerative agriculture and  food podcast valuable there are a few simple ways you can use to support it number one rate and

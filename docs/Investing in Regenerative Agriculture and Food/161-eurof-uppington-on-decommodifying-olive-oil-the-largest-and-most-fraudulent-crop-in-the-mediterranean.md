**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:00:14):**  Such a key species in the Mediterranean, a region hit hard by climate change and political  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:00:18):**  unrest and we don't talk about it very often.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:00:21):**  The olive tree.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:00:22):**  Extremely high quality olive oil could almost be called a medicine, but most of the industry  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:00:27):**  has commodified and is only looking for the bare minimum quality and the lowest price.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:00:32):**  How do we decommodify this crucial crop and pay farmers for quality?  
**[0:00:36-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:00:36):**  And what can we learn here and apply elsewhere on other key crops in other regions?  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:00:43):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:00:47):**  the planet mattered podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:00:52):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:00:57):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:01:03):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:01:05):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:01:09):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:01:11):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:01:16):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:01:20):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:01:25):**  our work.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:01:26):**  And so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:01:28):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q and a webinars with former  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:01:32):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:01:45):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:01:47):**  Welcome to another episode today about olive oil.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:01:50):**  Good extra virgin olive oil is a superfood, but good fresh oil is very hard to find.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:01:55):**  So my guest of today started Amfora who helps customers to get their healthy, nutritious  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:00):**  oil they need when they need it.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:02):**  They work with their farmers to grow their businesses and preserve their communities.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:04):**  And they source their oils straight from small family run producers in Greece, who are too  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:09):**  small to access the export markets by themselves.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:12):**  And they deliver directly to your kitchen in zero waste reusable containers.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:16):**  There's so much to unpack them.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:17):**  Welcome Aarof.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:18):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:20):**  And you don't have an olive oil background.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:24):**  You don't have a very Greek name.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:25):**  So how did you end up selling basically direct to consumer extra virgin olive oil?  
**[0:02:31-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:31):**  Well I'm not Greek as you say, I'm actually originally from Wales in the UK, but I married  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:39):**  a Greek.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:40):**  My wife is from a very small village community in the Northern part of Greece in Ipirus.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:47):**  And that was really the start of everything when I went to visit that village in 2003,  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:54):**  I think.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:55):**  It basically was a revelation for me.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:02:59):**  Everything that we were eating was from there.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:03:03):**  It was the epitome of local and seasonal.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:03:08):**  The vegetables were grown on the other side of the valley by my mother-in-law.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:03:14):**  The other vegetables were foraged and everything came with this olive oil, which they make  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:03:21):**  themselves as well.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:03:23):**  And it was A, unutterably delicious.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:03:27):**  And B, there was just something so meaningful about it.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:03:33):**  There was just something so wonderful about having everything, knowing exactly where it's  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:03:40):**  from and everything just being utterly untouched, just incredibly natural.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:03:47):**  And that's how I started getting into this.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:03:51):**  But it took me about more than 20 years from that point for actually to start Amphora.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:03:57):**  I was working in finance as a portfolio manager.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:02):**  And at a certain point I just thought to myself, I've got to try this before I drop dead.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:10):**  I had this idea.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:12):**  So I actually was unemployed for a while.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:14):**  We were living in London.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:16):**  After I came back from the village, I went to these shops and I could see these incredibly  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:20):**  expensive olive oils.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:22):**  And then the next time I went to the village, I went to see Uncle Yanis.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:26):**  And I said, Yanis, have you seen the prices of olive oil?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:30):**  And he goes, oh, it's very hard for us.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:33):**  We don't get those prices.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:34):**  And I say, but you should.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:36):**  The markup is insane.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:39):**  And they said, yeah, we just get five euros a kilo for olive oil.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:43):**  I said, I'll pay six.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:45):**  And I took 70 litres back to London.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:48):**  I put it in these sort of tasteful little bottles.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:50):**  I found a little shop around the corner, a wine shop, sold out immediately.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:04:55):**  It was a great business, but it didn't seem to me very scalable.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:05:01):**  And I was earning a salary or was about to earn a salary as a portfolio manager.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:05:05):**  So I kept doing it in the background and sold some products to friends and colleagues.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:05:11):**  But to do it big scale, I felt there wasn't the distribution power.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:05:17):**  There wasn't the ability to leverage distribution.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:05:19):**  I would have to hire lots of salespeople.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:05:22):**  I would have to have a huge amount of infrastructure in order to be able to make this into a real  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:05:29):**  business.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:05:30):**  But really what happened since then is that we have the internet, we have companies like  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:05:37):**  Airbnb, we have these long tail business models.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:05:43):**  And it struck me that matching a customer to a farmer was going to be wonderful for  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:05:49):**  both of them.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:05:51):**  And all they needed was to have someone to do it for them.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:05:56):**  And that's really how I got into Amfor, that was the start.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:01):**  So thank you so much for that.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:02):**  And I mean, there's so much to unpack there.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:04):**  Let's start with the markup.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:05):**  Let's simply let's say that London shop where you went to when you came back from the trip  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:08):**  in Greece, an expensive bottle of oil, olive oil, because I think most people have no clue  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:14):**  how it gets so expensive and what the farmer actually gets because you say five euros a  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:18):**  kilo.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:19):**  What does it even mean in oil?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:20):**  What does it mean for the farmer?  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:21):**  Let's unpack a bit the economics currently for olive oil.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:24):**  Well, in fact, as I later found out, five euros a kilo is a really good price for a  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:30):**  typical farmer.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:32):**  So the way a litre of olive oil gets to an end customer, obviously, it comes from the  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:38):**  farmer.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:39):**  The farmer, however, typically doesn't have their own olive mill.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:43):**  So they take it to the communal mill.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:46):**  And then you have to pay the mill guy.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:50):**  A lot of farmers take the product back themselves for their own use or to give to friends and  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:06:57):**  relations or to sell themselves.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:07:00):**  So that five euros a kilo is for like olives that haven't been pressed yet?  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:07:04):**  No, no, this is the price that farmers will get from, they don't get five euros a kilo,  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:07:10):**  they're going to be getting something like 150 to 250.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:07:14):**  There's actually a spot price for olive oil at the moment and the market of bulk price  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:07:19):**  that's a commodity that you could trade like frozen orange juice or pork bellies.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:07:25):**  And the price in Crete where a lot of our farmers is currently around three euros 10  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:07:30):**  per kilo and that's as recording in February.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:07:35):**  That's not necessarily what the farmer gets.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:07:38):**  The farmers are very, they're generally family farmers, they have small production, they  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:07:43):**  don't have a lot of market power.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:07:44):**  The market power belongs in the brokers in the cities, something like Iraq, Leon or Hanya.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:07:53):**  And then they will buy the olive oil from the mill or from the farmer and then that  
**[0:07:57-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:07:57):**  gets sold into the food system and it gets sold to blenders or to agribusinesses or to  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:08:06):**  brands themselves.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:08:08):**  And then they get stored, they get blended, it gets traded and eventually it'll find itself,  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:08:17):**  find its way after some period of storage.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:08:21):**  It goes into a container such as a five litre can or typically a half litre bottle.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:08:30):**  It then finds its way to a warehouse at the retailer or in our case it goes to what we  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:08:38):**  call a grossest, which is one of the companies like Transgourmet here in Switzerland that  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:08:44):**  sell directly to restaurants.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:08:46):**  So there's just five or six different levels.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:08:50):**  And then what would a bottle cost?  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:08:51):**  Like half a litre then, what would it cost?  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:08:54):**  So in the supermarket in Switzerland, you're looking at something like a price of 12 or  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:08:59):**  13 francs a litre, which is the same as US dollars.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:09:04):**  That's the average price for olive oil in a supermarket context.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:09:08):**  And for a restaurant, which is what we generally sell to, the price can vary between $8 a litre  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:09:16):**  up to around 15.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:09:19):**  And I'm scared to ask, what's the quality of this oil?  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:09:22):**  That's the problem.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:09:23):**  The quality just gets worse with every step.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:09:26):**  The product which comes out of the mill from the farmer is this pristine extra virgin product,  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:09:35):**  which is huge and hugely high in polyphenols and it's fresh.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:09:39):**  I don't know if you've ever seen fresh olive oil, but it has this amazing fluorescent green  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:09:45):**  color.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:09:46):**  It's one of the most, the smell is incredible.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:09:50):**  It's just a beautiful thing.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:09:53):**  At each step, it gets diluted, it gets mixed with other farmer's products.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:09:59):**  Sometimes it'll be stored in these tanks in Southern Italy with olive oil from the previous  
**[0:10:04-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:10:04):**  harvests.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:10:06):**  And so you lose all the terroir, you lose everything that made that oil unique.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:10:12):**  And to be honest, it's a terrible industry.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:10:15):**  This is not what consumers want.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:10:17):**  It's how the industry has evolved to fit the current food system.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:10:26):**  And all of these brands like Bertoli or Colavita or Monini, they all try to get olive oil,  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:10:35):**  which tastes the same each year and also was cheap enough for them to make a margin on  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:10:41):**  in the face of the supermarkets who were charging them vast marketing fees.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:10:47):**  And so they would blend it with inferior grades from Spain or from Tunisia, just so it met  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:10:56):**  the conditions for it to be extra virgin and wasn't better than that.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:02):**  And just for us dummies, what are the conditions for extra virgin?  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:06):**  It has to do with acidity, I think, right?  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:09):**  Or what are the conditions?  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:10):**  And of course there's a range and continuum as always.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:12):**  Yeah, so to be extra virgin, you have to have what's called free fatty acid content of 0.8%  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:20):**  or less.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:21):**  That's not acidity per se.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:23):**  This doesn't like citric acid or hydrochloric acid.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:26):**  It's a measure of the fruit quality at present.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:29):**  So 0.8.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:30):**  Yeah, 0.8 or below.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:32):**  And then it also has to pass the number of taste tests.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:35):**  So it can't have any taste defects.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:38):**  And then there are a bunch of other conditions to do with things like peroxide values or  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:42):**  wax content, but they're not particularly important.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:47):**  But the olive oil that comes out of one of our farmers has a free fatty acidity of 0.3  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:54):**  or 0.2.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:11:56):**  So if you only have to meet the criteria for 0.8, you can just mix it in with any old stuff.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:12:04):**  You can mix it in, I mean, a few years ago, they were using paraffin to bulk it up.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:12:09):**  And that's why it's one of the very interesting things that if you look at the statistics  
**[0:12:13-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:12:13):**  of production, something like there's a lot more extra virgin olive oil sold than is produced.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:12:21):**  Which means there's some really good quality produce, which is mixed up with others, blended  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:12:26):**  to get to 0.8 or 0.79.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:12:29):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:12:31):**  This is not what people want.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:12:33):**  People want to have the real stuff.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:12:35):**  So how did you go from that realization and of course, you're selling 70 litres here and  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:12:40):**  70 litres there and imagining that you could actually not take on this challenge because  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:12:45):**  you had to hire a lot of people and then you saw the internet or you saw this potentially  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:12:49):**  long tail distribution way.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:12:51):**  But it's still a very long step to then say, okay, I'm going to do this.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:12:56):**  Well, I knew that there was demand for it because of the experience that me and my wife  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:01):**  have had with our friends.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:04):**  You take a three litre tin of olive oil and you say, and our friends would say, could  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:12):**  you have any more of that wonderful olive oil?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:14):**  And we'd say, yes, we have a three litre tin and they would go, oh no, we'll never use  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:18):**  three litres.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:19):**  Do you have anything smaller?  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:20):**  And we would say, no.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:21):**  I'm laughing because we're doing a bit the same with some olive oil from friends in Southern  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:25):**  Italy and we're selling only five litres.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:27):**  And it was a lot of convincing, but after the first year that you're going to say exactly  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:31):**  the same people get used to it.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:32):**  And suddenly it's like, can we order two?  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:34):**  Well, of course we finished it in a year.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:37):**  Having a really good high quality extra virgin olive oil in vast quantities in your kitchen  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:43):**  changes the way you cook forever.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:46):**  Once you've done it, it's very, very hard to go back.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:50):**  And it's very, very hard to go back to the supermarket oil that you used before.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:13:57):**  We have, I mean, our company's three years old and all of the big restaurants, all the  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:04):**  restaurant clients that were taking our product on a regular basis, they're still with us.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:09):**  We've never really lost a client.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:11):**  We lost one client.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:13):**  That's because his uncle started producing olive oil and he was obliged to take that  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:17):**  one.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:18):**  But we haven't had any customer churn.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:20):**  It's an incredibly sticky, incredibly addictive product.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:25):**  And so I know, I knew that there was this demand.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:30):**  We'd done the testing for it.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:33):**  And so for me, it hasn't really been that higher high risk venture because I had that  
**[0:14:41-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:41):**  background.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:43):**  What actually happened to us is that we started trying to sell direct to consumer on a B2C  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:51):**  basis.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:52):**  And that actually turns out to be a lot harder than we thought.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:14:57):**  There's a lot of money that you have to spend that we didn't have on the digital side.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:15:02):**  And one of the things that customers don't, if you haven't used very high quality olive  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:15:08):**  oil before to be confronted with a three or five liter container is off putting.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:15:14):**  You need to be able to taste it.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:15:17):**  So there was something offline we needed to add to the online experience.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:15:24):**  And we were struggling with that a little bit, but then we started selling to restaurants  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:15:32):**  at the same time, more of the sort of a side hustle.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:15:36):**  This actually started taking over.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:15:38):**  And now three years after we started the business, something like 90% of our volume is B2B selling  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:15:46):**  to restaurants.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:15:49):**  And are they very different in a sense that they are there also a nice channel?  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:15:53):**  And maybe the answer is no, because 90% goes to the restaurants, but do that customers,  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:15:57):**  the end customer on their table ends up seeing your name as well, or a lot of the time they  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:02):**  do see our bottles.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:04):**  We have some relatively nicely designed bottles that we use.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:09):**  And very often the, the restaurants in more and more, one of the trends in restaurants  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:15):**  is listing your ingredients.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:18):**  And so we have a couple of restaurants that put us on the menu and say olive oil from  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:22):**  Amphora.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:23):**  In Switzerland, you have to put the origin of your meat, the country of origin, but now  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:30):**  they're sticking their sickness at the bottom of the menu saying, or, you know, meat from  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:34):**  a chicken from Switzerland, olive oil by Amphora.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:39):**  Which helps.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:40):**  Yeah, it does.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:41):**  It does for us though.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:42):**  So the real, I mean, we started off trying to be very digital and very direct to consumer,  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:49):**  but what's actually happened is that we've become more boots on the ground.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:53):**  We have a small sales force with three amazing sales dudes.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:16:58):**  And what we do is we go to restaurants.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:01):**  We have 10 farmers on the platform now with 14 different olive oils.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:06):**  We take four or five with us, the chef or the restaurant sits there, both of them sit  
**[0:17:14-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:14):**  there and taste it.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:15):**  They discuss it between each other, all the different flavors.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:20):**  And we, you know, they, then they buy it then and there that's become the new go to market.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:26):**  And then they keep being, do they stay then with that farmer?  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:30):**  Because you mentioned before that relationship between the restaurant and the farmer, they  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:33):**  become intertwined.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:34):**  Oh, completely, completely, completely intertwined.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:35):**  Oh, completely, completely, completely.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:37):**  They totally stay with those farmers.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:39):**  They get very upset if we sell out of that particular olive oil and they start to complain  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:45):**  if we bring another different olive oil, because what they realize that these tastings Coon  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:50):**  is that olive oil, it's like wine.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:53):**  There are so many different flavors.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:17:55):**  There are so many different characteristics from the country, from the region, from the  
**[0:18:02-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:02):**  soil, from the way that the farmers create their olive oil, the methods of cultivation.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:10):**  And so there's a moment in their eyes when they taste a real fresh extra virgin olive  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:18):**  oil from the latest harvest.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:20):**  They haven't had that before.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:22):**  And then the other moment, which is very nice is when they, it's a bit like a dating app  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:28):**  is when they find their olive oil.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:30):**  And that's the one that they use.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:32):**  That's the one that they stick with.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:33):**  And are they okay with that?  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:35):**  Because the flavor, just like in wine can be different in different years.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:39):**  Like do they stick with that flavor even if it changes because climate was different that  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:43):**  year or they will move with, do they get updates as well from the farmer?  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:47):**  Like do they live through the season somehow?  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:50):**  Is it something you facilitate or they know, okay, now in January the new oil is coming  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:55):**  and it's a...  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:57):**  Chefs tend to be very busy.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:18:59):**  Because they have a product which they like and trust, they don't spend any more brain  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:19:03):**  time on it.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:19:05):**  And so, you know, they, chefs take a, if it isn't broken, don't fix it type attitude.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:19:11):**  And for them, like the price, how is the price different from what they maybe get at a, I  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:19:18):**  think a wholesaler or whatever they got their oil from before.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:19:21):**  Is the price an issue or is that also, is it actually because you cut away all these  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:19:26):**  decommodified processes in the middle, is that approachable for them or do they have  
**[0:19:30-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:19:30):**  to be?  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:19:31):**  Okay, this is like a very interesting wine, but there's also an interesting price tag.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:19:35):**  This is the core of our business model.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:19:36):**  And this is the core of the innovation that we've discovered, I think.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:19:42):**  But if you cut out all of these different levels, each of those different levels are  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:19:48):**  earning a 30% gross margin.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:19:51):**  Basically that's the minimum for these companies to work.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:19:55):**  And to take away all that value extracted by the food chain and the ecosystem, and to  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:20:03):**  share it between the customer and the farmer.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:20:08):**  And obviously for ourselves a little bit, this is the innovation.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:20:12):**  This is what we're doing, which is completely different.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:20:15):**  And so the beauty of our model is that we can pay our farmers two times what they can  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:20:22):**  get in the market.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:20:25):**  So our prices for farmers vary between 450 per kilo to 750 per kilo.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:20:33):**  And that depends on the polyphenol content, the nutrient densities, the acidities, and  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:20:41):**  how regenerative that farmer is.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:20:45):**  Does he use pesticides?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:20:47):**  Does he use synthetic fertilizers?  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:20:50):**  Does he use herbicides?  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:20:51):**  Does he keep lovely ground cover?  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:20:52):**  Has he got a fully biodiverse olive grove?  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:20:58):**  So the farmers are incredibly pleased.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:21:02):**  And then the price point that we can offer to our customers starts at $10 a liter.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:21:11):**  And that's typically what they're paying.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:21:15):**  Sometimes they're paying a little bit less, but we offer a 10 times better quality.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:21:23):**  That's why we've had so much success.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:21:24):**  That's why, I mean, we've been working in Zurich for one year so far.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:21:30):**  The market size in Zurich for B2B olive oil we think is around $25 to $30 million.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:21:43):**  And in that one year, half of which was taken up with the pandemic and restaurants were  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:21:51):**  closed.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:21:52):**  Not the easiest year for a restaurant.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:21:54):**  We still made what?  
**[0:21:55-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:21:55):**  We gained 1% market share.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:21:57):**  And that's with an understaffed sales team.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:01):**  That's with the pandemic when the restaurants are closed and all the chefs are terrified  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:05):**  that they're going to have to shut their restaurant.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:07):**  The last thing they want to do is take on new ingredient vendors.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:12):**  Of course.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:13):**  So once you get into this business and once those restauranteurs see the pricing and the  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:19):**  quality, it's pretty compelling.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:21):**  And how does it arrive to them?  
**[0:22:22-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:22):**  Because I mentioned in the intro the zero waste reusable containers.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:25):**  Let's spend a bit of time on that.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:27):**  What's, it's not going to arrive in half a liter bottles, I think.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:30):**  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:32):**  So we buy in bulk and deliver in bulk.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:34):**  So our first iteration was as a B2C direct to consumer company.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:41):**  And we use these stainless steel containers of three liters and five liters.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:48):**  And they're quite expensive and we would refill them.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:51):**  We would come to your house, but we still do this with many of our B2C customers.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:55):**  We come to the house and then we refill those containers.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:22:58):**  So you don't need, you know, a five liter container is 10 glass, half liter bottles  
**[0:23:03-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:03):**  that don't need to be created, which uses up tons of resources or recycled.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:11):**  Pretty secret Coon.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:12):**  Did you know that when you recycle a glass bottle, it doesn't actually go back into other  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:17):**  glass bottles.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:18):**  Only 20% of it does.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:20):**  Most of it becomes building material.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:23):**  It's down-cycled.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:24):**  Anyway, but when we got into our B2B business, they want big volume.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:31):**  And so we deliver to our customers on the B2B side, a 17 liter tin plate container with  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:38):**  a pump.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:40):**  And that 10 plate container, unfortunately we cannot reuse.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:44):**  It needs to be recycled.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:47):**  The good thing about recycling metal is that it can go back into metal.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:52):**  We're actually sort of working on trying to find a solution for that to make a fully reusable  
**[0:23:56-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:56):**  container.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:23:58):**  But right now we're just trying to keep up with demand and also dealing with all the  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:24:04):**  farmers that are trying to get onto our platform.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:24:07):**  And speaking more about it, what's been the growth on the farmer side?  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:24:12):**  I mean, I know the issues in Italy around abandoned olive groves, about the economics  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:24:18):**  that if you're too small, like I mentioned in intro, you just don't have access to export  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:24:22):**  to the interesting markets.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:24:23):**  You're completely left to the brokers, which are not in your interest.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:24:27):**  And how has been the impact of them working with you in this venture, apart from the much  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:24:33):**  better price?  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:24:34):**  What's the effect that you see that these prices have on these communities and on the  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:24:38):**  farmers?  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:24:39):**  The effect can be very big.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:24:40):**  And a lot of our farmers have started small and have actually, since they've been on our  
**[0:24:48-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:24:48):**  platform, they've massively expanded the number of trees they have under management.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:24:55):**  We have a farmer in Northern Crete, a place called Toolati, Yorgos, great guy.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:02):**  The year after he started on our platform, he told me that he's going to get rid of his  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:07):**  restaurant and become a full-time olive farmer, which sort of freaked me out, to be honest.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:13):**  Because now you're responsible for him.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:17):**  We visit them every year.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:18):**  We visit our farmers every year and we stay in touch with them and we tell them everything  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:21):**  that's going on and who's using their product.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:24):**  And I think they appreciate that.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:27):**  And he's become a full-time olive farmer.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:29):**  He's tripled the number of trees that he has.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:32):**  His neighbors are often generally older people.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:36):**  They come to him and say, Yorgos, I'm too old to look after my trees.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:40):**  Please, can you take them and look after them for me and you can use the oil.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:46):**  It's the right, I just need to know that they're being looked after.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:50):**  And he has to send them away now.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:52):**  And so it's been transformative for our farmers.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:25:57):**  They become so much more involved in their – they start attending seminars and start  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:04):**  studying agronomy.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:06):**  And they become as interested in We Are – this is a Regenerative Agriculture podcast, we  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:11):**  should probably talk about –  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:12):**  It's going to be my next question.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:15):**  They become so much more interested in going back to what olive farming used to be before  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:22):**  the sort of extractive agricultural revolution.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:26):**  When they drop the pesticides, they drop the synthetic fertilizers.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:31):**  Because is that clear connection also there in olive oil between, let's say, the management  
**[0:26:36-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:36):**  practices on the ground?  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:38):**  Because you mentioned very specifically, we pay for basically quality.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:41):**  We pay for this and this levels, the price ranges depending on the quality.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:47):**  Have you seen that super clear connection or not super clear, or so clear connection  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:50):**  between soil and quality of the olive oil?  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:54):**  I would like to say yes.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:26:58):**  It's still quite early.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:27:00):**  We've been around for three years now.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:27:03):**  So this will be our fourth harvest.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:27:07):**  And the farmers who have been with us for a while, they have gone more regenerative.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:27:17):**  But each year can be different.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:27:18):**  So the way we measure nutrient density in olive oil is through polyphenol content.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:27:25):**  That does, I'd like to say there was a very clear trend.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:27:29):**  But we didn't really measure polyphenol content in the first year.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:27:33):**  But there's a secret sort of level of olive oil.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:27:36):**  There's a secret beyond extra virgin.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:27:40):**  There's actually a designation of olive oil that's very underused by the industry, which  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:27:44):**  is called high polyphenol olive oil.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:27:47):**  If you, this is under the 2012 European Commission or European law passed by parliament, which  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:27:56):**  allows olive oil bottles to contain a health claim on the back of it.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:28:02):**  And to qualify for that, it's to be high polyphenol olive oil.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:28:08):**  Listeners can't see me doing my air quotes.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:28:13):**  And to get that, you have to have polyphenol levels of above 250 milligrams per kilo.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:28:20):**  And so to like last year was the first year we made it obligatory for all of our farmers  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:28:26):**  to do that polyphenol test.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:28:28):**  And I think 13 out of our 14 oils turned out to be high polyphenol.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:28:35):**  The top polyphenol level for one of our oils was 780 milligrams per kilo.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:28:43):**  Now I have heard of other farmers and other olive oils having levels of 1000 plus.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:28:51):**  Can we get in that food as medicine range then?  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:28:54):**  Or what's the more the better in this case?  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:28:56):**  Oh, yeah, for sure.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:28:58):**  The more the better, the more the better.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:00):**  So those are the downsides of high polyphenols, which can have an association with a more  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:05):**  bitter taste.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:07):**  And so it's a balance.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:09):**  Our restaurateurs, they sometimes get very frightened of having very bitter olive oils.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:16):**  But we try to have sort of maximise polyphenol levels while also having sort of crowd pleasing  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:22):**  taste profiles.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:23):**  Flavour.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:25):**  But the flavour, I mean, the flavour profile has changed in olive oil as well, because  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:29):**  extra virgin wasn't there too much.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:31):**  I mean, it wasn't harvested on the tree.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:33):**  It was full.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:34):**  So the flavour profile, I mean, changes over time.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:37):**  It's not that but of course, you don't want to scare your guests away because of a super  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:42):**  bitter flavour, even though it's it might be I mean, many of you sell this medicine,  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:47):**  people are accept certain flavours.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:48):**  But  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:49):**  yeah, I mean, they are olive oils.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:51):**  So many of our restaurants are now taking different olive oil.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:29:54):**  So one of them will take an olive oil to cook with and then another will take another olive  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:30:00):**  oil in our range for maybe the salad bar.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:30:04):**  And there you can have a higher end, more polyphenol rich, bitter olive oil.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:30:12):**  But that really to go back to your original question, we think we will see from farmers,  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:30:20):**  where we're measuring nutrient density consistently, higher polyphenol levels over time.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:30:26):**  But then again, each year is going to be very different, you're going to have to do rolling  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:30:30):**  averages basically to see the trend.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:30:34):**  And so what is exciting, let's say on the agronomy part or on the land part, how would  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:30:39):**  you like when it's saying how would you like to see the land change but bring us to because  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:30:44):**  obviously we're an audio so visual tour of an olive grove that of one of your farmers  
**[0:30:49-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:30:49):**  that you're proud of.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:30:50):**  And then let's also think, okay, what could be improved there?  
**[0:30:53-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:30:53):**  What could be complexified, etc, etc?  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:30:56):**  What is out there in the future to bring more regenerative practices to these growths?  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:31:00):**  So you have to look at the olive oil industry as a whole.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:31:05):**  Most olive oil doesn't need a lot of inputs.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:31:08):**  There has been a fashion in the past for farmers to reduce ground cover, and to basically plow  
**[0:31:15-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:31:15):**  up everything.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:31:16):**  And so if you're driving through the Mediterranean, sometimes you'll see some olive groves, which  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:31:21):**  are green between the trees which are grass.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:31:24):**  And sometimes you'll see other olive groves with where the ground cover has been removed,  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:31:30):**  and you just see the soil underneath.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:31:32):**  We're very much pro green.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:31:35):**  For us, the ideal olive grove is this wonderful, bi-diverse sort of plot.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:31:43):**  It'll change color during the year, and during winter and spring, it'll be extremely green.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:31:48):**  It'll be sort of more yellow and brown, but it'll have a lot of shrubs.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:31:53):**  It'll have a lot of herbs, sage and oregano and thyme.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:00):**  It'll be interspersed with different tree species.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:05):**  And when you see a lot of our farmers are very old, they have very old growth trees.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:12):**  One of our farmers in northern Greece, he claims that his trees are planted in the era  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:17):**  of Emperor Justinian.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:19):**  But his family don't actually believe that, and they always laugh at him when he says  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:23):**  that.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:24):**  But anyway.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:25):**  olive trees can get very old.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:26):**  Oh, for sure.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:27):**  But you go back to the times when these trees are planted, and you were doing real forest  
**[0:32:32-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:32):**  agronomy.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:33):**  You would have olive trees interspersed with carob trees, interspersed with nut trees,  
**[0:32:40-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:40):**  interspersed with fruit trees interspersed.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:43):**  Fruit would be pomegranates.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:44):**  Or figs.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:45):**  Or figs or something like that.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:47):**  Well, figs, not so much.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:48):**  They just grow wherever you go.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:51):**  So you have this wonderful, bi-diverse growth with great tree spacing.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:56):**  Tree spacing is key.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:32:57):**  So you'd have five to six meters between each tree.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:33:03):**  They didn't have pesticides.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:33:04):**  They didn't have all of the things and herbicides which farmers have available now, back when  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:33:11):**  these things are planted.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:33:12):**  And so this is how they control pests.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:33:15):**  And this is how people in part of the regenerative ag movement are realizing that's what we've  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:33:22):**  been missing in the past 50 years.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:33:25):**  So would that mean if you take like a relatively modern growth, which many olive groves you  
**[0:33:31-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:33:31):**  see are relatively monoculturists, like they're like perfect lines, maybe even cut like everything  
**[0:33:38-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:33:38):**  cut underneath.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:33:39):**  If you would regenerate that, it means you take out a number of trees, you put in other  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:33:44):**  species, you make sure the ground is covered, you decrease this tree number per hectare  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:33:49):**  or per just you to create space and diversity.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:33:53):**  Or is it very difficult to take a monoculture olive grove and regenerate it in general?  
**[0:33:59-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:33:59):**  Should you start over?  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:00):**  So far, the movement has just been one way from traditional to what people call high  
**[0:34:06-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:06):**  density and super high density farming.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:09):**  This hasn't happened in the places where we have our farmers, which is mostly Greece.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:14):**  It's been something that's definitely happened in Spain.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:17):**  So it is a one way trip.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:19):**  Once you have pulled out all the old growth trees and replaced them with a high density  
**[0:34:25-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:25):**  growth, a high density growth here is where you have tree distances of one meter or less.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:34):**  The trees are trimmed at the top and pruned by machines every year by over the top machines.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:41):**  They're basically kept as shrubs.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:43):**  They're kept as shrubs.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:44):**  They're the smallest trees to shrubs to bushes.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:48):**  But now I think you have some quite big over the top machines so they can do these things.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:54):**  But this is the soil can't support these trees.  
**[0:34:57-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:57):**  You need to use additives.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:34:59):**  You need to use input.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:01):**  You need fertilizer and doesn't have to be synthetic.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:04):**  You can now go to organic fertilizers.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:07):**  But still it's an input.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:09):**  It's an input and you have to goose those trees.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:12):**  You need to support the soil because the soil is being exhausted every year by those trees.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:18):**  And you also have huge pest problems.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:20):**  Because if you're an olive fly, this is like someone, it's heaven.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:26):**  It's like a wonderful holiday home bungalows for olive flies.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:32):**  And so you need to have quite intense pest control issues.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:37):**  And there are ways of doing it without pesticides.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:41):**  But I think they're generally quite expensive.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:45):**  But this is a form of agriculture of olive cultivation which took off since the 1990s.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:49):**  So it's relatively new.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:52):**  Something like 30% of all of the olive oil production, global olive oil production comes  
**[0:35:58-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:58):**  from these high density groves now.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:35:59):**  And it's growing every year.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:36:01):**  This has a number of effects for my farmers, for our farmers, for the traditional farmers,  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:36:06):**  especially the ones who are not on the angfir platform.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:36:09):**  Because it creates a huge amount of price pressure.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:36:12):**  And those farmers are also exposed to these global or regional stock prices.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:36:18):**  They are affected by global supply and demand.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:36:21):**  And when you have these, I mean, super high density growth is an efficiency gain of two  
**[0:36:29-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:36:29):**  to three to four times your breakeven price point drops from 3,350 in a traditional growth,  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:36:40):**  three euros 50 per kilo to 150 to 170.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:36:46):**  Which means a lot of groves are being abandoned.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:36:49):**  I mean, it's not that you, they're not in the easiest places.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:36:52):**  It's not that you cut very easily and plant something else in many cases, or you do, but  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:36:58):**  there's two things happening.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:36:59):**  One is groves are being abandoned as farmers age.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:37:02):**  They can't get the labor anymore, especially in areas of Europe where the rural population  
**[0:37:09-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:37:09):**  has basically left.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:37:11):**  But the other thing that's happening is that the younger farmers have a choice to make.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:37:17):**  Are they going to carry on struggling or are they going to join the high density revolution?  
**[0:37:24-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:37:24):**  And they rip up their trees, the old growth trees, and plant the new high density growth.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:37:31):**  It's happened a lot in Portugal recently.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:37:34):**  There was a new dam that has been built in the first decade of the century and it's allowed  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:37:43):**  huge intensification of olive production.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:37:47):**  There was, you've created this huge source of irrigation.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:37:49):**  Because you need the irrigation.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:37:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:37:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:37:52):**  I mean, that's the other thing.  
**[0:37:53-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:37:53):**  Once you have 2000 trees per hectare instead of 500 trees per hectare, suddenly the water  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:01):**  demands become much higher.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:03):**  So then you're going to need to do full irrigation schemes.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:06):**  It's much more capital intensive.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:08):**  And this is why in Spain, which is where most of this high density stuff is, and Iberia  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:14):**  where most of this high density stuff has happened, you have so much water stress in  
**[0:38:19-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:19):**  Southern Spain.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:21):**  One of the contributing factors is not just olive oil.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:23):**  One of the reasons, yeah.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:26):**  And you mentioned there's no, for many places, there's simply the age of the farmer as well  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:31):**  and probably is not going to choose to, is either going to sell off or it's not going  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:35):**  to choose to rip up everything, et cetera, because there's 70 or 65, et cetera.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:39):**  But the fact that they cannot find or cannot find a labor, does the fact that somebody  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:44):**  like you or other platforms pay so much better, does it allow you to then find labor or because  
**[0:38:49-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:49):**  there's nobody left anymore anyway, even if you pay double or pay whatever, it's not,  
**[0:38:55-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:55):**  you don't find the hands to do the work.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:38:57):**  Is this a fix for that or we need more to get people back to the land?  
**[0:39:03-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:39:03):**  So yeah, they're allowed, you know, if you're getting prices of five, six euros per kilo,  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:39:11):**  then you can typically afford migrant labor.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:39:16):**  Most of the labor comes from kids from Bulgaria and Romania and Eastern Europe who go to Greece  
**[0:39:25-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:39:25):**  during the winter months.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:39:27):**  And you know, that's generally the guys who are doing the picking for you.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:39:34):**  And so, yeah, you can pay for that.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:39:36):**  And so it restarts and you can pay for the mill and you can pay for a lot of other things  
**[0:39:42-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:39:42):**  obviously locally in the community.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:39:44):**  Yeah, what really marks out olive cultivation as opposed to other agricultural commodities  
**[0:39:53-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:39:53):**  or markets is that it's, while it's intensifying and you have these sort of, I would say dark  
**[0:40:00-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:40:00):**  forces of the high density groups beginning to spread, it's traditional, it hasn't changed.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:40:11):**  It hasn't changed much.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:40:12):**  Yes, you using pesticides, yes, using a little bit of herbicides, yes, you're using a little  
**[0:40:17-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:40:17):**  bit of synthetic fertilizers in some cases, but the amounts are very, very small.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:40:23):**  So it's still mostly traditional, but it just can't compete.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:40:30):**  Do you see that changing with technology or with other things like, is that, I mean, in  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:40:35):**  terms of harvesting, if the hands are difficult to find or processing, like what's on the  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:40:40):**  horizon to harvest these old trees and to get amazing olive oil if we don't get the  
**[0:40:46-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:40:46):**  hands from Bulgaria basically?  
**[0:40:49-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:40:49):**  Or is there anything happening there, things you've seen or is it mostly in the high intensive  
**[0:40:54-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:40:54):**  ones?  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:40:55):**  No, there is no, these are low technology methods of production.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:41:01):**  Some years ago they started using sort of rotating tools to knock the olives out of  
**[0:41:08-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:41:08):**  the trees.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:41:10):**  Some of our farmers still use sticks to bang the branches of the trees and the olives fall  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:41:16):**  down and they all go into nets and there is actually quite a wonderful thing to do to  
**[0:41:22-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:41:22):**  be there at the olive harvest.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:41:25):**  It's a lot of hard work and the head of the family climbs the tree, he hits it with a  
**[0:41:31-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:41:31):**  stick and the women and any foreign in-laws that happen to be around are not trusted to  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:41:43):**  hit the trees with a stick.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:41:44):**  So when I've been in my wife's family, I help with the nets and I do the sort of the sorting.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:41:51):**  It's still very much a sort of a friends and family affair.  
**[0:41:56-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:41:56):**  Farmers do not have capital.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:41:59):**  They're small farmers.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:42:00):**  They have 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 trees and beyond that you're in a sort of an SME type context  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:42:09):**  and even then they don't have capital.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:42:11):**  So, and it's still very traditional but those practices just create a better olive oil.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:42:21):**  But there are also all these other benefits for it.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:42:23):**  I mean these communities can continue.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:42:27):**  Those rural communities, I mean one of the things that I love about the Regen Ag movement  
**[0:42:32-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:42:32):**  is that it's not just about soil.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:42:35):**  It's really about the people who live on the soil.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:42:39):**  It's the farmers, it's these rural communities and those rural communities are the repository  
**[0:42:44-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:42:44):**  of culture, of tradition, of history and all of the countryside that we go on holiday to  
**[0:42:54-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:42:54):**  enjoy.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:42:57):**  These farmers, they deserve support because it's like they have positive, they create  
**[0:43:06-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:43:06):**  positive externalities if you see what I mean.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:43:09):**  The countryside that we enjoy plus, apart from the food obviously, the clean air and  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:43:15):**  biodiversity and so much more.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:43:18):**  And it's a carbon sink.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:43:21):**  The Mediterranean, it doesn't have high levels of soil carbon as opposed to sort of areas  
**[0:43:29-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:43:29):**  such as the US Midwest or the steppes of Ukraine, the great wheat baskets.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:43:37):**  Soil carbon is generally around 2.5%, it's dry.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:43:44):**  But those olive trees which are literally everywhere when you travel through the Mediterranean,  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:43:50):**  they're what, they're the carbon sink of the area.  
**[0:43:56-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:43:56):**  But not only do they have a carbon sink, they do everything.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:43:59):**  That's the source of the biodiversity, this agroforestry.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:44:04):**  That's what holds the land together.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:44:06):**  Quite literally.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:44:07):**  Yeah, literally without those trees, I mean, you have this huge and their root networks,  
**[0:44:13-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:44:13):**  you have huge problems of erosion and everything needs to be maintained.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:44:19):**  You're seeing a lot of farms, a lot of small holdings become abandoned.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:44:23):**  I see this in my wife's village when we go there.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:44:26):**  A lot of the families, they're dying out.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:44:30):**  There's fewer and fewer old people, the old people to the left can't look after the trees  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:44:33):**  anymore and the kids are all in Athens being a cantons.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:44:39):**  And so, that's a fate which we can't, which we need to avoid.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:44:45):**  And so what would you tell investors that are listening and think, I'm interested in  
**[0:44:50-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:44:50):**  the Mediterranean, I'm potentially from there, I'm very interested to put money to work.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:44:59):**  What would you, obviously without giving investment advice, but what would you tell them where  
**[0:45:02-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:02):**  to dig?  
**[0:45:03-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:03):**  Is it the olive is the key, let's say the keystone species here, is that to dig deeper  
**[0:45:09-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:09):**  there and there to understand the olive industry?  
**[0:45:12-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:12):**  Is that really, let's say for this region around this massive sea, the Mediterranean  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:17):**  Sea, what would you say, go deep into the olive oil because that's the key one to keep  
**[0:45:21-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:21):**  it alive?  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:23):**  Olive oil is a $10 billion global retail market.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:28):**  So it's quite big.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:30):**  It's probably the biggest single sort of agricultural commodity in those areas.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:37):**  But there's also a lot of others.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:39):**  So there's a lot of different things you can do in the land.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:42):**  I mean, you go to Greece and you throw a tomato into your garden and you come back and you  
**[0:45:47-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:47):**  spend six months time when there's a tomato bush.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:50):**  It's incredibly sunny, fertile soils.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:45:55):**  But at the heart of all of these is the olive tree.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:46:00):**  If you are trying to make an impact with your money, I think that's the place to start.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:46:07):**  But what complicates the picture is the trees are already there.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:46:14):**  They don't need capital.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:46:17):**  What these communities need is to become part of the global economy, to become part of the  
**[0:46:24-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:46:24):**  food system, and to be connected to markets that are able to pay the fair price for their  
**[0:46:32-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:46:32):**  products.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:46:33):**  We talk about the positive externalities that they create.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:46:35):**  It's the opposite of, people always complain about the meat industry, that it's too cheap  
**[0:46:43-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:46:43):**  and it costs so much more.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:46:47):**  With olive oil and the farmers, the ones that are on the Amfora platform, but the ones who  
**[0:46:53-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:46:53):**  we can't bring onto the platform yet, they create so much more value than they're getting.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:01):**  And so the opportunity for an investor, I would think, is, and this is what we've identified  
**[0:47:09-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:09):**  as well.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:11):**  I've spent 25 years as a tech investor.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:16):**  That's the opportunity to bring those products to market because what customers are getting  
**[0:47:23-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:23):**  right now in the end market is not what they want.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:26):**  It's not what they pay for.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:29):**  The opportunity is to bring it directly.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:32):**  And so the opportunity, the place people should be investing in is scrunching those supply  
**[0:47:38-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:38):**  chains together, making them short.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:41):**  That's where the technology comes in.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:42):**  And that's where we talk about the technology is on the consumer side, the technology and  
**[0:47:45-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:45):**  the marketing.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:47):**  It's bringing those products to market and allowing those farmers to get a fair price.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:52):**  We are creating the scale for those farmers that they don't have.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:47:59):**  Would you do that?  
**[0:48:00-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:00):**  Like, let's flip the question.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:01):**  You would be an investor on the other side of the table with a billion dollars or billion  
**[0:48:05-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:05):**  euros billion Swiss Franc.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:07):**  I don't care.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:08):**  A lot of money.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:09):**  What would you do?  
**[0:48:10-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:10):**  Would you make a thousand on for us, which you in different categories, which you invest  
**[0:48:13-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:13):**  everything in these models to radically shorten the supply chain?  
**[0:48:19-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:19):**  Or would you do something completely different?  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:21):**  I think that's I've been an avid listener of your podcast, Coon.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:27):**  And I know that's a question that I had to prepare.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:32):**  And that is exactly what I would do.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:33):**  I mean, that's what regenerative agriculture needs.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:37):**  If you look at extractive agriculture, it's got this huge ecosystem supporting it.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:43):**  The supermarkets, the agribusinesses, Nestle's and those giant capital rich factories that  
**[0:48:50-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:50):**  have built up to process those foods and turn them into packaged long life things that the  
**[0:48:58-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:48:58):**  supermarket can stop for months and months and months.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:49:02):**  And then you have the marketing side.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:49:03):**  You have, you know, pictures of the babies eating yogurts and happy families and.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:49:10):**  Grandmothers making this, the tomato sauce or harvesting the olives of Bertolli.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:49:15):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:49:18):**  And so this is what has enabled, this is what has grown up and around the extractive agricultural  
**[0:49:25-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:49:25):**  ecosystem.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:49:26):**  And we need to create something like that for regenerative agriculture, but it's going  
**[0:49:32-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:49:32):**  to come because the demand is there and you see some small companies starting up and you  
**[0:49:39-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:49:39):**  see larger companies trying to do it themselves.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:49:43):**  You know, it's what I think a thousand amforus would be wonderful, but a thousand amforus  
**[0:49:50-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:49:50):**  not just for olive oil, but all those regenerative cattle farmers out in the Midwest, they, their  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:49:57):**  biggest problem is finding a market slaughter.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:01):**  We just had, I don't know if it's going to be out when this is out.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:04):**  It depends a bit on our release schedule.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:06):**  We just had a check-in interview with Dan Miller of Stewart and they're financing a  
**[0:50:09-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:09):**  lot of mobile or modular slaughter facilities for ranchers that are getting together to  
**[0:50:15-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:15):**  own their own slaughter facilities, because that's been their biggest issue to not have  
**[0:50:20-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:20):**  access even because they're massive facilities, heavily centralised and you cannot get in.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:25):**  And of course, when you get in, let's say the quality as an understatement is horrific  
**[0:50:30-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:30):**  what you get out and they are starting to get together.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:32):**  And they used to be, of course, co-op owned and now we have different structures to own  
**[0:50:36-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:36):**  that, but to re-own that piece of the supply chain and they need it because they're not  
**[0:50:40-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:40):**  getting the cuts they want to send to the chefs.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:42):**  They're not getting the access even to slaughtering.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:45):**  And it's a huge investment opportunity.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:46):**  I totally get it.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:48):**  And then the abattoirs is one thing, but then they need to get it to the farmers.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:52):**  I mean, so the customers, the customers need access to that.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:50:57):**  And once that can be set up, and so it's actually quite easy to do it.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:01):**  The first step is to restaurants.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:03):**  The first step is to, is B2B.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:06):**  And this is how I think we can, we can work at Amphora.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:11):**  Something like if you look at that 10 billion global market, something like 60% of it is  
**[0:51:18-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:18):**  the consumer space.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:20):**  And 40% is B2B is restaurants.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:23):**  And but the B2B, the restaurants, there's so much easier to address, especially don't  
**[0:51:27-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:27):**  have the capital.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:28):**  And right now we're growing very, very quickly at the last.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:33):**  Luckily, restaurants are open again.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:35):**  Restaurants are open again, but even if, yeah, but we're, we're at a very early stage of  
**[0:51:39-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:39):**  our business, so it's a bit cheating.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:41):**  So we have these incredibly high growth rates, but it's also easier to address this market.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:49):**  And those customers buy in bulk, buy a lot of stuff.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:52):**  So our plan is to start with the restaurants, but then at a certain point go back to our  
**[0:51:56-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:51:56):**  original zero waste solution, which is creating a network of people taking olive oil to people's  
**[0:52:04-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:04):**  house and selling it in bulk, like a milkman.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:09):**  And that's the funny thing because, you know, people could say, this will never work.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:12):**  This is a stupid thing.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:14):**  This is...  
**[0:52:15-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:15):**  But we've done it.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:17):**  But we've done it.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:18):**  It did work.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:19):**  It works the way things were done before, before industrial scale agriculture.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:25):**  We know that it works.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:27):**  It's just, we have to relearn and resee it sort of, because none of us has sort of actively,  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:34):**  maybe lived it for just a bit, but not actively enough in terms to see the numbers or to see  
**[0:52:39-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:39):**  that it could actually financially work.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:42):**  And we're, yeah, we're rediscovering a lot of things, both on the agriculture and agronom  
**[0:52:45-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:45):**  side, but definitely also on the distribution side.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:48):**  Right.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:49):**  And the thing that underlies the whole of the industrial extractive agriculture space  
**[0:52:56-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:56):**  is government action.  
**[0:52:57-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:52:58):**  That actually gets to my final question.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:01):**  Magic wand.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:02):**  What would you do?  
**[0:53:03-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:03):**  I mean, you know this one is coming, but if there was one thing you could change, what  
**[0:53:05-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:05):**  would you do with the magic wand?  
**[0:53:06-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:06):**  I would magic up at that distribution.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:10):**  I would ask the genie or no, I have a magic wand.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:13):**  So I would have to create...  
**[0:53:15-0:53:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:15):**  You're the genie.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:17):**  I would have to create an infrastructure, the distribution infrastructure for the regenerative  
**[0:53:22-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:22):**  agricultural community.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:24):**  That's what I would do.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:26):**  But that's going to be very complicated.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:29):**  I don't think that's for any one person to design.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:33):**  It's going to have to come through evolution.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:36):**  Because then it becomes centralized again.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:39):**  So I have to go to the question.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:41):**  So I'd have to answer the question in a way that probably is a little bit boring, but  
**[0:53:45-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:45):**  I would shift government subsidies away from production and into consumption.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:50):**  How would it look like?  
**[0:53:51-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:51):**  That would look like possibly...  
**[0:53:53-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:53:53):**  I mean, people have been talking about a minimum basic income for a while, and maybe that's  
**[0:54:00-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:54:00):**  something which is inevitable.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:54:03):**  But I think a first step could be when you have on a food stamp program or some government  
**[0:54:10-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:54:10):**  support could come out of supporting farmers and go in into helping people consume better  
**[0:54:20-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:54:20):**  food.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:54:22):**  I mean, the market is there, but the gate created and it's a very important point, which  
**[0:54:27-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:54:27):**  we're going to capture for another, we're going to have for another one, but to have  
**[0:54:30-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:54:30):**  it accessible, not just for the ones that can pay it now, that already goes to the farmers  
**[0:54:34-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:54:34):**  market already get, okay, maybe not perfect, but good stuff, let's say.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:54:39):**  But especially for many people that are not in that position and where, let's say the  
**[0:54:43-0:54:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:54:43):**  nutrient density can have the biggest impact.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:54:45):**  Totally.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:54:46):**  And I very much enjoyed a podcast that you did that you published recently, when you  
**[0:54:52-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:54:52):**  were talking to that nice Italian gentleman who was doing the total cost accounting.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:54:57):**  And that there was just a stunning statistic about the value to society of creating nutrient  
**[0:55:06-0:55:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:06):**  dense food.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:07):**  That the savings to society of reducing heart disease, of reducing these diseases of civilization,  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:16):**  which you can get with nutrient density increases.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:21):**  That's from a government perspective, especially if you are subsidizing healthcare, that's  
**[0:55:27-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:27):**  a low hanging fruit.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:28):**  No, absolutely.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:29):**  But we're hopefully going to do quite a few interviews on that exact angle of nutrient  
**[0:55:35-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:35):**  density and where it matters most.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:37):**  So this is a teaser.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:39):**  Hang on there.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:40):**  It's going to come hopefully this year.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:41):**  But I want to thank you so much for your time and for a very interesting lesson.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:46):**  It's not going to be the last time I think in olive oil and decommodification, because  
**[0:55:50-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:50):**  that's the underlying storyline is something we have heard before, but not in such a large  
**[0:55:55-0:56:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:55:55):**  commodity crop or such an important crop for the Mediterranean countries, which is a massive  
**[0:56:00-0:56:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:56:00):**  region under a lot of stress, both from climate, political and all of that.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:56:04):**  But the humble olive tree can play a very important role in regenerating that.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:56:08):**  So thank you for sharing.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:56:09):**  And of course, good luck with selling as much high quality and high polyphenol grade olive  
**[0:56:16-0:56:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:56:16):**  oil as possible.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:56:17):**  Thank you, Koen.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:56:18):**  And it's been an absolute pleasure.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:56:20):**  I'm a big fan of the podcast.

**[0:57:13-0:57:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:57:13):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:57:17-0:57:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:57:17):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:57:21):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:57:23-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:57:23):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:57:27-0:57:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:57:27):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:57:32-0:57:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:57:32):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:57:37):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:57:39-0:57:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:57:39):**  How have we built our decision making framework?

**[0:58:31-0:58:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:58:31):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:58:33):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:58:37):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very

**[0:59:02-0:59:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:59:02):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:59:07-0:59:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:59:07):**  is so risky.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:59:08):**  How to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest  
**[0:59:13-0:59:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:59:13):**  in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if

**[0:59:23-0:59:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:59:23):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:59:27):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:59:32):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:59:33-0:59:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:59:33):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:59:35-0:59:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eurof-uppington#t=0:59:35):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.

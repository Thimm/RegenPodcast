### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2019-00-18)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now on to the podcast.  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:32):**  Why are we recording this series?  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the gurus on their  farms, explored farm-sized regenerative designs and most importantly started their pilots  and feedback loops.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:48):**  This is where transition finance is key.  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of flexibility  and the farmers lack of collateral.  Furthermore, there is a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give  away.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:03):**  That is why my co-host aspiring to be regenerative farmer Benedikt BÃ¶zel and I are embarking  on a journey to find out what are the key principles of transition finance for regenerative  farmers.  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative agriculture and food finance  space.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:21):**  They share their insights how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative transition  on Benedikt's 1000 hectares, which is almost 2500 acres, farm in Germany close to Berlin.  This is an open process.  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:40):**  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other inspiration, people  to interview etc.  Get in touch via the contact page on the website investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  So welcome to the podcast show, Benedikt.  I'm so excited to have you as my co-host on this journey.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:04):**  We're going to start with many interesting episodes and learn, I think, a lot on transition  finance.  So welcome.  Yeah, thank you very much.  I'm glad to be here.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:13):**  I think, you know, we have so many things to discuss and I'm really interested to see  where the journey leads us.  And can you start with giving a small introduction?  I know you, I feel pretty well, but obviously the audience doesn't.  Who you are and what made you take over a gigantic farm which we'll completely explore  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:32):**  in the next episodes in Germany.  Who's Benedikt Beusel?  That's a good question.  If I would always know that, you know, I think that would help me already quite a bit.  So basically, I was born in Munich and lived there for the first couple of years of my  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:47):**  life, but we always went to the countryside on the weekends and pretty much all I remember  is actually playing on my own, you know, in the mud, in the forest, running around, being  on my own, being free in the nature.  Having two older sisters probably is part of that equation.  You want to escape every now and then.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:09):**  Yeah, I think you kind of have to, especially in that age.  And growing up, it was quite similar.  We moved to the middle of Germany in the Rhineland where we also lived on the countryside.  So for me, you know, especially in the first couple of years, it was always about being  outside, hunting, fishing, you know, just being a boy in the open, so to say.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:32):**  So my connection to nature is really, yeah, from a very young age, I guess.  And I was always fascinated by all different animals and species and, you know, all the  complex systems and the real life you can experience when you're outside.  But you didn't, I mean, you didn't turn into a farmer immediately.  You didn't study biology or you went to farming school, but you turned into an investment  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:59):**  banking career.  That's quite a shift.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, it was actually quite the opposite.  I mean, although having grown up like that and totally focused on nature, when I was  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:10):**  in the age of, let's say, 18, 19, 20, the idea of being a farmer was not that compelling  to me.  Quite the opposite.  You know, I was looking at the whole banking industry and investment banking.  And I remember when we were like young kids starting to go out, you know, we were always  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:28):**  telling the girls, yeah, we are an investment banker and we study on the LSE in London and  so forth.  And I think, you know, I kind of bought into that because obviously having that cool banking,  a lot of money, idea and career, that was something I thought was, you know, interesting  in a way and could be a career.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:49):**  So that's really how I got into that.  And I think at that time I wasn't, let's say, I didn't reflect as much as you do when you  get older naturally.  So when I started in investment banking, we pretty much had the top phase 2006.  Then we had the financial crisis 2007.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:08):**  And that's really, you know, when I started thinking about that whole process and idea  and the kind of the value and the meaning that you can actually achieve in that industry.  And I mean, seeing how this strong system of, I don't know, that strong financial system  suddenly basically collapses into its collapses.  And to see, basically, you started at the absolute height of the wave, basically.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:37):**  And then the absolute depth came like the strongest financial crisis since the Great  Depression basically followed immediately after.  Yeah, exactly.  And I mean, as a 22 year old, you know, you view and those kind of things are obviously  quite different and seeing that immediate reaction and then seeing your cool managing  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:56):**  directors sitting in their offices and crying and you knew, okay, they have like two, three  different children.  They have huge investment in you because they have to cover and suddenly they all don't  have any jobs anymore.  That really started a certain, at least emotional process with me.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:15):**  And I mean, I think that was really the time where I kind of, you know, after two, three  years in investment banking, I started looking at, right, like, that's not your way.  I mean, you know, I was like thinking about how can I really find, you know, what I'm  supposed to do.  And having grown up in nature, having had that strong connection all my life to, let's  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:36):**  say, the natural world, I was thinking, okay, you know, this is like an area where we will  have increasingly more problems and fundamental problems.  Having seen how that crisis hit the industry and what huge effect that had on livelihoods  from people all over the world, I thought, you know, as much as this is bad, you know,  you have to turn your talents and your focus onto something that is actually good.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:02):**  So that brought me back to, you know, the question of, you know, how can you contribute?  How can you bring your talent to an area where it really matters?  And naturally, let's say, nature and resources and those processes were my strongest focus,  I guess.  And that led you to start focusing more on environmental technologies and agtech.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:27):**  How did that happen?  How did you roll into that?  What were exciting moments you remember?  I mean, still you're involved in agtech, but very soil focused.  But let's say before you took over the farm, what was your focus?  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:37):**  Well, I mean, basically, partly through my history, right?  So I had all that, let's say, financial knowledge and experience from the university, then working  in mergers and acquisitions with a bank.  After that, having done some restructuring, I knew that, you know, that is a kind of skill  set and an instrument that could be quite beneficial.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:58):**  And I didn't want to move, you know, too far away from that.  So I was looking for some situation where I can bring that in, but also, you know, move  towards things where my passion lies.  So that being, let's say, resources and land use.  And so I was between those two, having the financial side on one hand, and, you know,  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:18):**  that new kind of way and vision of getting active in the natural world, so to say.  And then I was, you know, screening basically on a worldwide scale, you know, how can you  combine the two?  What can you derive from that?  How can you develop that somehow?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:34):**  And obviously, I looked towards the US, and that was a time where you had like the first  couple of startups in the ag space, and you had VCs like Kultivia and Antera was already  doing their first fund.  Avrio was there also.  But there was no ag fund.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:55):**  There was like the structure, the ag tech structure, as we know today, wasn't yet at  all actually developed.  But seeing that idea of innovation, technological, digital innovation in the agriculture space,  I immediately thought, okay, wow, I mean, this is it.  This is exactly what we need.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:13):**  We can only solve those huge problems through innovation and obviously technology and digitalization,  obviously, bring a huge potential to that.  So after I kind of, I guess, I mean, found that or understood that, well, like, understood  that incredible potential, I wrote, let's say, a pitch, so to say, and started connecting  and contacting and meeting all the large German agriculture companies, potential investors.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:43):**  I looked for startups in the space.  I reached out to universities.  I started talking to different politicians and basically went around saying, guys, look,  there is something happening here.  There's innovation being developed.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:57):**  There's incredible potential and we need to be part of that.  And I mean, going to a very traditional, often also family run company focused on agriculture  equipment and telling them about venture capital and investing into ag tech innovation.  I mean, you know, I think those guys, they were always checking underneath the table  if I'm wearing shoes from made of wood or something because that was just not on the  
**[0:10:31-0:10:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:31):**  cards.  They never heard of it.  They never thought about that.  Like, even the pronunciation of startup is something that they took like three appointments  to get going.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:45):**  So basically, I think that was like the first time that we tried to develop those kinds  of ideas.  But you could immediately see that if you come as a 25, 26 year old, you want to raise  a fund, invest in ag tech startups after the biotech bubble, having no track record.  I mean, that's just not a very good selling point, right?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:05):**  I mean, I wouldn't give anyone money who would be in that position.  So during that phase, I met someone who just raised or started a venture capital, corporate  venture capital fund with Billfinger.  And Billfinger is also quite a traditional company in different manufacturing and engineering  processes.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:24):**  And because of their capability in water and garbage and renewable energy technologies,  they were already quite close to ag tech, let's say.  So I started working with them looking at the market in a, I guess, in a similar way.  But then they had some serious problems with regards to revenue forecasts.  And the share price fell from 84 to 40 something, which I think was the first in German history  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:52):**  to go down that badly.  So obviously, in those kind of situations, venture capital is one of the things that  I think.  The last thing.  Exactly.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:01):**  I mean, having to lay off 4,000 people and then telling someone that you'll invest into  a startup, I think it's also a difficult one.  But that was a time for me that obviously, I was very involved in the whole market of  agriculture startups in Germany.  I spoke to many of the associations that have some connection to farming.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:24):**  I did various talks and speeches at political institutes and political, like for the government.  And what I realized that all of those technologies, all of the problems, all of the, let's say,  underlying fundamentals, all of that, let's say, complexity was just overwhelming.  So I really had that strong feeling that in order to develop the market, to develop that  idea, to produce technologies, to help startups also find solutions, you need people who are  
**[0:13:01-0:13:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:01):**  on the ground.  And you need people who are on the ground and at the same time, open and willing and  able to speak to all different interest groups.  I mean, you've got to be able to talk to an ecological farmer and a conventional farmer.  You've got to be able to talk to people who are from the conservation side.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:19):**  You've got to talk to large corporates, like Bayer, for example.  You've got to be able to talk to, or not only able, but willing to politicians because we  can't solve those kind of problems on our own.  No one can.  It always has to be a sort of interdisciplinary, multifunctional group of actors and different  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:38):**  actors coming together and saying, okay, let's do this.  Let's solve this thing.  And this thing for you, also, if I understand and remember correctly, slowly more and more  and more, it started to click, like this thing starts with soil, like it starts and ends  probably with soil.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:54):**  And was it a realization that you always had?  Or was it something that over these many talks you did, many conversations you had, many  companies and startups you looked at, and obviously many farms you visited, and you  spend, I'm imagining also time on the farm of your parents, that soil moment, was there  a soil moment?  
**[0:14:13-0:14:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:13):**  Was it a soil process?  How did that grow?  Yeah, I mean, definitely.  I mean, that's a really good question.  I guess there was two moments that kind of came together.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:23):**  There was a soil moment and there was a me, myself and I moment, I guess.  So after deciding- It's our soil moment.  I think they're pretty much the same.  But after starting, I took over the family farm in December 2016.  And obviously coming from, let's say the technology side, I was deeply interested and fascinated  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:45):**  by the whole potential of, let's say, technology and digitalization.  And I thought, innovation is key.  So basically we're situated one hour east of Berlin.  And what is very special about the place is the combination of incredibly low precipitation  and sandy soil.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:02):**  So as far as the precipitation is concerned, we have an 10-year average of around 450 millimeters,  whereas the last two years are around 200 to 300 millimeters per year.  And then the soil at the same time is very sandy.  So we have about between 1.1 and 1.5% organic matter, and that combination obviously is  incredibly challenging for growing anything really.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:32):**  So I was thinking of specifying it, but it comes down to it that even a cactus needs  some water.  So basically I came from the technology side and thought, you know, innovation is key,  technological innovation is key.  And I was in contact with a couple of large agriculture equipment manufacturers saying,  
**[0:15:57-0:16:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:57):**  let's have an example of a farm, an ecological farm, 1,000 hectares, where we completely  bring in all the technology that we have, all the digital processes.  And it's one hour east of Berlin.  We can have this place where people come together, potential buyers, customers will do events  and just show what we actually can do already through technology.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:20):**  And through that process, I was sitting in my office looking outside and thinking, wow,  it's not raining.  And it continues to not rain.  And I'm thinking, I'm reading about satellite and drones and this and here and forth.  And I was like, wow, it's, I mean, like the reality of what I'll see when I look out of  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:43):**  the window versus the theory of technology and instruments that I have on this contract  lying before me, it just has nothing to do with each other.  The one thing outside, you know, the thing that I'm considering in the office, there  is a huge discrepancy between the two when it comes to actual, let's say, applicability.  practicality, yeah, I mean, exactly.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:09):**  So I stopped all of that and said, okay, this can't be the solution.  And I thought, okay, so what is the by far most important asset?  And what is like the thing I have to put all my focus on?  And then that's exactly where the soil moment really started.  Because I was like, okay, I mean, this is the key.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:30):**  I mean, soil for us, build soil organic matter, grow healthy soil, build soil fertility.  And that being said, I mean, it's the soil biology, physics, chemistry, I mean, so many  things coming together.  If I managed to build that, then that is the key for for any challenge that that there  might come.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:49):**  And I mean, there's gonna come very many, right.  And then all kinds of technologies and all kinds of ag tech, etc. will be extremely useful  if focused on building soil.  Exactly.  I mean, your soil moment.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:03):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I think, you know, I don't want to sound like I don't think technology or digitalization  is is not going to help us.  I think the potential is incredible.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:14):**  But it has to start from the soil.  And what I see today in many, many, many cases, especially in agriculture is that all the  technology, all the digital products that we have, they always try to fight a certain  problem, you know.  But I think what we do in order to restore soil in order to, you know, find agricultural  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:37):**  land use models that actually grow the soil and enhance biodiversity is not fight the  outcomes or fight the problems, but maybe take a step back and think about the root  causes of the problems and how we can actually change the root causes of the problems using  nature like in line with nature.  And I think that was then, so to say, my moment, first realizing that, you know, the focus  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:06):**  has to be soil and then realizing that, you know, there's very different methods of doing  agriculture of thinking agriculture of understanding agriculture and that, you know, being inspired  by, you know, all the legends, obviously, that we all know and the books that we all  read, you know, starting from Elin Savery, Gabe Brown, Joe Zalatin, Ernst Goetsch from  Brazil, Elaine Ingham, understanding what these guys, you know, have been doing for  
**[0:19:34-0:19:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:34):**  20, 30 years, which amazing ways of working with nature can help us in such a, yeah, I  mean, practical way, yeah, practical, amazing way.  And not taking away from, I think, the potential of technology and the potential of machinery  and the potential of software and etc.  But the goals of the system have to be right in this case, does it help farmers build soil  
**[0:20:01-0:20:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:01):**  at scale?  Or does it enable farmers to do it faster?  Or does it enable someone like you to actually make other choices and other choices that  you otherwise wouldn't have made?  Is technology actually enabling you to do more?  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:13):**  Exactly.  And I think today, as of now, we all like, there's on the one side, you know, there's  people who are pushing, obviously, the developments of technology and let's say, in a way that,  you know, we see agriculture being done on a huge scale at the moment.  And then on the other side, if there is sites, but then there's this area, this other group  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:39):**  that is, you know, focused on, let's say, nature based solutions, multifunctional land  use models, regenerative farming methods.  And I think the combination of the two, which is already here and there on a small level,  it may be already happening.  But I think once we bring those two groups together, or those two lines of thought, I  
**[0:21:01-0:21:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:01):**  think this is when agriculture will be just fascinating and like incredibly, let's say,  helping that.  Rewarding.  Rewarding not only for the farmer, but also on a, let's say, on a wider scale.  Because if you ask me, you know, farming, in my belief, is by far the biggest instrument  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:22):**  that we have for many of the big problems that we see today.  And I mean, we are talking about obviously CO2 sequestration, but we're also talking  about health.  I mean, that is one of the main parts.  Food is medicine.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:35):**  We're talking about inequality.  We're talking about rural development.  We're talking about education.  I mean, and this is, I think, all in like, not, how do you say it, like, this is all  so strongly connected to the question of how we treat nature, how we use nature in a way  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:54):**  that we can actually enhance it and make it better.  And having that regenerative idea of land use, I think, yeah, it's something that we've  already seen picking up so much in just the last couple of years.  But I think it's going to be the main thing that we'll be talking about, and not only  in the agriculture space, but I think it will actually leapfrog into other industries, which  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:16):**  we can already see.  And I think that is incredible because, you know, that kind of concept coming out of agriculture  into other industries is, yeah, it's the way it should be, I guess.  Yeah, and I think it will be fascinating in this series because this is not the last time  we'll be discussing.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:33):**  We're definitely going to focus on transition finance and obviously on the farm you took  over and we're going to discuss that a bit later.  But it touches upon so many other things.  It touches on ecosystem services, on land ownership, on health care, on CO2, on water.  I mean, they're, and we're not going to shy away from that.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:51):**  So I'm very excited to really dive deep into this case and to really see where we can get  with these models.  Thank you for listening to this episode, which is part of the Transition Finance series,  trying to find appropriate transition finance to speed up regenerative agriculture on farms.

**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:37):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:56):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision-making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:13):**  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:21):**  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:33):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:53):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:08):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:22):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:46):**  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:02):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:17):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on  the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

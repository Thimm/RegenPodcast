**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:00:14):**  How do we scale regenerative organic grain production in Brazil to the point where it's  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:00:18):**  cheaper than conventional extractive ag?  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:00:21):**  And why does it seem we've reached the tipping point both on the markets, the investors and,  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:00:26):**  very importantly, the farmers?  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:00:30):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture â€“ Investing as if  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:00:34):**  the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:00:38):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:43-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:00:43):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:00:50):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:00:52):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:00:56):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:00:59):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers, start paying much  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:01:03):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:01:08):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:32-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:01:32):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:01:34):**  Welcome to another episode today with Fabio Sakamoto, co-founder of Arizoma Agro, whose  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:01:38):**  mission is to accelerate the transition to regenerative organic agriculture by creating  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:01:42):**  the world's most efficient supply network.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:01:45):**  Welcome Fabio.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:01:46):**  Thanks Cairn, nice to be here.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:01:48):**  To start as always with a personal question, because I'm very curious about this.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:01:52):**  What brought you to soil regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:01:55):**  What was your journey to Brazil in this case and the region egg movement?  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:01:59):**  Well I am Brazilian, Japanese Brazilian.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:02):**  But you didn't live there.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:04):**  I've lived here all my life with brief stints abroad, but regenerative agriculture is the  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:11):**  biggest solution I found for the climate crisis.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:14):**  So it was by design.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:16):**  Six years ago, I took a sabbatical to study ecology and systems thinking.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:22):**  And I was looking for a way to engage with this huge problem.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:25):**  I think the problem of our generation.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:27):**  I previously had a successful career in management consulting and private equity, but I was looking  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:33):**  for a transition.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:34):**  I had already done public policy work and development work in Africa, but I found that  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:39):**  I preferred business.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:40):**  So I was looking for a project and that's when I met my business partner Pedro Diniz,  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:46):**  with whom I eventually founded Resoma Agro.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:49):**  And were you already interested in ag and soil at that time?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:53):**  Or was it really meeting Pedro that got you on the journey of looking at soil and looking  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:02:59):**  at soil way differently?  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:00):**  You probably, you maybe has ever looked at, was it already in the master of ecology that  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:03):**  you did?  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:04):**  Was there pieces on agriculture?  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:05):**  Where did the soil part start?  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:07):**  Yeah, I think that there were books and there were the Gabe Browns and the Ben Barbers and  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:11):**  the David Montgomery's, you know, and all those books, which really inspired.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:15):**  And then I think when I took the sabbatical, I went to the UK and had one year to really  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:18):**  look at ecology and deep ecology and, you know, Arnie Ness and all these guys and connected  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:25):**  more on a personal level, not just like intellectual, this is a problem, but really decided to make  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:31):**  a shift in my life.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:32):**  And so when I came back and Brazil being a big agricultural producer, this is what I  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:38):**  decided I wanted to focus on.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:40):**  And it was natural for me to meet Pedro because Pedro had a very successful organic company,  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:46):**  which he started 12 years ago.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:48):**  It was a place where everyone in Brazil who's kind of looking for this sort of transition  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:52):**  passes by either doing courses or working at the farm.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:56):**  And I met Pedro kind of more in a social context.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:03:58):**  And then I started making all these questions, which for me were very obvious because I was  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:04):**  as an investor, I was used to making all these questions.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:06):**  And after all, he said, you know, these are very good questions and I don't have the answers.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:10):**  Do you want to come and help me figure them out?  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:12):**  And I'm like, well, but you've doing this for like 10 years.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:15):**  How do you not know this?  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:16):**  We're like, no, we've been we've done a lot of experiments, but I think we could really  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:20):**  use somebody with kind of a structured mindset to come and help us look at it.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:25):**  So that's how the journey started.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:27):**  What was an example, like an example of one of those questions?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:30):**  What did you ask?  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:31):**  All these, you know, financial questions about the payback and investment and how does it  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:35):**  compare to conventional and how do you finance it?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:39):**  And then how do you scale it?  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:40):**  Because a lot of it was very artisanal systems, a lot of research being done at the farm.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:46):**  And of course, people that love farming and love the land or love research, they do the  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:50):**  research per se.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:51):**  But often there's this view, this plan missing.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:54):**  All right, once I get the answer, what is this answer for?  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:57):**  Where do I take it from there?  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:04:59):**  And this is where I kind of, yeah, this is my contribution to the project.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:02):**  And the farm, can you describe it very briefly?  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:05):**  Because we've discussed it actually in a previous interview with Paola and Walter, but just  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:09):**  to give a bit of background, like when you found Pedro and basically led to starting  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:13):**  the Zoma, what did you find or what did you visit?  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:16):**  Because you said it's a hub for people that passes through in region egg in Brazil.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:19):**  Yeah, but then I'll talk as a 2400 acre hectare farm in the state of Sao Paulo that belongs  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:26):**  to Pedro's family since three generations already.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:29):**  And it became this hub for experimentation because when Pedro decided to move to the  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:34):**  farm with his family, with his kids and really changed his life, he looked at how, what everyone  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:39):**  here I think realized, he looked at how agriculture was being done and he said, this doesn't make  
**[0:05:44-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:44):**  any sense.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:45):**  But at the same time, there was a lack of innovation.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:48):**  There was this kind of agriculture by substitution, but not anything really new.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:54):**  So he had to get a team together and start researching, you know, if you know Paul Hawkins  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:05:58):**  book, Drop Project Drawdown, and you open the page on multi-stranded agroforestry, that's  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:03):**  our farm right there.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:04):**  It's the kind of innovation that we have to do.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:06):**  So how do I, that's the photo, right?  
**[0:06:08-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:10):**  So how do we combine citrus production with agroforestry in a really efficient way?  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:14):**  Cause it's not just putting things together, just adding trees to a citrus grove, organic  
**[0:06:19-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:19):**  citrus doesn't make it automatically profitable.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:22):**  It's much more complex than that, you know, the designs and how you set it up.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:27):**  So there was a lot of experimentation there in fruit production, different types of fruits,  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:34):**  grain production, and the idea was like a full circle.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:36):**  So we were producing the grains for the chickens, Ferdinando Tocca is Brazil's biggest organic  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:43):**  eggs producer.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:44):**  And then the chickens generate the manure, which go out and fertilize the fields.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:49):**  And you have this nice little mixture, there was a dairy operation because you also had  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:53):**  the grazing component and the rotation.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:56):**  So it was really, really interesting.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:06:58):**  So it was a decade of experimentation, but when, as often, a lot of these projects are  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:04):**  fueled by a dream.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:05):**  And then after a while you say, okay, now let's get a little bit pragmatic because we  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:08):**  need to return some of the capital that we've put here.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:11):**  And they found a nice way to profitability with the organic eggs.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:15):**  But there was a question of what are we going to do with all this agricultural research,  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:19):**  this treasure trove that was there.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:21):**  And at the same time, I mean, we're talking about 2016, 15, 16, we really saw an inflection  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:28):**  point in some of the organic markets.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:31):**  Pedro, having been there for decades, I don't know, many of the ideas I had 10 years ago  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:35):**  were not viable, but suddenly things are looking up.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:37):**  So because basically demand was growing at the time, it's still growing actually, but  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:42):**  it was growing double digit for many, many, many markets.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:45):**  And there was, or there is in many cases, a shortage of ingredients and the shortage  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:49):**  of organic certified real stuff.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:52):**  And in the past, I mean, every organic farmer were related to this, we produce products  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:55):**  that we couldn't sell, like who was going to buy them.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:07:58):**  And you're dealing with agricultural products, it's fresh, you can't store it very long.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:03):**  And the supply chain just wasn't there, the value chain.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:06):**  And things started to change.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:08):**  And that's when we decided to say, hey, okay, how can we, we created a nice project.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:13):**  There was a lot of research here.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:14):**  How can we really use this knowledge to influence and change the system?  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:19):**  So that's when we, and I've been a management consultant before I worked with Bain and company  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:24):**  for many years, for seven years.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:26):**  So we did like a project just as I would have done for any of my Bain clients.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:30):**  So let's do a strategic plan, like seven months long, travel all over the world, visit farms  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:36):**  in Brazil and abroad, visit clients, talk about prices, talk about quality issues, get  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:41):**  workshops and bring in the agronomists, the conventional and the organic, and let's figure  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:45):**  out a way how to produce this and where the opportunities are.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:49):**  So we are now focusing on scaling organic grains and pulses and also the fruit production.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:55):**  We also study coffee, cacao.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:08:57):**  I mean, there's huge opportunities everywhere, but you've got to focus on something.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:00):**  And this is where we are now.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:02):**  And so what is, we're now June, 2020, what is the Rizoma agro at the moment?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:08):**  It's the, because you're focusing on grain, you said on pulses and citrus, you're doing  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:13):**  it yourself.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:14):**  You're partnering with farmers.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:15):**  What's the model that you came up with in our building at the moment?  
**[0:09:17-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:18):**  So when we created the company, we decided we released 1,200 hectares for R&D.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:24):**  This is Brazilian sized R&D.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:27):**  I know some people in Italy and the Netherlands will get a heart attack now.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:30):**  That's a small size farm.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:32):**  But it's also an attempt to accelerate the process of getting lots of experiments within  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:36):**  one cropping season.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:38):**  So that we can really advance.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:39):**  I think this was the key metric during the first three years.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:42):**  How much are we learning?  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:43):**  How close are we to conventional yields and cost of production?  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:47):**  So we released this 1,200 hectares and we started producing and we got better at producing.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:53):**  We got hammered in the first year.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:54):**  It got better in the second year.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:56):**  It's great now in the third year.  
**[0:09:58-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:58):**  We closed the productivity gap.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:09:59):**  We're producing the same amount of organic soil as our neighbors.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:02):**  And we also did all the commercial development.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:05):**  Which means non-organic soil, just the conventional extractive soil.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:09):**  You're reaching the same.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:10):**  Did you have any tough years?  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:11):**  Because what I've heard, and obviously I'm not a farmer, that especially in tough years  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:15):**  of drought, et cetera, the regenerative ones seem to hold up much better than the conventional  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:20):**  ones.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:21):**  Have you had experience yet there?  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:22):**  Or it's been okay years so far?  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:25):**  The years were, we had a tough year and it was also tough for the conventional neighbors.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:28):**  But I think because we're doing all these things at the same time and there was so much  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:33):**  to improve in technology, I didn't even experience this effect.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:37):**  For me, the biggest effects were getting the basics right, like timing of operations and  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:42):**  seeds and what you do, when you do it, how you do it, getting the team better.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:46):**  But also technology.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:47):**  So bringing in scouting apps so that we can identify pests before they become a problem.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:52):**  A lot of biological research.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:56):**  This is machinery, of course.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:10:58):**  So RTK, precision machinery, camera-guided cultivators, all these different things.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:02):**  They made a huge difference.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:04):**  And this is how we were able to close this gap.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:06):**  And the cost part?  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:07):**  Because you mentioned both.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:09):**  And the cost part, we are today, as of today, we're, depending on the crop, still 20 to  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:13):**  30% more expensive on a per hectare basis.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:17):**  But we have a plan to reduce this, for example, in soy to 18 within the next two years with  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:21):**  more use of biologicals.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:23):**  And I think eventually we will get this to the same price of conventional.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:26):**  But the good news is, I think, from what we see in consumer research, when you get within  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:31):**  this range, that's when consumers change their behavior.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:33):**  Yeah, because 18% is not shocking.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:37):**  And you have the big advantage that you're getting better.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:40):**  You're on such a steep learning curve where the conventional guys and girls have been  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:43):**  on and are actually declining in many cases because they're extractive.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:47):**  And you're in unknown territory in many cases and are just...  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:51):**  And my soil is getting better.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:52):**  I mean, your lees land, so it's not yours.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:53):**  But yeah, this soil is getting better.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:54):**  Yeah, it doesn't lees land, but it's a 14-year lease.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:11:59):**  So we'll have it for a long time.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:01):**  But it would happen, as you see in the Roald Dahl System trial, the soil is really getting  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:05):**  better.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:06):**  And when my neighbors have tough years, probably we might have an average over a long time  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:11):**  because we will perform better.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:12):**  And then, okay, so you're leasing that big but still small piece of land.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:16):**  You're getting to the third year now and actually showing very interesting results in terms  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:20):**  of production and yield.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:22):**  So what's next?  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:23):**  So during these three years, we also had to, of course, sell this grain and talk to the  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:28):**  multinational companies and local companies buying this and establishing.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:32):**  And we even did some exports to test it, if we can get the quality right, if there's no  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:37):**  contamination issues and it worked great.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:39):**  We exported to Europe and the US.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:42):**  And now we are...  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:43):**  We had to get the funding for this agriculture.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:45):**  It's working capital intensive.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:48):**  That's another part, but...  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:49):**  The machines aren't cheap yet.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:51):**  Machines aren't cheap.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:52):**  But we are now at the point where we are comfortable with offering this technology to other farmers.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:12:58):**  So we created this service package, which we call Regenerative Organic as a Service,  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:02):**  where we will partner with a farmer, transfer this technology, help them produce, and then  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:07):**  we sell this grain together.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:09):**  And then we collect the fee for our services.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:11):**  So it's a win-win because the farmer doesn't pay anything upfront.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:15):**  We're there to really, really help them through the transition.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:17):**  We are farmers ourselves.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:19):**  So they come and they learn at our farm.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:21):**  We go and we teach them.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:23):**  And we are now creating this production network of farmers.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:27):**  And this is, I think, something worth mentioning.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:29):**  This is...  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:30):**  Brazil is known for this super large scale farmers.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:35):**  These are farmers that have gotten so big in the last 30, 40, 50 years.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:40):**  That's when the Cerrado became agricultural land because of the evolution of technology.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:45):**  A lot of these farmers are now in the second generation and are looking for more sustainable  
**[0:13:51-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:51):**  solutions.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:52):**  Part of the interesting process was us coming from the ecological point of view.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:13:58):**  But when we did our Brazil trip and you really engage with people on a personal level, you  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:03):**  see that they want to change things and they're tired of being the bad guys.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:07):**  Farming as I think everyone knows is a tough business.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:10):**  The food system is not really fair to farmers, but that's a whole different issue.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:15):**  But you don't need an ecologist to go and tell the farmer what's happening to his or  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:19):**  her land.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:20):**  They know what's happening.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:21):**  They can see it.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:22):**  They know it better than anyone else.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:24):**  And they are looking for solutions.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:26):**  But the fact is we have a system where all the research and development in agronomy,  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:33):**  all the technical assistance is being given by the chemical companies, the input companies.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:38):**  For free, for free.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:39):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:40):**  And also the financing, right?  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:41):**  Because you're bartering the product versus the production.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:45):**  And so how do farmers convert?  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:48):**  Who is there to help them?  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:49):**  There's a big transformation going on in this industry.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:52):**  Who's going to be there to help the farmers?  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:53):**  Because it's very tough for the farmer to bet the farm on an idea and lose everything  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:14:58):**  that they worked so hard to build.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:01):**  So there's a big gap there.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:02):**  And this is what we're trying to fill today.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:04):**  Because if you're going to convert, technical assistance is hard to come by.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:08):**  And I think this is for impossible depending on where you are.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:12):**  And I think this is where organic could be better with much more science, better qualified  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:15):**  technicians.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:16):**  The offtake is not easy.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:18):**  I mean, it's contracts.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:19):**  Usually with companies, it's not kind of a commodity.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:22):**  Let me just drive my grain to the grain elevator and collect the money.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:26):**  There's certifications and traceability and there's specific logistic.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:29):**  It's very tough to convert.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:31):**  And I understand the resistance and the financing part.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:34):**  Oh, of course.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:35):**  I mean, we were discussing this in the pre-interview.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:37):**  It's almost a miracle that many have made the transition against or the transition are  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:41):**  on the transition pathway and against all odds.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:44):**  And I think but it's interesting to hear that you've seen not just which is something we  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:48):**  see every day in the supermarket and the market, the growth of the consumer side of things  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:53):**  for organic because it's easy to recognize, but hopefully also for regenerative organic  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:57):**  in the future.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:15:58):**  But that there's actually a generation of farmers that is at least willing to listen  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:03):**  and is willing to do some experiments, not betting the farm, which I don't think we should  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:06):**  expect from anybody, but to engage and see.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:09):**  We had similar it's very interesting how you mentioned the pieces, the essential pieces  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:13):**  of transitioning, which is very similar.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:16):**  And I will link it below in a discussion we had with the Perennial Fund and agriculture  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:20):**  like access to independent advice and peers like expert advice, experts that are not paid  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:25):**  by input companies of take both for and it depends a bit where you are, obviously, but  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:30):**  for your produce during the transition and after the transition and for potentially your  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:34):**  ecosystem services, depending if there's a market marketplaces which are popping up left  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:38):**  and right and then flexible finance.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:40):**  But it's the third like if you don't have the other two, forget about it because you  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:44):**  need the hands to help you to actually do this that have done it before and can show  
**[0:16:48-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:48):**  you and so you can touch it.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:50):**  You can know which machines to buy, which not.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:53):**  And you need the offtake.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:54):**  You need the markets to be ready to support you in that process.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:16:56):**  And this is how we manage to align this because we are farmers, we are farming, and I'm not  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:00):**  interested in selling any inputs or even advice.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:02):**  I think if you go to organic conferences, sometimes in the US, it seems like soil is  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:08):**  very complicated.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:09):**  You need to know, you know, because people are selling advice.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:13):**  You have to if you have too much magnesium, it's going to lock up the calcium and people  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:17):**  sometimes make it sound very complex and we're experimenting it ourselves and we're saying  
**[0:17:21-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:21):**  this worked for us.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:22):**  This didn't work for us.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:23):**  Here's the science.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:24):**  We also have a very strong team.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:26):**  This is what works in this place, this context with this soil when we got it.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:31):**  You can relate to it or you can't.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:33):**  That's pretty much the yeah.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:34):**  And combining I think there's a huge wealth in combining this is what we do in our team  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:39):**  combining professionals with decades experience of organic with professionals with decades  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:43):**  of experience with conventional.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:45):**  So one guy has very good inspiration and observes nature.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:49):**  The other guy is good at operations, at standardizing things, and also bringing a lot of science  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:54):**  and research and isolating factors and put these two guys together in a room and really  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:17:59):**  interesting things come out.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:00):**  But you have to find this bridge for these two worlds to collaborate and the language  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:04):**  yet because otherwise they would come out of the room with a lot of shared knowledge.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:08):**  They will come out of the room really annoyed by the other.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:11):**  And so you're creating basically this hub and spokes model or you're basically the regenerative  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:17):**  organic approach in a box or as an approach to others with as a long term or medium term  
**[0:18:23-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:23):**  goal.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:24):**  What's the medium term goal doing that?  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:25):**  Are you running a huge wholesaler?  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:27):**  You're going to sell off inputs?  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:28):**  Probably not if I guess you're are you what are you interested in as a long term?  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:33):**  No, no, no, no, no.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:35):**  We are interested in furthering our technical development.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:37):**  So we have 12 years of research and we want to continue that.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:40):**  And as you saw, to keep increasing productivity and lowering costs and making regenerative  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:46):**  organic more competitive.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:49):**  So we're going to keep doing research to stay ahead of the curve.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:51):**  On the grain and pulses side mostly and the citrus, is that very different or similar?  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:56):**  All of the citrus, none of the same, the same.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:18:58):**  It's just that citrus is more capital intensive.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:00):**  So we have 50 hectares of citrus experiments.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:03):**  The grain moved very fast.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:04):**  So within three years with different experiments, we were able to advance very quickly.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:09):**  Citrus now we're having great results, but it's perennials.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:11):**  You have to wait until the fourth year when you're getting full production.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:15):**  It's looking really good.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:16):**  The citrus grove has very low disease rate because of all the biodiversity that is in  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:21):**  there.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:22):**  The productivity is looking really, really good.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:23):**  We actually advanced one year of productivity.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:26):**  We even had production this year that wasn't expected.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:29):**  But let's see next year and then let's compare that with the curve.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:32):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:33):**  And let's see in the next few years.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:35):**  And are you mixing them at some point?  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:37):**  Like is it the agroforestry idea obviously of the farm you're coming from?  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:41):**  You were born in as a project, as a company.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:43):**  Is there, are we going to see trees in the grain operation as well?  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:46):**  We love this idea.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:48):**  We're not mixing this right now.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:50):**  Just getting large scale organic grain farmers to consider what we're doing, doing everything  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:55):**  biologically and organically is quite a big step.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:19:59):**  And we don't want to freak them out.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:02):**  Plants and animals might be a bit out there.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:03):**  Yeah, I can imagine.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:04):**  If you know what, if I had land and I'm worried about the resilience of my system for the  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:10):**  decade to come, I would plant trees.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:13):**  Not every five meters, of course, but it's proven that trees reduce your evapotranspiration  
**[0:20:17-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:17):**  and it helps you keep the water there.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:19):**  And I would plant trees and maybe take the hit on the yield right next to the trees because  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:24):**  you have some shading, but I think there'll be other benefits.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:26):**  I would do it.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:27):**  And something we want to do experimentally too.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:29):**  Would you integrate animals as well?  
**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:31):**  We do integrate animals at our farm.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:33):**  We have, besides the citrus and the grains, we have several pastoral systems that we're  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:37):**  piloting.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:38):**  We did a 44 hectare pilot where 11 hectares of each system is being tested.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:44):**  Three systems are being tested versus a witness system, which is just a rotational grazing.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:49):**  And we are measuring everything.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:50):**  We have university researchers come and measure the soil and the yields and the costs and  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:20:56):**  the reduction of inputs so that we can quantify this.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:00):**  Step by step.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:01):**  Wow.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:02):**  Actually the 12 years plus the three years, we're a lot of R&D.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:06):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:07):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:08):**  And to your question, I think you just look at the, for example, organic grains and pulses.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:13):**  Organic grains today are less than 1% of total conventional grains.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:18):**  Like 0.63.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:20):**  And we can question what's going to happen with all these grains because a lot of these  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:23):**  grains is for feed, but 0.63% is just not enough.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:27):**  And if people want plant-based burgers, you need the soy.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:31):**  It's being done with GMO soy right now.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:34):**  It doesn't make any sense.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:35):**  So there's a huge opportunity there.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:37):**  To some players it makes sense.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:38):**  They were very convinced about the choosing GMO soy because it has a lower environmental  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:43):**  impact.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:44):**  And I know some people in the audience got very, very annoyed by that.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:46):**  I will leave it at that.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:48):**  And maybe pragmatically, like how are you going to source all this organic soy?  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:52):**  I mean, you already have a deficit of soy, but that's where players like us and other  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:57):**  farmers come in.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:21:58):**  I mean, if they think long term, I mean, if you're in for the carbon, for the climate,  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:02):**  you cannot make those decisions.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:04):**  Even if your life cycle assessment company we're talking about, I think it was impossible,  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:09):**  showed clearly that, I mean, the same life cycle assessment company, QANTES, showed a  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:13):**  clear benefit of regenerative agriculture on Will Harris's farm and a net soil, like  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:18):**  a net carbon sink.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:21):**  And they kept arguing that the best thing was to do to get GMO soy.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:24):**  I always wonder when is the last time they visited a regenerative farm and a real size  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:29):**  large scale?  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:30):**  And how do you come to those conclusions?  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:32):**  I always wonder what happened there.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:34):**  But anyway, so there's going to be a huge market for regenerative organic.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:38):**  So as it is, the organic market is already growing and there's not nearly enough at the  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:42):**  moment.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:44):**  So we, I mean, just looking at the market as it is, we see a potential for creating  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:48):**  a network of about 350,000 hectares within the next years of production.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:53):**  This is, I think, look at the global market.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:55):**  All around where you're now, basically all around your hub.  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:22:59):**  And three times across Brazil, which we've mapped.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:01):**  It sounds like a lot to a foreigner, but it's less than 1% of the soy area in Brazil.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:06):**  I know farmers who plant 170,000 hectares, 200,000 hectares of individual families.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:13):**  So getting to 350 within the next couple of years shouldn't be too hard.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:17):**  There's definitely the demand there.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:18):**  And this is what we want to create, create this network.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:20):**  So what's going to be the hardest piece there to get there?  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:23):**  I mean, if the land is there, the farmers are interested, you mentioned you've, I wouldn't  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:27):**  say figured out the recipe, but are getting close to getting comfortable with the recipe.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:31):**  What's the biggest barrier or the hardest part for you now to get that done over the  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:35):**  next couple of years?  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:36):**  It's actually been moving very quickly.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:38):**  We thought it was going to be more difficult.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:40):**  We thought we were going to do a more asset heavy model where we would have to raise capital,  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:44):**  invest ourselves first.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:46):**  Farmers are like this, they need to see it before they believe it because everyone's  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:49):**  trying to sell a farm or something.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:50):**  Of course.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:51):**  But when they come to our farm and they see what we've done, we already working with  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:55):**  farmers.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:57):**  I will link some videos below.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:23:58):**  There's a video of a field day, which is quite interesting.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:01):**  And you see the reaction of farmers visiting your operation.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:03):**  So this was the first time we kind of engaged with farmers.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:06):**  This was five months ago, right before COVID and they come to the farm and the video is  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:10):**  nice to see because they are shocked.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:13):**  They are expecting like this.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:15):**  You can see the shock.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:17):**  It's very, yeah.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:18):**  It's like low tech, you know, field full of weeds and really bad production.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:23):**  I think there's one guy, there are two guys saying, one is, yeah, I've been in organic  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:26):**  for a long time, but I've never seen it at this scale.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:29):**  And then the other, immediately after someone says something exactly, yeah, I, to see crops  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:33):**  this clean and this neat and this full or something, he says is very inspiring.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:38):**  He said something like that.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:40):**  We had farming groups there that represented 110,000 hectares, I think, or 120 and 70%  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:46):**  of them wanted to engage and enter into discussions of partnership.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:50):**  So right now we're starting to roll this out.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:53):**  I think for these farmers, for them financing a thousand hectares of organic, it's not an  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:58):**  issue for them.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:24:59):**  They have access to capital.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:00):**  I think if you really want to scale this, and I would love to scale this not only on  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:04):**  agricultural area and replace conventional, but also on degraded pasture lands.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:10):**  Because as you know, we have all these degraded pastures, which are not doing us any service  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:14):**  in terms of carbon and not even economically, they're good for anything.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:18):**  They're actually losing carbon.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:20):**  They're losing carbon.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:21):**  We could, Brazil as a country could triple, Brazil is already number one in soy, but we  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:24):**  could triple grain production in Brazil without clearing a single hectare from the forest.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:30):**  If we just plant on this land that is already available, we know the world needs more supply.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:34):**  And with this, we will be taking pressure off the forest, you know, let the police take  
**[0:25:39-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:39):**  care of the bandits that are cutting down the farms.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:41):**  It's not being cut for economic reasons.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:43):**  There's plenty of land.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:44):**  And I think to convert this land, an issue might be access to funding because then of  
**[0:25:49-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:49):**  course it's more capital intensive than what the farmers are doing now.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:52):**  Because right now they're converting their own land, but there's a huge, huge opportunity  
**[0:25:56-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:56):**  here.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:25:57):**  And their trees might be part of the picture at some point.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:01):**  Silver pasture systems.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:02):**  And this thesis was kind of custom made for this very specific Brazilian reality.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:06):**  Like we thought a lot, like over three years, we was like, how do we engage the farmers?  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:11):**  And now, so we created a model, the farmer doesn't pay us anything upfront.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:14):**  Of course this creates capital requirements on my side and I need to raise capital to  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:18):**  give them technical assistance, but it really creates a transparent win-win value proposition  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:23):**  that, Hey, if you're not making money, I'm not going to make money and we're going to  
**[0:26:26-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:26):**  do this together.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:27):**  So the fee is connected to the farmer.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:30):**  How does the fee work and how does the offtake work?  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:33):**  Because you said we sell the grain together.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:34):**  So how does the fee and the offtake work?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:37):**  Let's say I'm a farmer.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:38):**  Well, we take care, you give the grain to us and then we find the buyer.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:43):**  We give you something that doesn't exist in the farmer.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:45):**  We give you full transparency on the costs that we got with the buyer.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:49):**  Which no wholesaler on the planet does.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:53):**  Except for, I interviewed A. Ostra in the Netherlands and Falkert, the founder, always  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:26:56):**  said, I mean, he has a number of amazing lines, but they're one of the few that in fruit and  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:00):**  vegetables, they give full transparency to their farmers and none of them ever left or  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:03):**  ever transferred back to non-organic.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:06):**  And he says, it's normal, but we're not trying to, we're trying to play the long game.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:09):**  We're not trying to play you, but most of the others obviously are buying wherever and  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:13):**  keeping everybody in the dark because that's how trading in many cases work.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:17):**  Unfortunately.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:19):**  So we get like a, depending on the crop, 6% fee, which is for part of this fees for our  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:24):**  technical assistance, all the help we provided in part of it is for this commercial service  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:27):**  and developing the commercial side.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:31):**  And it's been interesting.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:32):**  The farmer is like, wow, you're really going to come with a contract.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:36):**  Which makes you want to sell it for a good premium.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:40):**  Interesting.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:41):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:42):**  And so you're trying to find the interesting markets that are screaming for more regenerative  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:46):**  farms.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:47):**  Obviously.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:48):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:49):**  So that's how I engage with you.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:50):**  And basically that's what you're rolling out now.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:52):**  And as we speak, COVID, post-COVID, I mean, you're not in post-COVID yet, but as the world  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:27:57):**  slowly start opening up, I mean, farms have always been running, obviously nobody stopped  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:01):**  there.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:02):**  Many markets have continued to run.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:05):**  So where are you now?  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:06):**  We're talking the end of June.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:08):**  What's the phase you're in at the moment?  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:10):**  We are going to, so from this field day in February, we are onboarding three new farmers  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:15):**  for the season that starts now in October.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:17):**  We are expanding with the current farmer that we piloted with, and we will be now doing  
**[0:28:22-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:22):**  more events, more field days to bring more farmers on.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:25):**  So we are hiring more people to give technical assistance to these farmers.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:30):**  We need to train these people.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:31):**  We need to develop our technological platform because we want to interact with these farmers  
**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:35):**  using technology.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:37):**  So how does it work with the farmer?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:38):**  Now, farmers are in different places across Brazil.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:42):**  They come to our farm, they get training.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:43):**  We go to their farms, we train them, but we do a full planning of the season and my team  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:47):**  meets with the farmer every week.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:49):**  So every week there's a zoom call on Thursday where they go over everything that's been  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:53):**  done and everything that's going to be done in the next week.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:28:56):**  And we are working with the farmers now to get real time data with the sensors and all  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:01):**  the information so that by the time Thursday arrives, we know everything that has happened  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:05):**  and the planning is just easier and automatic so that we have all this data.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:09):**  And all this data will also help us getting more and more accumulative experience.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:14):**  But you're replacing the input guys, the singhentas, the buyers that are already doing it.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:19):**  The best friend of the farmer is the agronomist that comes on the farm.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:22):**  The only friend in many cases.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:24):**  And as long as we don't change the agronomist or the advice, then nothing will move because  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:29):**  the farmer is not going to risk, rightfully so, any season because they only have 40.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:34):**  So that's about it.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:36):**  And we're also trying to work with these guys where possible.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:38):**  I mean, these companies are super important for agriculture.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:41):**  They have seed companies, they have biological inputs.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:44):**  Now they're all investing heavily in biologicals.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:46):**  Of course, of course.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:48):**  So now everyone wants everyone's a partner and this is what we want to engage.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:51):**  I mean, individual people are friendly.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:54):**  They want to help.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:55):**  They want to transform.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:56):**  Of course, these companies, some of them are quicker.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:29:58):**  Some of them are slower, but we are having great results in interacting with the John  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:03):**  Deere's, the chemical companies, even like the bio inputs, like the corporates.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:07):**  Everyone's kind of helping us develop these farming systems.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:11):**  Everyone's interested in what we're doing.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:12):**  And what do you see as the biggest barriers, let's say more generally in REGEN-AC?  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:16):**  I mean, obviously you've done the scan and the research for specifically Brazil and specifically  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:20):**  large scale to have an impact on chemical use on a lot of hectares because that's what  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:24):**  you're going for.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:25):**  And if you would zoom out a bit, what do you see as the biggest barriers currently that  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:29):**  are holding back regenerative agriculture and food?  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:34):**  So for the people that already know how to do it, and that's a minority, but for those  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:40):**  people, I think it's long-term contracts.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:42):**  So on the offtake, offtake side.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:46):**  The offtaker gives the farmer a five-year contract.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:49):**  It's what the farmer needs to raise capital and to make sure that he or she will have  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:53):**  enough time to work the land and receive the return.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:30:57):**  So that could be something investors, I mean, that's transition finance at the end.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:00):**  That's financeable if the contract is there.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:06):**  So I think that would be key to unlocking this.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:08):**  And for, of course, the many farmers that are not there yet, it's I think the two issues  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:12):**  that we've mentioned is technical assistance and financing.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:16):**  Financing is trying, but technical assistance is not moving nearly as quickly as we need  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:20):**  it to.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:21):**  And it's too expensive for farmers just to learn by trial and error.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:24):**  And many might get discouraged if they try something and it doesn't work.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:28):**  I've tried these cover crops and it doesn't work.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:30):**  And now I let go.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:33):**  I bought a very expensive tool.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:34):**  And yeah, that's, I mean, then you lose trust and we lose a generation that won't come back  
**[0:31:39-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:39):**  very quickly.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:40):**  Yes.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:41):**  And so if we, I mean, not giving investment advice, but looking at, let's say a lot of  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:46):**  investors are listening to this podcast, hopefully, and they're all excited about soil and about  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:50):**  the why and climate, et cetera.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:53):**  Where do you think they should start?  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:55):**  What would be questions you ask?  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:31:56):**  I mean, we get bombarded with techs, with agriculture, technology companies, with et  
**[0:32:01-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:01):**  cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:02):**  What would be your advice to smart investors to look out for or to questions to ask when  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:08):**  starting to put their toes in the water in terms of investing in this space?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:12):**  Well, I need, you need to get much more than your toes in the water.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:16):**  I think there's such a depth of knowledge to understand.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:19):**  So take your time studying this, but, and then looking at thesis, I think you need to  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:23):**  look for outstanding teams with skin in the game.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:28):**  And you need to look for an investment thesis with proven unit economics.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:34):**  So what do I mean by that?  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:36):**  I mean, this is from the venture capital playbook.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:38):**  You need to know what you're going to produce and have a good idea of how much it will cost.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:43):**  You need to know who you're going to sell it to.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:45):**  What's the type of contract, how much it costs, what are the prices.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:49):**  And making sure you've done it.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:52):**  And I think this is where, you know, this is where the segment is now versus taking  
**[0:32:56-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:32:56):**  the playbook of growth equity or private equity, where you're asking farmers for 10 years of  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:03):**  track record and show me the markets of the last 10 years.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:06):**  Yeah, it's not there.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:08):**  Already generating cash.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:09):**  And this is where we are being realistic, but it works really well in private equity.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:12):**  And why do I mean by unit economics now?  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:14):**  So a lot of the farmers I see going into regenerative can be very philosophical about it.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:20):**  So I'm going to do 10 crops, but how do you sell them?  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:24):**  It's hard enough to sell one crop.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:25):**  It's a lot of work and getting the right, finding the right buyer, doing all that, this  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:30):**  intermediation and all that, that how are you going to sell 10 crops?  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:34):**  And people fall in love with the spreadsheet and fall in love with the farm, but then reality  
**[0:33:38-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:38):**  is really tough.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:39):**  So I would look for these two things.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:41):**  And I think you've been mentioning one of the podcasts, I think teams that have good  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:47):**  economical teams and experienced economical teams, but I think people with management  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:52):**  experience and governance, I think that's basic for good investors, investing in products  
**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:57):**  that have good, good practices.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:33:59):**  That's what I would look for.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:00):**  And this is where the sector is at right now.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:02):**  Maybe in a few years you can have growth investors coming in and say, Hey, if you are beyond  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:07):**  a hundred million dollars in revenues and whatnot, then I can come in.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:11):**  But the really regenerative initiatives I think are at this stage of development.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:14):**  Right?  
**[0:34:15-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:15):**  No, no, I agree.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:16):**  I think it's getting your feet more than wet and learning and having a longterm view because  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:22):**  some of this is going to take time and we're really at the early stages of figuring out  
**[0:34:26-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:26):**  a lot of these things at scale.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:27):**  I mean, a lot has been done, but figuring out a lot of these things at scale and nobody  
**[0:34:32-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:32):**  knows what the market is going to do.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:33):**  So unless you really know your costs.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:34):**  Yeah, and this is the importance of a good team because you're going to pivot it many  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:38):**  times you're going to discover new things and a good team with skin in the game that's  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:43):**  there with you.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:44):**  It takes away this distance between investor and farmers.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:47):**  You know, the investor that says, here's the five year business plan.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:49):**  I want you to stick exactly to the five.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:52):**  Doesn't understand, doesn't understand agriculture.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:54):**  It's not going to help the farmer.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:34:56):**  And it's an interesting point you made about the rotation or the 10 crops or it depends  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:00):**  a bit really if you're in a perennial system, you plant multiple, how complex it gets.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:04):**  You need to sell that, which is a potential role for people like you, obviously, like  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:08):**  slowly introducing more complexity.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:11):**  If there's a customer that's asking for crop number three or four and suddenly assist the  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:16):**  farming system or platform becomes much more complex.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:18):**  But it is because, you know, it works agronomically, but also because there's a customer actually  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:23):**  willing to buy crop number three or four and intermediaries like yourself become extremely  
**[0:35:28-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:28):**  relevant, but not for the individual farmer to plant 10 crops and then hope for the best.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:34):**  Exactly.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:35):**  And I think this is the sector is a kind of a chicken and egg thing.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:38):**  So if you are a big multinational company and you, oh, let's do a different type of  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:43):**  soy with higher protein and all of this, you need a minimum scale to develop this.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:48):**  So they come to us and say, can you deliver 10,000 hectares of this?  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:52):**  I said, I can't right now, but if you give me two years, I can, and you give me a contract.  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:57):**  So these two things have to move together.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:35:58):**  And that's the work that the farmer can do on his own and that we can help and also develop  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:04):**  different varieties and pulses, which are huge opportunity.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:08):**  Why do you say that?  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:09):**  Pulses are a bit of a hype right now, but all the protein and the vegetable proteins,  
**[0:36:13-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:13):**  I think it makes a lot of sense to grow.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:16):**  They're easier to, some of them are easier to grow and it makes a lot of sense from the  
**[0:36:20-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:20):**  nutrition point.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:22):**  And from the soil perspective and nutrition perspective as well.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:24):**  And they fit in your rotation.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:29):**  And you have experience with managing capital, but maybe not so much in the, like this amount  
**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:34):**  in the regenerative ag space.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:36):**  What if you wake up tomorrow morning?  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:37):**  I mean, I ask this question often now and you're the head of a $1 billion investment  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:41):**  portfolio or 1 billion Euro and you can choose, I would choose a Euro.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:45):**  It's a bit more at the moment, but what would you focus on?  
**[0:36:48-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:48):**  You have an unlimited timeline.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:49):**  Like it doesn't need to be, it's not a private equity fund with a 10 year horizon, but it  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:54):**  does have to come back.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:55):**  So it is an investment.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:36:56):**  How would you split up the one with the nine zeros over, which is a lot of money at the  
**[0:37:01-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:01):**  same time.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:02):**  And at the same time, nothing, if you compare it to the agriculture investments in Brazil  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:05):**  or general in the world, how would you put that to work?  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:08):**  So if I had a very open mandate, which would be a dream for any asset manager now, and  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:12):**  I would, with the knowledge I know, and we thought very deeply about this, I would invest  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:18):**  some of it in production and I would do tropical agroforest resistance.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:23):**  And I'll tell you why.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:24):**  And as I mentioned before, I think there's also a window of opportunity to combine this  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:28):**  with more short term annuals, like grains and pulses.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:32):**  And I would also invest in this space where farming is being disrupted and there are opportunities  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:39):**  to fill in the gaps.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:40):**  So let me go to the first thing.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:42):**  I think tropical agroforestry systems, they work, they work really well.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:45):**  The trees grow really fast in the tropics.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:48):**  And there are some products that you will not produce anywhere.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:51):**  A Norwegian will not produce locally sourced coffee or chocolate.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:54):**  And I think people will still want coffee or chocolate in the future, or even things  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:37:58):**  like citrus have to come from somewhere.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:01):**  But not only because of that, I think capital is scarce in the tropics.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:04):**  It's hard to come by in long term capital, even much more so.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:08):**  So there are not a lot of investments.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:12):**  And I think we will live in a world where 10 years down the road, we were like, oh,  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:15):**  I wish I had planted those trees 10 years ago.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:19):**  And who's got them now?  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:20):**  I think there's an African proverb, like the best moment to plant a tree is 15 years ago  
**[0:38:24-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:24):**  or 10 years ago, depending on how fast they grow.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:26):**  The second best moment is today.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:28):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:30):**  These systems, we've been piloting them, they work really well.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:34):**  And it's super regenerative.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:36):**  And we'll go into that afterwards, because the agroforestry systems are sequestering  
**[0:38:40-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:40):**  more than 40 tons of CO2 per hectare per year.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:42):**  It's amazing.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:44):**  And producing a lot of food.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:45):**  The myth of these systems, it's a mix and it comes back to the rotation question or  
**[0:38:50-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:50):**  like what happens if you plant a lot of different crops and animals through it, et cetera.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:54):**  You have to sell all of it.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:38:55):**  If you manage to do that, it produces an amount of calories, an amount of food, fiber and  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:00):**  oils per hectare that is unbeatable in any other system I've seen, at least.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:05):**  It's really, really, really productive.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:08):**  So from the investor, you have a portfolio of tropical agroforestry and it's going nicely  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:13):**  and it's producing, it's generating cash from the fourth, fifth year on.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:17):**  And you have that for another 15 years and you have the timber in the end, which is also  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:21):**  really nice because that timber will then pay for the renewal of the agroforestry system.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:26):**  So it becomes almost like a perennial investment.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:29):**  You just sell the timber in the end so that you can renew the production.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:31):**  And it's a one shot investment.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:33):**  I think the grains are a nice combination because it generates cash already in the first  
**[0:39:37-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:37):**  year.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:38):**  So you would interbow it basically and put it in between the tree lines or you would  
**[0:39:42-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:42):**  separate the systems.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:43):**  As a portfolio manager, I would have one farm focused on agroforestry and I would have another  
**[0:39:48-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:48):**  farm focused on developing the grains.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:51):**  But if you could mix them, that would be better.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:53):**  But I think trying to keep it simple in the beginning and make sure, I mean, you have  
**[0:39:58-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:39:58):**  a fiduciary responsibility on the capital being deployed.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:02):**  So I think just getting those two things right would be great.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:05):**  The third thing that I mentioned is, yeah, is if the system is going through the shift  
**[0:40:09-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:09):**  of how do we finance this and how do we give the R&D and agronomic advice once the system  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:16):**  is going to change and maybe no longer the chemical companies are going to do this, what  
**[0:40:20-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:20):**  sort of opportunities does this create?  
**[0:40:22-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:22):**  Like we are tackling this in a Brazilian reality of giving agronomic advice and doing the commercial  
**[0:40:28-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:28):**  part.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:29):**  We are still going to tackle the financial part and hopefully one day we'll raise a billion  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:33):**  dollar green bond just to finance these farmers through our platform and also carbon credits.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:38):**  But it creates these sorts of opportunities.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:41):**  And so as an investment, I think it's a nice mix of perennials, annuals and something like  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:46):**  technology or industry transformation opportunity or service.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:51):**  Not just on your land.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:52):**  I think that's the interesting piece I see now.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:54):**  A lot of people are starting to think beyond their own farm gate and with more than their  
**[0:40:59-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:40:59):**  money.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:00):**  Like they've created their piece of paradise and in some cases very big, some cases small,  
**[0:41:03-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:03):**  but it's done really well.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:04):**  And now it's time to, OK, what happens after?  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:07):**  How do I influence first all my neighbors and then the whole region and then the watershed  
**[0:41:11-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:11):**  and the bio region?  
**[0:41:12-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:12):**  Or first of all, thinking, OK, which area of the world or which area of my world is  
**[0:41:16-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:16):**  the most at risk or the most interesting piece to apply regeneration?  
**[0:41:20-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:20):**  Because we have scarce resources.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:21):**  And that's why I asked the question, like, what would you focus on if you only between  
**[0:41:25-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:25):**  brackets and doing brackets had a billion dollars?  
**[0:41:28-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:28):**  You can do a lot, but you cannot do everything, obviously.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:31):**  It's not that much money to change what we want to change.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:33):**  I mean, I think the ambition is much greater.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:36):**  It's a lot of money and more money than many of us have ever seen and maybe will.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:41):**  But at the same time, I see we're not that far off from people entering the space with  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:46):**  that amount of money from institutional investors, from private individuals.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:50):**  Honestly, there are family offices that are managing that kind of capital and getting  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:54):**  interested in the space.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:41:55):**  And I think it's up to us, the space to be ready and build the pieces of infrastructure,  
**[0:42:00-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:00):**  the building blocks, the pipelines to take that money and flood it to the land and make  
**[0:42:05-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:05):**  sure it gets to work as soon as possible, because more and more people are waking up  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:09):**  to the potential here and the need.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:11):**  And more of those are commanding or at some point influencing large amount of capital  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:16):**  coming from the institution, the infrastructure company or the insurance companies, the pension  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:20):**  funds, the large commodity buyers who are getting interested.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:24):**  And yeah, there's capital there.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:26):**  There's not a shortage of capital.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:27):**  There's a shortage of ways to put it to work.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:29):**  And you know how it is in finance.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:30):**  It's easier to move large amounts of capital because it justifies the monitoring costs,  
**[0:42:35-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:35):**  you know, the deployment of this capital.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:37):**  We've had conversations with them.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:38):**  Can you explain that a bit?  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:39):**  Because I've had discussions with people, why is it so much more difficult to raise  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:43):**  1 million or 5 million compared to, in some cases, 50 or 100 million, which sounds counterintuitive.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:48):**  But can you explain from a finance perspective why it makes sense to write bigger checks?  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:52):**  Well, if you're going to invest in something and you put your money in a fund, in a professional  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:42:57):**  investor, and you agree with this fund that you have a fee for them to manage your money,  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:02):**  you know, admin fee and a performance fee.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:05):**  If you're investing a billion dollars and you have a 2% fee, that's $20 million per  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:10):**  year that you have to and you can pay your team and you can do a good job.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:14):**  If you're raising $50 million or $10 million, then the fee either will be too big versus  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:20):**  the size of the amount of capital.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:22):**  Will be more than 2%.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:23):**  Yeah, much more.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:24):**  And a lot of the money, then the investor is not happy that a lot of the money is just  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:27):**  staying within the structure and not being deployed where it's supposed to.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:31):**  So it's easy from a financial mathematical point of view to say, let's raise these huge  
**[0:43:35-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:35):**  funds.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:36):**  And then I am an investor, so I need to make sure that the company is being well run, that  
**[0:43:40-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:40):**  I have all the accounting firms looking at it, all the lawyers making sure everything  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:43):**  and this monitoring has a price.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:46):**  So oftentimes for big institutional investors, it's not worth it to deploy less than $100  
**[0:43:52-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:52):**  million.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:53):**  And it just, we talked to the guys and they say, we love your project, but you know, come  
**[0:43:57-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:57):**  back in three years.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:43:58):**  The way capital flows goes into these funds and they have a minimum ticket size.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:03):**  Yeah, because also that just a research of doing, if you do the research on what the  
**[0:44:08-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:08):**  due diligence and research on one company, if you do an half million investment or 50  
**[0:44:14-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:14):**  million, it doesn't really change that much.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:17):**  It changes a bit, but the price is pretty much the same, which means everybody's going  
**[0:44:20-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:20):**  for obviously the unit economics coming back to that makes much more sense to go upstream,  
**[0:44:25-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:25):**  which is very annoying for a lot of people.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:27):**  I imagine a lot of people listening now thinking, why is that?  
**[0:44:30-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:30):**  Or how do you change that?  
**[0:44:32-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:32):**  But it's the reality of investing.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:34):**  For investors often, you know, investing in two small companies, two smaller company is  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:39):**  a headache because you know, where's the governance?  
**[0:44:41-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:41):**  Where's the, you know, yeah, it's simply impossible, but it's changing.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:44):**  We're learning from, I think the renewable energy space from other, and it's that phase  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:48):**  where we're going through where the $15 million investments are possible, but the 50 are getting  
**[0:44:54-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:54):**  possible and there are some people actually putting to work 200 million in agroforestry.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:44:59):**  Actually, I just recorded with Richard Falken, which should be out before this comes out.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:02):**  So that's good.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:03):**  I will link it below.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:04):**  And so there is movement happening much faster than I predicted, honestly, a year ago, but  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:08):**  it's still where we're really in the early phases of investing in this space, not in  
**[0:45:13-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:13):**  the early phases of the agriculture space, because we all know the gurus.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:16):**  We all know the people that have done it and are continuing to improve a lot and continue  
**[0:45:21-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:21):**  to scale and the work you're doing.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:22):**  But of the investing piece, we're really scratching the surface, but it's very exciting.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:28):**  It's moving very quickly.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:29):**  And I think we'll see more debt because as you know, these farmers prove the unit economics,  
**[0:45:34-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:34):**  then it's easy to raise that, you know.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:35):**  Have you seen that in Brazil?  
**[0:45:37-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:37):**  Like it's, do you get easier or easy debt for farmers in transition?  
**[0:45:41-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:41):**  I mean, you get the normal conditions that you get for conventional farm.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:44):**  Okay.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:45):**  But still, which is great.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:46):**  So you don't have a disadvantage anymore.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:48):**  So now we can go to the bank, the Dutch bank that is our partner.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:52):**  And the first year when they lent us money, I mean, they really took on a risk because  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:45:56):**  we gave them the spiel, we showed them the presentations, we knew how much the pictures  
**[0:46:01-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:01):**  and all that.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:03):**  We had everything.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:04):**  We had the contracts, but then there was like, oh, what about performance risk?  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:06):**  And now we've been performing and now we're just renewing our loans every year.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:10):**  So at least I don't have a disadvantage anymore.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:12):**  But I think as we move forward, it's going to be an advantage.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:17):**  The cost of capital should get to a lower point.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:20):**  And we are in the process of trying to raise the first green bond of its type, you know,  
**[0:46:25-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:25):**  approved by the climate bonds initiative in Brazil.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:27):**  It's not a big thing, like $5 million.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:29):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:30):**  But still, I had Sean Kidney on the call a long time ago.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:34):**  It feels like ages, but I think it was last year.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:36):**  I will link it below.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:37):**  And we're discussing what does it take to get climate bonds, green bonds certified by  
**[0:46:40-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:40):**  the climate initiative into agricultural food.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:42):**  And he was saying, yeah, we haven't looked at organic because honestly, from a climate  
**[0:46:46-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:46):**  perspective, it hasn't been all that great.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:48):**  If we look at the research that's out there, which is very shaky.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:51):**  And so we've been looking and there hasn't been too much.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:53):**  But I'm very happy people are moving in terms of regenerative organic and getting access  
**[0:46:58-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:46:58):**  to the bond market, which is huge.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:00):**  That's just I mean, that's an enormous pot of money.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:03):**  We're going to do a small one and just the fees for emitting this bond.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:06):**  But still just doing it once.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:08):**  That's the...  
**[0:47:09-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:09):**  Just doing one to unblocking this road, right?  
**[0:47:12-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:12):**  But getting the metrics right, I think I agree is key.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:14):**  And you have to measure everything that you're doing.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:17):**  I mean, we are a research farm.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:18):**  We are a 1200 hectare research farm and we measure everything and we have partnerships  
**[0:47:23-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:23):**  with universities here, with Wageningen, with different...  
**[0:47:26-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:26):**  We had a third party certifier come and apply the greenhouse protocol on our farm based  
**[0:47:32-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:32):**  on actual soil data.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:34):**  So not on a model, but based on actually soil on your soil data.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:38):**  That's very interesting.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:39):**  Based on historical soil data, because we've been doing this for a long time.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:44):**  It's based on our historical soil data.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:46):**  So our grain productions and pulses sequester 1.9 tons of CO2 per hectare per year.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:47:55):**  Whereas our conventional neighbors are emitting five, almost six.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:00):**  Wow.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:01):**  So that's almost a seven difference.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:05):**  Because we're not using synthetic nitrogen and because we are building soil at the rate  
**[0:48:09-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:09):**  of 0.01 per year, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it makes a huge, huge difference  
**[0:48:16-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:16):**  in carbon.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:17):**  And just for fun, I mean, I know the number.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:18):**  Well, what's the citrus ones, what are they doing?  
**[0:48:22-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:22):**  The citrus ones is sequestering 46, 45 tons of CO2 per hectare because the citrus besides  
**[0:48:28-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:28):**  the soil creation, there's also the above ground carbon.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:31):**  Yeah, yeah, of course, of course.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:32):**  And it's a perennial.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:34):**  But it's just to show the difference.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:35):**  So 1.9 versus 45.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:37):**  Yes.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:38):**  We need to eat grain, but that's a big difference.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:40):**  And it's interesting because when we looked at this, it's like, yeah, let's continue to  
**[0:48:43-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:43):**  do fruits because even though it's a small area, the impact is multiplied by 30, by 20,  
**[0:48:49-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:49):**  whatever.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:50):**  And but we have 40 million hectares of grains and growing in Brazil.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:53):**  So we need to convert this huge area.  
**[0:48:56-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:56):**  Of course, of course.  
**[0:48:57-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:57):**  But it's a huge, huge area.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:48:59):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:00):**  And this was important, I think, for these initiatives.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:01):**  I know there's a big discussion on carbon and people wanting to create mechanisms to  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:05):**  sell carbon just based on models.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:08):**  But I think where we are now is you need to measure it.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:11):**  I don't think there's any substitution for measuring at the farm.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:14):**  I know.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:15):**  I think every good farmer measures soil organic matter a lot and lots of points on the farm  
**[0:49:20-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:20):**  every year.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:21):**  I think we should just use this data.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:23):**  I know people want to go like the tech.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:25):**  Let me just do something very simple that works for everybody.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:27):**  But it's super controversial.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:29):**  Let's get a satellite to figure it out.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:32):**  It's very risky because I've seen some data on a pilot farm.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:36):**  I still need to interview them.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:37):**  But actually, it's on transition finance, but a pilot farm somewhere, I think, in the  
**[0:49:42-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:42):**  New York area.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:44):**  And they were showing that the sequestration rates in terms of holistic grazing and grains  
**[0:49:48-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:48):**  operations, I might be getting it wrong, but it was a lot higher than any of the models  
**[0:49:52-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:52):**  predicted.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:53):**  So they were saying the models are so far off.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:55):**  We don't know.  
**[0:49:56-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:56):**  I mean, these models are not very accurate.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:49:58):**  And if you want to sell this and get a comfortable market, we might want to base it on real data,  
**[0:50:04-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:04):**  which is tricky.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:05):**  But essentially, I agree.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:06):**  The model part is very difficult in terms of marketplaces in this case.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:11):**  And I applaud them.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:12):**  I bought Nori tokens for offsetting and removing my carbon of last year.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:16):**  And I had them on the podcast.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:17):**  But the fact that it's based on the comet farm, it's tricky for the farmers that are  
**[0:50:23-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:23):**  actually doing this and are measuring it on the ground themselves.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:26):**  That's the data we need also in terms of tweaking the system and getting better.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:31):**  For example, our carbon sequestration was actually bigger.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:34):**  If you look at the soil data, like I have the data here, the agroforestry system, the  
**[0:50:38-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:38):**  soil organic matter increased from 1819 to 1920, increased from 2.7 to 3.3.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:44):**  So that's 0.6.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:47):**  But can we guarantee that this will happen every year?  
**[0:50:49-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:49):**  And you've talked to the soil scientists at Wageningen and they will say, no, you need  
**[0:50:54-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:54):**  longer.  
**[0:50:55-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:55):**  You need historical data, which is much lower.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:50:56):**  You have to be conservative in carbon, lest you do the sector a disfavor and you overpromise  
**[0:51:01-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:01):**  and don't deliver.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:02):**  And the last thing you want is selling well-intentioned people in the city's credits, which then don't  
**[0:51:07-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:07):**  become true.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:08):**  Dangerous, Pete.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:09):**  Yeah, no, absolutely.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:11):**  And what if you, okay, so you're no longer in charge of the $1 billion investment fund,  
**[0:51:16-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:16):**  but you have a magic power.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:17):**  So you can change one thing in the agriculture space, agriculture and food, actually larger  
**[0:51:21-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:21):**  if you want to.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:22):**  What would you do with your magic wand?  
**[0:51:24-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:24):**  What would you change overnight?  
**[0:51:26-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:26):**  The magic wand question.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:27):**  It's a beautiful question.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:29):**  I have to check when I introduced it and how I don't even remember how I come up with it,  
**[0:51:34-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:34):**  but the answers are always interesting.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:36):**  So I keep doing it.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:39):**  I'm going to try to keep it not that creative.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:42):**  I would just strengthen the link between agricultural funding and soil organic matter.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:48):**  That's it.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:49):**  Which is revolutionary.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:50):**  Let's let's not.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:51):**  I mean, any prices of current farmland, et cetera, are never taken into account soil  
**[0:51:55-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:55):**  health or soil organic matter.  
**[0:51:57-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:57):**  So that would be my acupuncture point.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:51:59):**  So if a farmer wants to get a loan, goes to the bank and the bank says, oh, you're doing  
**[0:52:04-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:04):**  great.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:05):**  Here's a cheaper loan.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:06):**  You're doing kind of average.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:07):**  Here's kind of a more expensive loan, or you're not doing great at all.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:11):**  You need to commit to a program to improve your soil or else in two years time, you will  
**[0:52:15-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:15):**  not get any financing from any of the banks because this has to be a coalition.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:20):**  And this would make the farm manager have to look for alternatives and improve the soil  
**[0:52:26-0:52:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:26):**  on the farm.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:27):**  And also, I think there's another important part of the agriculture market, which a lot  
**[0:52:31-0:52:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:31):**  of the land is leased and the owners of the land right now have no incentive.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:35):**  You have two possible tenants, a guy that's doing regenerative and a guy that's there's  
**[0:52:39-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:39):**  no differentiation.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:40):**  As long as they pay, it doesn't matter.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:43):**  Exactly.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:44):**  And oftentimes the loan is linked as a guarantee the production of that land.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:47):**  It's linked to the land.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:49):**  So if a land, a better quality land has cheaper rates, it would impact on the value of the  
**[0:52:54-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:54):**  land and impact on the decision of the landowner and who to lease it out to.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:52:59):**  I think this would be a huge incentive for the sector.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:02):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:03):**  And is that something because it's a question I've been asking a few times now and I haven't  
**[0:53:06-0:53:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:06):**  included in the preparation, but let's wing it.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:09):**  In terms of agriculture, if you look at the whole space, what is the most connected piece?  
**[0:53:17-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:17):**  What is the piece that you see in RegenEgg that very few people are working on, but is  
**[0:53:21-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:21):**  absolutely crucial and absolutely solvable.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:23):**  It comes from the ITN framework, which is importance, tractability, solvability and  
**[0:53:29-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:29):**  neglectedness.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:31):**  And I'm always interested in people that are thinking along those lines.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:34):**  So what is the piece that is very important, very solvable, but nobody's doing it?  
**[0:53:39-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:39):**  Is there something that comes to mind?  
**[0:53:40-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:40):**  Is that this, is it carbon tax?  
**[0:53:42-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:42):**  Is it, I will first do research.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:44):**  What is the piece that is really missing according to you?  
**[0:53:47-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:47):**  I'll fall back to the point of good technical assistance, because it's not replacing one  
**[0:53:54-0:53:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:54):**  type of people who are trying to sell you something with another type of people trying  
**[0:53:58-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:58):**  to sell you something.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:53:59):**  I think farmers really need good, neutral technical assistance.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:02):**  Unfortunately, the extension services of different governments are not capable of doing that.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:09):**  Universities are doing research often that's too far away from farmers.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:12):**  There's two points we discussed with Soil Capital, which I will link below with Nicolas,  
**[0:54:16-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:16):**  very extensively on independent agronomic advice and the university piece with John  
**[0:54:20-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:20):**  Lutgen actually that left the USDA because he said a lot of the research is just way  
**[0:54:25-0:54:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:25):**  behind what's happening on real regenerative farms.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:28):**  So we need to go there and become regenerative farms ourselves as academics and then start  
**[0:54:32-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:32):**  the research again.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:33):**  But farmers first, then research, because what's happening in many universities is just  
**[0:54:37-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:37):**  not the cutting edge.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:38):**  The cutting edge is happening on experimental farms of many cases in very good ways, crazy  
**[0:54:42-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:42):**  farmers.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:43):**  So that's a good, very interesting answer.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:47):**  And interesting seed.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:49):**  So Vahiningen has a program called Lighthouse Farms, where they identified farms that they  
**[0:54:55-0:55:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:54:55):**  say are already in 2050 in terms of combining sustainability and economic performance.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:01):**  And we are one of those farms and we have a forum where we exchange ideas.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:04):**  We want to do this with our farmer network.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:06):**  So getting them together once a year and really exchanging experiences and bringing the university  
**[0:55:11-0:55:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:11):**  to come and complement with knowledge.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:13):**  But really let's discuss what works, what doesn't.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:15):**  And with a very open mind, I mean, agronomy, you need to have different tools that you  
**[0:55:20-0:55:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:20):**  use in different situations, but let's just measure everything.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:23):**  I think this is where the research is now.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:25):**  Like if I have soil compaction and I need to decompact the soil and I need to move the  
**[0:55:30-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:30):**  soil a little bit, how much is this going to set me further back in terms of carbon?  
**[0:55:36-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:36):**  But then if you're taking better care of the plants and these plants will put more exudates  
**[0:55:41-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:41):**  in the ground, how much is that?  
**[0:55:42-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:42):**  So it's all these trade-offs that we are not able to navigate yet.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:45):**  And I think the sector, there's a lot of idealism, which is great, but a lot of dogmas also.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:52):**  And we need better science to be able to navigate this because telling farmer, hey, buy into  
**[0:55:56-0:55:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:56):**  my ideological package.  
**[0:55:58-0:55:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:58):**  That's kind of tough.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:55:59):**  Buy into my scientific package.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:01):**  I think that's much easier.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:03):**  That changes the discussion.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:04):**  Then the final question, the famous final question that I never asked, but then we always  
**[0:56:07-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:07):**  end up two or three.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:09):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't believe to be  
**[0:56:13-0:56:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:13):**  true?  
**[0:56:14-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:14):**  This is definitely inspired by a question John Kempf is often asking in his interview.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:18):**  I think that regenerative agricultural products will become cheaper on a cost per unit basis  
**[0:56:26-0:56:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:26):**  than conventional very, very soon.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:29):**  So if you see the work that we've done, I'll just give you an example why I think that  
**[0:56:34-0:56:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:34):**  if you look at what's happening in biological inputs now, farmers such as us in Brazil,  
**[0:56:39-0:56:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:39):**  we are multiplying bacteria, fungi and viruses on our own farm with stainless steel vats.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:45):**  We have a technician just to do that.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:47):**  But if you have enough hectares, it's not somebody just like pouring into a, like a  
**[0:56:52-0:56:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:52):**  small barrel, but these are massive breweries.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:55):**  Basically.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:56):**  No, we tried that and the contamination is too high and doesn't really work, but we're  
**[0:56:59-0:57:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:56:59):**  doing this in a very high tech way and this is replacing a lot of the chemicals, even  
**[0:57:05-0:57:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:05):**  for the conventional farmers.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:06):**  So it used to be that organic regenerative agriculture had a disadvantage to conventional.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:11):**  A conventional would always be cheaper.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:13):**  Well, guess what?  
**[0:57:14-0:57:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:14):**  The chemicals aren't working as well anymore.  
**[0:57:16-0:57:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:16):**  They're more expensive.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:17):**  So do you see the cost going up there in the conventional piece?  
**[0:57:20-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:20):**  Like do you see these, because I've spoke to farmers, but not in Brazil too much that  
**[0:57:23-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:23):**  are, they started switching because they saw this cost curve creeping up and they saw the  
**[0:57:28-0:57:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:28):**  yield not really going up anymore.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:30):**  So they saw these two lines and were thinking, okay, at some point he's going to touch, which  
**[0:57:34-0:57:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:34):**  then we're in trouble.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:35):**  Do you see that?  
**[0:57:36-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:36):**  Like the, is the cost creeping up of the food and the yield on the pressure?  
**[0:57:39-0:57:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:39):**  Is that happening?  
**[0:57:40-0:57:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:40):**  The cost is going up, the pest pressure is going up.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:42):**  So you need more chemicals, more applications.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:45):**  And this movement is coming not just from the organic farmers, it's coming from the  
**[0:57:48-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:48):**  conventional farmers.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:49):**  It's everywhere.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:50):**  So this is one of the examples, which is leveling the playing field.  
**[0:57:54-0:57:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:54):**  I think on the yield side, and I said cost per unit, right on the yield side, like you  
**[0:57:59-0:58:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:57:59):**  mentioned, I think as the climate changes, we will really see the effect of more resilient  
**[0:58:04-0:58:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:04):**  soils.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:05):**  So, yeah, just a number.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:07):**  I think I checked it yesterday.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:09):**  No, a few days ago.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:11):**  So 19 million acres weren't planted in the US last year due to weather 19,19 and then  
**[0:58:17-0:58:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:17):**  six zeros just for your image weren't even planted because of weather.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:22):**  They were all flooded.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:24):**  The fields were flooded.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:25):**  They look like rice paddies.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:26):**  Some of them.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:27):**  Well, you know, they could have planted rice now.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:29):**  They couldn't.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:30):**  But yeah, but it's just to get the impact of a very wet spring.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:35):**  That's it.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:36):**  19 million acres.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:38):**  So for that year, your yield was zero.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:41):**  You have your fixed costs to pay.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:43):**  So your cost per unit goes up.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:44):**  Right.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:45):**  So and not to mention, I think the bonuses, I'm a, you know, very focused on my business.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:51):**  So I'm not really tracking the carbon thing that close.  
**[0:58:54-0:59:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:58:54):**  I mean, for me, it's an upside, but I don't need the ecosystem services to make my business  
**[0:59:00-0:59:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:00):**  work.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:01):**  But it's coming.  
**[0:59:02-0:59:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:02):**  Yeah, it's coming and it will be great.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:03):**  So that will help it even further.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:04):**  So and I think this is a call out to organic farmers not to be comfortable with the price  
**[0:59:09-0:59:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:09):**  premiums that they get today, because this is a situation where only a few fortunate  
**[0:59:14-0:59:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:14):**  people are able to buy organic.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:16):**  And I think this is not the vision we want to work for.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:18):**  We want to work for a world in which a lot of people, as many as possible, can access  
**[0:59:24-0:59:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:24):**  good quality food and we can do the land right and the farmer right without having and we  
**[0:59:29-0:59:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:29):**  can talk about price and we have to aim there.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:31):**  We have to use all the technology and all the knowledge that we have to do things better  
**[0:59:35-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:35):**  and not just say, you know, people should be paying triple, triple or double the price.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:39):**  I think we can't get to just because it's worth it.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:42):**  No, no, I think it's a good it's a good incentive for the next 10 years that this premium is  
**[0:59:47-0:59:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:47):**  there and it's high and it's helping farmers in the conversion.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:50):**  But in the long run, I think we have to do better.  
**[0:59:53-0:59:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:53):**  I think it's a perfect answer to and I think we have so much more to talk about, but that  
**[0:59:57-0:59:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:57):**  will save that for another one.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=0:59:58):**  I want to thank you, Fabio, so much for your time and sharing and good luck in these extremely  
**[1:00:03-1:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=1:00:03):**  busy times.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=1:00:04):**  I mean, I'm happy you took the time to record as you don't do a lot of interviews because  
**[1:00:08-1:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=1:00:08):**  you're head down working and getting farmers on board and getting hectares converted, which  
**[1:00:13-1:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=1:00:13):**  is on the journey, let's say.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=1:00:15):**  Thank you so much.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=1:00:16):**  Thank you for having me.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=1:00:17):**  I really like the podcast.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=1:00:18):**  I appreciate how you're trying to advance the field while at the same time making it

**[1:03:43-1:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=1:03:43):**  It's not a list of investable deals.

**[1:03:48-1:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=1:03:48):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:03:51-1:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=1:03:51):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/30/fabio-sakamoto#t=1:03:53):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

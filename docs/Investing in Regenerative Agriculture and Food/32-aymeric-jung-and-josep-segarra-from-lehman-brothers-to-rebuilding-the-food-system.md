**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:14):**  You're going to listen to a conversation with Aymeric and Josep working at Quadia Capital.  If you're interested in how to invest in regenerative food and agriculture companies and some nerdy  details, this is your interview.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:25):**  We're discussing how they found the sweet spot to get investors to invest in regenerative  agriculture and food companies by offering them something which falls into their comfort  zone and how they have invested in over 15 companies and the reason they're using flexible  
**[0:00:38-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:38):**  loans.  And what are flexible loans actually?  So enjoy.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:43):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  the planet mattered.  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:53):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:05):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:16):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:29):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more  depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:42):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:02):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the planet mattered.  I'm Kufin Seyin, your host.  And today I'm talking to Amelie Guillaume and Josip Segarra of Guadia Capital, an investment  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:12):**  manager based in Geneva, Switzerland, who invested over 150 million into impact companies,  projects and funds.  Amelie Guillaume joined Guadia to shape its food and agriculture investments.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:22):**  For example, setting up Noriterre, a financing program which supports entrepreneurs in the  agri-food sector, demonstrating a clear alignment to the principles of organic and sustainable  agriculture.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:32):**  I'm really looking forward to this conversation.  I'm going to ask Amelie and Josip everything there is to know about their investment strategy,  their theory of change, their vision and how they put money to work.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:42):**  Welcome Amelie and Josip.  Hello.  Thank you.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:45):**  Good morning.  So to start with a personal question to both of you, actually, and you can decide on your  end who's going to answer it first, how did you end up in the space of food, agriculture  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:54):**  and soil?  So I can start and just to let you know that before working at Guadia, I was working around  20 years on capital markets and the trading room, mainly on the structuring side.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:09):**  So it was really about looking for solutions.  And in 2007, what happened, we had the crisis, food crisis with the pricing going up for  all the food and more and more private equity funds came to my desk, to my team to switch  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:28):**  a solution about buying land and produce food because it was clear that population growing,  pricing going up, it was a key investment 10 years ago.  And on my side, I just found out that having a quantitative solution, which is just producing  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:46):**  more food is not sustainable and it's a short term view about solutions that we should implement.  And step by step, still working at banking, I met a lot of people about agroecology, local  food, regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:03):**  I do think that the solution and I started to be passionate about quality instead of  quantity, logistic instead of just a linear economy where you are producing and then you  waste.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:16):**  And I started to think that we should bring investment to all these new entrepreneurs  who are reinventing the food system.  And that's what I'm doing now with Josep at Quadiar.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:30):**  And in my case is a little bit different.  So I started my practically my career in impact investing based on the idea that something  has to be changed and we don't have a lot of time.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:44):**  So I decided to start directly from university.  So in food and agriculture, of course, as a main theme in impact investing is something  that relates to myself as coming from Spain.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:01):**  Thank you for that introduction.  And so you both joined Quadiar already with in the case of Amelic with a lot of experience  and in the case of Josep with a lot of focus.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:12):**  How has been that journey of setting up that focus on food and agriculture within as already  impact focused wealth manager?  Why were they so keen on focusing on food and agri?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:26):**  At Quadiar it was quite logical to go into this territory because at the beginning, the  first Quadiar partners worked on energy like a lot of impact fund or impact companies and  looking for being more efficient and looking for companies on energy efficiency.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:46):**  And when you really look at what we need today and what's going on, a big waste of energy  is in the food system.  Just all the oil you can use and need for growing the food, then the logistics and transporting  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:02):**  food from one place to all around the world is a big waste of energy.  So it really made sense that the food and improving the food system will finally be  the next step with the first investments in energy.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:23):**  And also because on impact, you know that with the food and the food market, which is  more than 5.5 trillion worldwide, if you can change small things for the environment, for  the social organization, you are really making an impact.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:41):**  And it's always a big change as you have now, I think more than 1.3 billion farmers worldwide  and just a very, very small part is doing modern agriculture.  So it's on impact, it's huge how you can change things when you are doing it with a good intention  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:02):**  and looking for quality instead of quantity.  And you didn't go straight from banking to quality.  You also co-founded Slow Money for the French speaking countries.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:14):**  Can you explain a bit more what you were working on there and what your first discoveries or  first journeys into sustainable food and agriculture and impact investing were like?  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:26):**  So after 2007, I leave 2008 on the banking and I mentioned before I was at Lehman Brothers  so it was really in London at the trading room at my desk leaving the crisis.  So it was not so easy but...  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:42):**  Wow, you were in the first row.  Yeah, exactly.  The Fedless Monday in September.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:48):**  But for me, it was not really sad finally because for one year, I was already interested  by something else.  So I had this passion about how to bring solutions this time not just through derivatives or  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:01):**  pricing but really on the feed with entrepreneurs.  So still at banking for three, four years on my... has an hobby and during my holidays,  I was meeting all these farmers, producers, people trying to improve the food.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:22):**  And now it's more common than 10 years ago.  Today I think you can go to any meeting, dinner, opening a newspaper or TV.  You have a lot of news about food and how food is poisoning us and the planet.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:37):**  Ten years ago, it was really less known by people.  So what is interesting, so I started to do my first investment by myself which were small  investment and step by step bigger investment and then I just heard about slow food, slow  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:54):**  money which is how to save and how to invest in the local food system.  And it was a bridge with philanthropy and also impact investing.  So this world, microfinance as well on emerging market, philanthropy, local food system, impact  
**[0:09:12-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:12):**  investing, you can really find the same people through foundations or philanthropist and  that's how I started to do my first investment.  Very very exciting.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:24):**  And then you started at Quadia and you came up with not only a strategy on private equity,  so direct deals into companies, but also Noritare which is a financing program and is that different  from a fund or can you explain a bit more where that program came from and both of you  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:40):**  and what that actually is so we can dive a bit deeper into that.  First you have to know, I do think you know this, when you are talking with people or  classical investors or bankers about social and environmental finance or impact investing,  
**[0:09:57-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:57):**  you have this thought that it will not be liquid, it will be with a low return or just  an emerging market with high risk and sometimes not really professional doing this kind of  investment.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:13):**  More as a hobby.  Yeah.  Five years ago it was really the case each time you were talking about impact investing  
**[0:10:22-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:22):**  when it was not in green bonds or big energy infrastructures, you had this kind of ideas  by people.  So what we did with Noritare is just trying to find foreign investors ways is comfort  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:39):**  zone.  And the comfort zone is not for investing too long and having a clear view on the potential  return.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:48):**  So we built this program by bringing diversification for the investors and the key was investing  for four years targeting a 4% annual return and already some cash flow after two years  and three years.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:04):**  So when you invest 100, the Noritare program is giving you back 25% after two years, 70%  after three years and full redemption after four years.  So for a lot of investors, it made sense to have diversification, I would say in real  
**[0:11:22-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:22):**  economy in their portfolio and they knew that the return and the timeline of the return  was really clear.  So it's what we call the comfort zone of the investors for them not thinking that it's  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:37):**  too much risky at the beginning.  Yeah, which is very interesting because it touches upon a lot of response I've had in  these podcasts that investors but also fund managers, those are the two main things are  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:52):**  the high barriers to entry.  So you need to bring quite a big investment to enter a lot of funds or into a lot of things  and that liquidity piece.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:00):**  Like it's very unclear in many cases because it's such a long term transition, the food  system when it's coming back.  So tackling that one is absolutely key.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:10):**  And how are you doing that?  How do you make sure that after two years or four years already most of the money or  after four years, all of the money plus the return came back.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:20):**  So we're structuring it in a way that we are only investing in debt in this program.  So we more or less have the portfolio a little bit more is allocated in direct loans to young  companies normally looking for working capital funding.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:36):**  So in growth phases where of course the banks are alternative but they need sometimes quicker  capital and also partners that understand the business and their needs in terms of network  and where they are going at.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:52):**  And the rest of the portfolio is actually allocated to debt funds which give this liquidity  component too.  And of course the way we structure the loans and the repayments match the cash flows that  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:06):**  we want to obtain and reimburse to investors.  So the whole pack allows us to structure it in a way that capital repayment is possible  from year two onwards.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:20):**  So it's roughly a one year period investment and over the four year horizon of the vehicle.  And of course the most tangible part of this is the direct loans to entrepreneurs.  But the funds give us an extra diversification, also geographical because the direct loans  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:43):**  we do mainly in Europe.  And the funds give us this other component and allow us to be present along the value  chain which is also the objective of the of the Noritor program.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:58):**  So I have a lot of follow up questions on this.  To start with the first one, was it easy to find funds, debt funds that fit your strict  criteria on impact and also on the liquidity level?  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:12):**  I mean I know a lot of investors and impact investors I work with are struggling to find  them.  Was that easy for you to allocate 50% of these vehicles to that?  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:21):**  It is not easy, of course.  And you're very right saying that there's few and there's when you are very strict in  in terms of impact and the kind of output that you want to see in such a strategy, your  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:37):**  universe becomes very, very small.  We already at Qari have had for years a fund mandate that has enabled us to select three  for funds to preselect three for funds that then we can use in this kind of strategy.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:52):**  And we're very comfortable with what we have.  The focus is medium term loans and also in working capital, working a lot with cooperatives  also in the trade finance space, pre-export mainly.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:07):**  So there is clearly a focus on the field that has to be demonstrated on years working in  those in those countries and with a big footprint in different crops, etc.  But it's true that there are not a lot of alternatives and that was one of the and is  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:26):**  still one of the challenges for ourselves and for many others.  Now, we started with the first market at 50-50.  So 50 direct investment, 50% through funds.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:40):**  Unfortunately, we dropped one or two funds because they are really struggling for performance  and all direct allocations are performing more.  So the next no-retail, it's more around two-thirds direct allocation and one-third through funds  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:57):**  still for a liquidity and diversification target.  But on the performances, we really have the right network and the right partnership now  for doing more and more direct investment.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:09):**  Yeah, that was going to be my next question.  How do you find these type of direct loans and how does it look like in practice?  So you mentioned and I've seen on the website, it's a flexible loan where you are basically  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:24):**  aligned with the company and I was wondering how that works in practice.  And of course, if you have an example, you can go through how you found them and how  that actually what that means for the company.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:34):**  So first for the deflow, we have some partnership where we are offering co-financing.  So they have their own deflow, could be funds, could be banks, could be asset managers and  we are doing co-financing.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:51):**  And this co-financing, it's mainly basic loans.  Another specificity we have is we are doing index debt.  And index debt means that you are not discussing an interest rate with the entrepreneur.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:04):**  What you explain is you just need a risk premium and the entrepreneur must pay back the debt  with this risk premium.  For example, it could be 20% for three years or three years and a half, which is the maximum  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:17):**  maturity we are doing for our four years program.  And it just means that the entrepreneur is borrowing 100 at the beginning and for one  year there is no cash flow so he can really grow his company.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:33):**  We don't need some cash back for the first year.  To really put the money to work.  Yeah.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:39):**  And after or sometimes just starting redemption to the bank or other partners and not Quadiar.  But after one year, every six months, he will pay back a percentage of his gross sales.  So it means if the company is more successful than what we checked on the business plan,  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:59):**  instead of three or 3.5 years, they will be able to redeem after two years and it will  be a high return for us.  But it's a high return you are doing thanks to the company's success, not because you  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:11):**  were negotiating at the beginning high interest rate.  So by doing this way, a lot of entrepreneur understand that perhaps the price of capital  would be higher but it's always cheaper than equity but could be higher at just interest  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:27):**  rate.  But they are happy to share this because it's higher because they are more successful.  Because I love these models royalty based, indexed, revenue based, everything that aligns  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:40):**  the investor with the entrepreneur instead of basically putting them on two different  sides of the table and negotiating as tough as possible.  What's the response from companies as many are probably fixed to either doing debt very  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:55):**  strictly or equity?  What's their response normally when you come to the table and say there are many in between  options between those two tools?  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:05):**  That's a very good question actually, because it is true that some companies, especially  when they're young and they're starting the first years, they don't really consider debt  as an option.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:15):**  We try to explain and I think we've been successful seeing that it is indeed an option to complement  an equity round or bank financing for instance.  And it's an intelligent way to put it too because we are able to be more flexible than  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:31):**  a bank and structure it in an intelligent way.  So it has been very well adopted by entrepreneurs that we're working with.  We've financed now more than 15 companies in this space, some of them younger, some  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:46):**  of them are more consolidated, but all of them with a clear objective of growing their  business and with increasing working capital needs.  So there is the sweet spot is there if you wish.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:00):**  And of course, it is true that there is also a pricing issue that we have to overcome.  There's bank alternatives, but entrepreneurs also appreciate a lot being in the Quadia  network and being alongside somebody that even if he is invested in debt, is able to  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:22):**  bring something different.  And that's a clear value add I think.  And in terms of the investors that you might be co-investing with or the equity investors  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:35):**  or the banks that are in the same round or helping the company in the same moment, how  are they responding to these type of tools?  I would say very positively because they see another actor coming into the table.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:50):**  Of course, it's complementary to a bank.  It gives the sense that the company is going in the right direction, especially if the  impact strategies is there and is clear.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:03):**  And from the banking perspective, it is too reassuring that another player is supporting  the company.  And from an equity investor perspective, it's of course, non-dilutive.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:15):**  So there's also this attractive part of it, which we ourselves want to it's also a way  for us to screen companies to see how they advanced and why not consider an equity investment  in the future.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:32):**  It's also a way to get to know the company's work with them before you might consider a  long-term equity investment.  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:38):**  And you know, we are bringing a network, we are bringing knowledge on the food sectors  partnership.  We can find some partners for them on the value chain.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:49):**  So it's a lot of work on the field.  It's not just the financing.  Yeah, you bring a lot more.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:54):**  You bring smart money to the table.  And impact.  We are driving their impact.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:58):**  We are driving their value chain and we are really looking at how they can improve their  process to match our impact requirements.  Extremely interesting.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:09):**  And then my final question on technical details, and then we go, we zoom out a bit.  For investors that invested in the vehicle in Noriter, can they co-invest as well in  individual deals or as I can imagine, that might be interesting.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:24):**  Can they see some impact funds that are moving that direction already offering, but not everyone.  So I was wondering if that option exists here.  It's something we are starting this year.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:35):**  So we are doing, our deal flow is growing.  And when we have higher investment, for example, five to six million in a company, we are doing  club deals.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:47):**  So we are bringing money to the company.  Could be a mix of equity and debt.  And one part of this debt could be also with Noriter program.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:58):**  We can share it and has an example.  The next investments we are doing.  Some people started with us, I would say with average size investments through Noriter program.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:10):**  Now they are going into equity directly to new companies we are investing in.  So it's also a learning curve for our investors starting with Noriter.  Their comfort zone, comfortable program and now ready to go to more private equity deals  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:28):**  because they are confident in our expertise and the companies we are bringing for investment.  And in terms of impact, which what you mentioned before, what are you measuring in terms of  impact of Cordia direct deals, but also Noriter?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:45):**  We don't measure anymore.  It's how we want.  So you used to do it.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:50):**  Yeah, exactly.  So we have our own methodology, but sharing this methodology with basic KPIs people can  use.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:00):**  But before we had this QWIM one, which is Cordia impact measurement, and we change it  to Cordia impact management.  It means now we want to be more and more active investors, even when we are doing loan or  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:16):**  debt to the company.  So it's not just about looking at the company and if the company is doing it well, it's  really how we can manage the company or how we can bring ideas or action into the company  
**[0:24:31-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:31):**  to being better on the value chain and mainly I would say with the circular economy approach.  A lot of people can and entrepreneurs could see sustainability like, you know, kind of  regulations are not really business oriented.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:48):**  But when you are discussing about externalities and circular economy, entrepreneurs can really  feel that it's an opportunity.  It will bring more efficiency to the company.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:59):**  It will bring the company to be also more profitable.  So more than measurement, what I try to explain is now we are working on impact with the company  to show them that it would be better for their value chain and better also for the profitability  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:17):**  and for us the impact will be linked to the success of the economy of the company.  If you are a small company, you are doing a great product but with a good impact and  you are not selling it, you don't have a big impact.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:31):**  If you can have a great product and selling it well, product or services, then you are  doing this impact.  And that's how we put all our work now in what we will call the regenerative economy  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:44):**  because we do think it's too late for being just sustainable.  We really need to rebuild with a bottom-up approach the economy we are looking for and  the economy we like.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:55):**  And what's a nice example you can talk about from the current vehicle that's active that  really embodies this also impact measurement to impact management but also in terms of  the loan, etcetera, and the loan approach.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:26:11):**  What's a nice example you would like to share?  I think a good example, for instance, in the Noritaire program, so when debt is a company  called Boussoul in France, which is a network of socially minded bakeries along France,  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:26:27):**  started as a social project in the economic socialite solidare.  So a clear social approach but with a business that makes sense and a whole approach which  is very, very interesting.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:26:42):**  So they're basically employing employees with difficulties in the market that are in risk  of being excluded from the labor market.  And they're putting them to work in bakeries doing organic bread, selling directly to big  
**[0:27:03-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:03):**  customers.  So with volume customers, canteens, schools, residences, etcetera, that are able to bring  a certain volume.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:14):**  They have been quite successful in different cities in France and we've financed the opening  of one of the network, the branches, and we're willing to do more because we see that the  model is working and their approach can further be improved in terms of the transport, for  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:37):**  instance, to customers passing to electric cars, etcetera.  These are all things that we're already looking at with them.  The production process is very important too.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:48):**  The sourcing of the raw materials in the production, the use of plastics.  There are several points, the management of waste too, very important.  They're trying to minimize that.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:03):**  So there we see that we can very much have a holistic approach with them.  I would say it's a very nice example to what we try to do, both in equity and debt, because  this is of course an approach that we take with all companies in our portfolio.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:23):**  And what are you busy with right now?  We're talking February 2018.  What's the main thing that's on your mind at this moment that you're busy with this  
**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:35):**  week and today as well?  So we are increasing our new retail programs and at the same time direct investment in  companies.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:44):**  So now we have for Q1, we are investing in five food companies and four are in Europe.  One is on emerging countries.  So these companies, we can really bring funds to the company, what I just explained before,  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:29:01):**  either directly or through our programs.  So that's really how we can combine entrepreneurs' needs and what investors are looking for in  terms of returns.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:29:16):**  We are really, I do think we are really a bridge, able to make these two worlds matching  and meeting and being both very happy of what they are doing.  And what we explained in our last new retail report, it's another set value, performance,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:29:38):**  a chart or diversification in a portfolio cannot express all, I will not say the gratitude,  but really the happiness of entrepreneurs when they can work with some people, supporting  them, understanding the business, trying to look at what is the second bounce of the ball,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:29:59):**  what is the business in five years, 10 years, how they will manage externalities and not  being just a fund or a bank expecting an exit or waiting for the debt coming back.  So I would say we are working on a kind of growth for Quadia, more deals, more investment,  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:30:22):**  but also without losing our priority, which is the quality of the business we are doing  and the quality of the funding we bring to companies.  And is that something, because five years ago and especially 10 years ago when you first  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:30:38):**  started looking at this space, have you seen a lot of change in terms of the entrepreneurs?  I mean, you mentioned that there's a lot more focus on food, but do you see finally those  two worlds of agriculture and food and impact investing, are they coming closer?  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:30:52):**  Do you see any signs, not just in your daily work, but also outside that?  Yes, it's really big changes because 10 years ago or even five years ago, it was considered  by investors or also by politics or by people on economics or just, I would say, leaders,  
**[0:31:15-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:31:15):**  it would be considered like you can do some philanthropy, you can be an utopist or a dreamer  on your side trying to do good food, good quality and good farming, but that's it.  And the big money, the big investment is still maximizing the profit.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:31:33):**  And now I do think more and more people understand that we have to build the futures we need  and not just maximizing the profit.  And it's just an example, but beginning of the year, having a letter from the CEO, Blackrock  
**[0:31:53-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:31:53):**  CEO, Larry Fink, explaining that the company must have a social role where governments  fail to really bring a better living conditions to a lot of people.  I do think it's very strong.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:08):**  So as a summary, I would say 10 years ago, people didn't understand what I was doing  or they just thought that it was for being busy during the weekend.  And now they can really understand it's a new economy we are building.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:24):**  And like internet 20 years ago, it was just a small part of the economy, but could be  growing and they want to be part of this economy.  And what do you see as the main barriers?  
**[0:32:35-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:35):**  Because I see a lot of signs as well.  I saw the announcement of Danone last week, where one of their main line of credits is  going to be the return they have to pay or the cost they have to pay on that is going  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:47):**  to be connected to their ESG performance.  And that's not a small one because it's $2 billion.  So they're starting even cost of capital is becoming less if you perform well on sustainability,  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:59):**  which is very interesting.  But what are the main barriers that you think for?  Let's say there's a room full of impact investors who are very interested in food and agriculture  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:10):**  who have read the books about soil and about local communities, and they want to get into  this, but they don't know where to start.  What do you feel as an expert in this space as a two main barriers for this?  
**[0:33:22-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:22):**  I think the two main barriers are first, you have to understand as a consumer, but also  as a distributor producer, that food is not a basic product.  It's not like a smartphone or TV or anything.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:39):**  It's about life and it's about a cycle you need to protect or you need to regenerate.  So it means it takes time.  So I would say the two main barriers is understanding that the price and the cost is not everything,  
**[0:33:58-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:58):**  because we are talking about food and life.  And the other barrier is being able to have a long term view.  You cannot just look at one year cycle or six month cycle.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:10):**  But the good thing is not yet, but where you can really have a good perspective and being  optimistic.  It's even if it looks more expensive, you have a way to arrange the price for having  
**[0:34:23-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:23):**  quality food, not too expensive, just if you reduce your animal product consumption, for  example.  And the key for us is externalities.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:34):**  Once people would understand that someone has to pay for externalities, now you will  not have any more barrier because it will be very logical that people doing well with  less damage, so less externalities, they will compete better and they will have more autonomy  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:55):**  and residency on their value chain.  So that's our bet for not having any more barrier.  But now it's clear that long term view, the time you need to spend and the first cost,  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:12):**  it's the main issues for being mainstream.  And where would you, both of you actually, if a new impact investor or new to the space,  where would you start?  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:23):**  What would be your advice to get active in this space?  Two ways.  Either you want really to start, I would say, in emerging countries and you know, we cannot  
**[0:35:36-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:36):**  just be a happy consumer or happy investors because we are paying the fair trade.  Fair trade is not enough.  You really need to work on the value chain on these countries and to create jobs and  
**[0:35:49-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:49):**  to create autonomy to these countries.  So could be a first approach.  And the other approach is really about investing in the good companies in Europe, for example,  
**[0:35:59-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:59):**  doing the right product and just being sure that they can distribute the product and they  have to educate the consumers that the price is not everything.  So by having the right communications with all the scientific studies we know now about  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:36:22):**  very processed food or pesticide, you know, it's just a cycle.  So you need to invest or you need to put your money where you will educate the consumer  for traceability, for example, and at the same time where you will be able to support  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:36:37):**  the producer for being sure they will keep going on doing the quality.  And apparently it's what Danone is starting.  I would add, we need to consume that product too and start from the beginning, which is  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:36:53):**  making sure that we understand the approach in terms of consumption and in terms of what  we want us as consumers to have.  We see more products of that type.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:05):**  We of course are going to see more investment too coming in.  And do you see, and this is really my final question.  I always say that, but then I have five others.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:13):**  Do you see a role for us as consumers?  And in that case, most of us aren't accredited investors and are retail investors.  Do you see a role for the consumers and in not just between brackets being the consumer  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:27):**  of the product, but also a more active role in the company?  You see a lot of crowdfunding, crowdfunding coming up.  What's your medium to long term vision on that?  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:35):**  Of course, that is I think key.  So if financing actors see that crowdfunding, inequity and in-depth crowd lending make sense  and is working, which we already see, this is a big push in terms of what the customer  
**[0:37:52-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:52):**  is looking for and what he's able and willing to finance from a micro perspective.  But it's a fantastic way to start.  That is only a clear sign that more money needs to be put in the space.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:09):**  And it's a starting point also for more institutional investors to look at the area and really make  a difference with more capital and more scalability, which they of course bring.  And would these royalty or indexed based loans?  
**[0:38:31-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:31):**  To me they seem perfect for crowd lending.  But what do you think about that?  Yes, they are totally in line with an approach that you would see in crowd lending.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:41):**  We know several examples that kind of go towards that direction.  I think it has to be made understandable for retail investors, let's say.  And it has to be simple.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:54):**  It has to be also it has to make sense for companies.  They need to understand and feel that the mechanism works in terms of finding the right  incentives, etc.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:39:11):**  The timing is very important.  We need to be with and maturities at horizons that make sense and not every company has  the same kind of horizon.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:39:22):**  So but that is clearly one approach that works for micro funding, let's say.  And that is also the but it is also scalable as we've done it ourselves and you're able  to start from small and come to a more critical size in the future.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:39:45):**  Thank you so much for that.  I want to thank you for your time and be conscious of it.  So I'm going to end the conversation here.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:39:50):**  There's so much more to discuss, but we'll definitely check in again and see how the  different versions of Notitator are going, how the different vehicles and of course also  on your your equity investments.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:40:02):**  Thank you both, Amrit and Joseph so much for your time this morning.

**[0:41:28-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:41:28):**  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question,  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:41:38):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:41:48-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:41:48):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?

**[0:42:00-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:42:00):**  How to approach this space for whom is this course?  You the soil builders and investors in the space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:42:13):**  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  owners, holistic management, consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:42:25):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  et cetera.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:42:36):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:42:40):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  that among the listeners of this podcast and we have people with very different means.  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:42:55-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:42:55):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:43:00):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:43:13-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:43:13):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:43:25):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:43:39):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:43:44):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:43:55-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:43:55):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.  Click on the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

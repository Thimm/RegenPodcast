**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:58):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:03):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:05):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:09):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:12):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:16):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:17):**  projects and funds.

**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:22):**  For example, setting up Noriterre, a financing program which supports entrepreneurs in the  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:27):**  agri-food sector, demonstrating a clear alignment to the principles of organic and sustainable  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:31):**  agriculture.

**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:38):**  their theory of change, their vision and how they put money to work.

**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:43):**  Hello.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:44):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:45):**  Good morning.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:46):**  So to start with a personal question to both of you, actually, and you can decide on your  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:50):**  end who's going to answer it first, how did you end up in the space of food, agriculture  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:54):**  and soil?  
**[0:02:55-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:55):**  So I can start and just to let you know that before working at Guadia, I was working around  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:03):**  20 years on capital markets and the trading room, mainly on the structuring side.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:09):**  So it was really about looking for solutions.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:12):**  And in 2007, what happened, we had the crisis, food crisis with the pricing going up for  
**[0:03:19-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:19):**  all the food and more and more private equity funds came to my desk, to my team to switch  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:28):**  a solution about buying land and produce food because it was clear that population growing,  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:35):**  pricing going up, it was a key investment 10 years ago.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:39):**  And on my side, I just found out that having a quantitative solution, which is just producing  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:46):**  more food is not sustainable and it's a short term view about solutions that we should implement.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:53):**  And step by step, still working at banking, I met a lot of people about agroecology, local  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:00):**  food, regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:03):**  I do think that the solution and I started to be passionate about quality instead of  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:09):**  quantity, logistic instead of just a linear economy where you are producing and then you  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:15):**  waste.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:16):**  And I started to think that we should bring investment to all these new entrepreneurs  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:23):**  who are reinventing the food system.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:25):**  And that's what I'm doing now with Josep at Quadiar.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:30):**  And in my case is a little bit different.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:32):**  So I started my practically my career in impact investing based on the idea that something  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:41):**  has to be changed and we don't have a lot of time.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:44):**  So I decided to start directly from university.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:51):**  So in food and agriculture, of course, as a main theme in impact investing is something  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:56):**  that relates to myself as coming from Spain.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:01):**  Thank you for that introduction.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:03):**  And so you both joined Quadiar already with in the case of Amelic with a lot of experience  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:09):**  and in the case of Josep with a lot of focus.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:12):**  How has been that journey of setting up that focus on food and agriculture within as already  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:20):**  impact focused wealth manager?  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:22):**  Why were they so keen on focusing on food and agri?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:26):**  At Quadiar it was quite logical to go into this territory because at the beginning, the  
**[0:05:32-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:32):**  first Quadiar partners worked on energy like a lot of impact fund or impact companies and  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:41):**  looking for being more efficient and looking for companies on energy efficiency.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:46):**  And when you really look at what we need today and what's going on, a big waste of energy  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:52):**  is in the food system.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:54):**  Just all the oil you can use and need for growing the food, then the logistics and transporting  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:02):**  food from one place to all around the world is a big waste of energy.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:08):**  So it really made sense that the food and improving the food system will finally be  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:18):**  the next step with the first investments in energy.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:23):**  And also because on impact, you know that with the food and the food market, which is  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:29):**  more than 5.5 trillion worldwide, if you can change small things for the environment, for  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:36):**  the social organization, you are really making an impact.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:41):**  And it's always a big change as you have now, I think more than 1.3 billion farmers worldwide  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:49):**  and just a very, very small part is doing modern agriculture.  
**[0:06:53-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:53):**  So it's on impact, it's huge how you can change things when you are doing it with a good intention  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:02):**  and looking for quality instead of quantity.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:05):**  And you didn't go straight from banking to quality.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:11):**  You also co-founded Slow Money for the French speaking countries.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:14):**  Can you explain a bit more what you were working on there and what your first discoveries or  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:21):**  first journeys into sustainable food and agriculture and impact investing were like?  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:25):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:26):**  So after 2007, I leave 2008 on the banking and I mentioned before I was at Lehman Brothers  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:35):**  so it was really in London at the trading room at my desk leaving the crisis.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:40):**  So it was not so easy but...  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:42):**  Wow, you were in the first row.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:44):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:46):**  The Fedless Monday in September.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:48):**  But for me, it was not really sad finally because for one year, I was already interested  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:53):**  by something else.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:54):**  So I had this passion about how to bring solutions this time not just through derivatives or  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:01):**  pricing but really on the feed with entrepreneurs.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:05):**  So still at banking for three, four years on my... has an hobby and during my holidays,  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:15):**  I was meeting all these farmers, producers, people trying to improve the food.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:22):**  And now it's more common than 10 years ago.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:25):**  Today I think you can go to any meeting, dinner, opening a newspaper or TV.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:30):**  You have a lot of news about food and how food is poisoning us and the planet.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:37):**  Ten years ago, it was really less known by people.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:41):**  So what is interesting, so I started to do my first investment by myself which were small  
**[0:08:47-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:47):**  investment and step by step bigger investment and then I just heard about slow food, slow  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:54):**  money which is how to save and how to invest in the local food system.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:59):**  And it was a bridge with philanthropy and also impact investing.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:05):**  So this world, microfinance as well on emerging market, philanthropy, local food system, impact  
**[0:09:12-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:12):**  investing, you can really find the same people through foundations or philanthropist and  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:19):**  that's how I started to do my first investment.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:23):**  Very very exciting.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:24):**  And then you started at Quadia and you came up with not only a strategy on private equity,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:29):**  so direct deals into companies, but also Noritare which is a financing program and is that different  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:35):**  from a fund or can you explain a bit more where that program came from and both of you  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:40):**  and what that actually is so we can dive a bit deeper into that.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:45):**  First you have to know, I do think you know this, when you are talking with people or  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:50):**  classical investors or bankers about social and environmental finance or impact investing,  
**[0:09:57-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:57):**  you have this thought that it will not be liquid, it will be with a low return or just  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:06):**  an emerging market with high risk and sometimes not really professional doing this kind of  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:11):**  investment.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:13):**  More as a hobby.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:15):**  Five years ago it was really the case each time you were talking about impact investing  
**[0:10:22-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:22):**  when it was not in green bonds or big energy infrastructures, you had this kind of ideas  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:32):**  by people.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:33):**  So what we did with Noritare is just trying to find foreign investors ways is comfort  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:39):**  zone.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:40):**  And the comfort zone is not for investing too long and having a clear view on the potential  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:47):**  return.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:48):**  So we built this program by bringing diversification for the investors and the key was investing  
**[0:10:56-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:10:56):**  for four years targeting a 4% annual return and already some cash flow after two years  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:03):**  and three years.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:04):**  So when you invest 100, the Noritare program is giving you back 25% after two years, 70%  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:12):**  after three years and full redemption after four years.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:16):**  So for a lot of investors, it made sense to have diversification, I would say in real  
**[0:11:22-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:22):**  economy in their portfolio and they knew that the return and the timeline of the return  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:29):**  was really clear.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:30):**  So it's what we call the comfort zone of the investors for them not thinking that it's  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:37):**  too much risky at the beginning.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:39):**  Yeah, which is very interesting because it touches upon a lot of response I've had in  
**[0:11:44-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:44):**  these podcasts that investors but also fund managers, those are the two main things are  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:52):**  the high barriers to entry.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:55):**  So you need to bring quite a big investment to enter a lot of funds or into a lot of things  
**[0:11:59-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:11:59):**  and that liquidity piece.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:00):**  Like it's very unclear in many cases because it's such a long term transition, the food  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:06):**  system when it's coming back.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:07):**  So tackling that one is absolutely key.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:10):**  And how are you doing that?  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:12):**  How do you make sure that after two years or four years already most of the money or  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:16):**  after four years, all of the money plus the return came back.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:20):**  So we're structuring it in a way that we are only investing in debt in this program.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:25):**  So we more or less have the portfolio a little bit more is allocated in direct loans to young  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:32):**  companies normally looking for working capital funding.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:36):**  So in growth phases where of course the banks are alternative but they need sometimes quicker  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:42):**  capital and also partners that understand the business and their needs in terms of network  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:49):**  and where they are going at.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:52):**  And the rest of the portfolio is actually allocated to debt funds which give this liquidity  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:12:59):**  component too.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:00):**  And of course the way we structure the loans and the repayments match the cash flows that  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:06):**  we want to obtain and reimburse to investors.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:10):**  So the whole pack allows us to structure it in a way that capital repayment is possible  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:18):**  from year two onwards.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:20):**  So it's roughly a one year period investment and over the four year horizon of the vehicle.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:28):**  And of course the most tangible part of this is the direct loans to entrepreneurs.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:37):**  But the funds give us an extra diversification, also geographical because the direct loans  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:43):**  we do mainly in Europe.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:46):**  And the funds give us this other component and allow us to be present along the value  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:52):**  chain which is also the objective of the of the Noritor program.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:13:58):**  So I have a lot of follow up questions on this.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:01):**  To start with the first one, was it easy to find funds, debt funds that fit your strict  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:07):**  criteria on impact and also on the liquidity level?  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:12):**  I mean I know a lot of investors and impact investors I work with are struggling to find  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:17):**  them.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:18):**  Was that easy for you to allocate 50% of these vehicles to that?  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:21):**  It is not easy, of course.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:24):**  And you're very right saying that there's few and there's when you are very strict in  
**[0:14:30-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:30):**  in terms of impact and the kind of output that you want to see in such a strategy, your  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:37):**  universe becomes very, very small.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:40):**  We already at Qari have had for years a fund mandate that has enabled us to select three  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:47):**  for funds to preselect three for funds that then we can use in this kind of strategy.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:52):**  And we're very comfortable with what we have.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:14:56):**  The focus is medium term loans and also in working capital, working a lot with cooperatives  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:03):**  also in the trade finance space, pre-export mainly.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:07):**  So there is clearly a focus on the field that has to be demonstrated on years working in  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:17):**  those in those countries and with a big footprint in different crops, etc.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:22):**  But it's true that there are not a lot of alternatives and that was one of the and is  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:26):**  still one of the challenges for ourselves and for many others.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:31):**  Now, we started with the first market at 50-50.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:36):**  So 50 direct investment, 50% through funds.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:40):**  Unfortunately, we dropped one or two funds because they are really struggling for performance  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:47):**  and all direct allocations are performing more.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:50):**  So the next no-retail, it's more around two-thirds direct allocation and one-third through funds  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:15:57):**  still for a liquidity and diversification target.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:01):**  But on the performances, we really have the right network and the right partnership now  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:07):**  for doing more and more direct investment.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:09):**  Yeah, that was going to be my next question.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:12):**  How do you find these type of direct loans and how does it look like in practice?  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:18):**  So you mentioned and I've seen on the website, it's a flexible loan where you are basically  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:24):**  aligned with the company and I was wondering how that works in practice.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:27):**  And of course, if you have an example, you can go through how you found them and how  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:31):**  that actually what that means for the company.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:34):**  So first for the deflow, we have some partnership where we are offering co-financing.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:41):**  So they have their own deflow, could be funds, could be banks, could be asset managers and  
**[0:16:50-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:50):**  we are doing co-financing.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:51):**  And this co-financing, it's mainly basic loans.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:55):**  Another specificity we have is we are doing index debt.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:16:59):**  And index debt means that you are not discussing an interest rate with the entrepreneur.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:04):**  What you explain is you just need a risk premium and the entrepreneur must pay back the debt  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:10):**  with this risk premium.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:11):**  For example, it could be 20% for three years or three years and a half, which is the maximum  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:17):**  maturity we are doing for our four years program.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:22):**  And it just means that the entrepreneur is borrowing 100 at the beginning and for one  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:28):**  year there is no cash flow so he can really grow his company.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:33):**  We don't need some cash back for the first year.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:36):**  To really put the money to work.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:39):**  And after or sometimes just starting redemption to the bank or other partners and not Quadiar.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:46):**  But after one year, every six months, he will pay back a percentage of his gross sales.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:53):**  So it means if the company is more successful than what we checked on the business plan,  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:17:59):**  instead of three or 3.5 years, they will be able to redeem after two years and it will  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:03):**  be a high return for us.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:06):**  But it's a high return you are doing thanks to the company's success, not because you  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:11):**  were negotiating at the beginning high interest rate.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:14):**  So by doing this way, a lot of entrepreneur understand that perhaps the price of capital  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:21):**  would be higher but it's always cheaper than equity but could be higher at just interest  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:27):**  rate.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:28):**  But they are happy to share this because it's higher because they are more successful.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:33):**  Because I love these models royalty based, indexed, revenue based, everything that aligns  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:40):**  the investor with the entrepreneur instead of basically putting them on two different  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:44):**  sides of the table and negotiating as tough as possible.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:48):**  What's the response from companies as many are probably fixed to either doing debt very  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:55):**  strictly or equity?  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:18:58):**  What's their response normally when you come to the table and say there are many in between  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:01):**  options between those two tools?  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:05):**  That's a very good question actually, because it is true that some companies, especially  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:09):**  when they're young and they're starting the first years, they don't really consider debt  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:13):**  as an option.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:15):**  We try to explain and I think we've been successful seeing that it is indeed an option to complement  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:21):**  an equity round or bank financing for instance.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:25):**  And it's an intelligent way to put it too because we are able to be more flexible than  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:31):**  a bank and structure it in an intelligent way.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:35):**  So it has been very well adopted by entrepreneurs that we're working with.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:42):**  We've financed now more than 15 companies in this space, some of them younger, some  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:46):**  of them are more consolidated, but all of them with a clear objective of growing their  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:53):**  business and with increasing working capital needs.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:19:57):**  So there is the sweet spot is there if you wish.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:00):**  And of course, it is true that there is also a pricing issue that we have to overcome.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:08):**  There's bank alternatives, but entrepreneurs also appreciate a lot being in the Quadia  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:15):**  network and being alongside somebody that even if he is invested in debt, is able to  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:22):**  bring something different.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:25):**  And that's a clear value add I think.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:28):**  And in terms of the investors that you might be co-investing with or the equity investors  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:35):**  or the banks that are in the same round or helping the company in the same moment, how  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:39):**  are they responding to these type of tools?  
**[0:20:42-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:42):**  I would say very positively because they see another actor coming into the table.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:50):**  Of course, it's complementary to a bank.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:54):**  It gives the sense that the company is going in the right direction, especially if the  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:20:58):**  impact strategies is there and is clear.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:03):**  And from the banking perspective, it is too reassuring that another player is supporting  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:09):**  the company.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:10):**  And from an equity investor perspective, it's of course, non-dilutive.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:15):**  So there's also this attractive part of it, which we ourselves want to it's also a way  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:24):**  for us to screen companies to see how they advanced and why not consider an equity investment  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:30):**  in the future.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:32):**  It's also a way to get to know the company's work with them before you might consider a  
**[0:21:36-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:36):**  long-term equity investment.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:37):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:38):**  And you know, we are bringing a network, we are bringing knowledge on the food sectors  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:43):**  partnership.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:44):**  We can find some partners for them on the value chain.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:49):**  So it's a lot of work on the field.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:51):**  It's not just the financing.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:52):**  Yeah, you bring a lot more.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:54):**  You bring smart money to the table.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:56):**  And impact.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:57):**  We are driving their impact.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:21:58):**  We are driving their value chain and we are really looking at how they can improve their  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:03):**  process to match our impact requirements.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:08):**  Extremely interesting.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:09):**  And then my final question on technical details, and then we go, we zoom out a bit.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:14):**  For investors that invested in the vehicle in Noriter, can they co-invest as well in  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:20):**  individual deals or as I can imagine, that might be interesting.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:24):**  Can they see some impact funds that are moving that direction already offering, but not everyone.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:30):**  So I was wondering if that option exists here.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:33):**  It's something we are starting this year.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:35):**  So we are doing, our deal flow is growing.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:39):**  And when we have higher investment, for example, five to six million in a company, we are doing  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:46):**  club deals.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:47):**  So we are bringing money to the company.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:49):**  Could be a mix of equity and debt.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:53):**  And one part of this debt could be also with Noriter program.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:22:58):**  We can share it and has an example.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:01):**  The next investments we are doing.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:04):**  Some people started with us, I would say with average size investments through Noriter program.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:10):**  Now they are going into equity directly to new companies we are investing in.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:17):**  So it's also a learning curve for our investors starting with Noriter.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:22):**  Their comfort zone, comfortable program and now ready to go to more private equity deals  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:28):**  because they are confident in our expertise and the companies we are bringing for investment.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:35):**  And in terms of impact, which what you mentioned before, what are you measuring in terms of  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:40):**  impact of Cordia direct deals, but also Noriter?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:45):**  We don't measure anymore.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:47):**  It's how we want.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:49):**  So you used to do it.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:50):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:51):**  So we have our own methodology, but sharing this methodology with basic KPIs people can  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:23:59):**  use.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:00):**  But before we had this QWIM one, which is Cordia impact measurement, and we change it  
**[0:24:08-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:08):**  to Cordia impact management.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:10):**  It means now we want to be more and more active investors, even when we are doing loan or  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:16):**  debt to the company.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:18):**  So it's not just about looking at the company and if the company is doing it well, it's  
**[0:24:23-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:23):**  really how we can manage the company or how we can bring ideas or action into the company  
**[0:24:31-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:31):**  to being better on the value chain and mainly I would say with the circular economy approach.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:40):**  A lot of people can and entrepreneurs could see sustainability like, you know, kind of  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:45):**  regulations are not really business oriented.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:48):**  But when you are discussing about externalities and circular economy, entrepreneurs can really  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:53):**  feel that it's an opportunity.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:55):**  It will bring more efficiency to the company.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:24:59):**  It will bring the company to be also more profitable.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:02):**  So more than measurement, what I try to explain is now we are working on impact with the company  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:10):**  to show them that it would be better for their value chain and better also for the profitability  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:17):**  and for us the impact will be linked to the success of the economy of the company.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:23):**  If you are a small company, you are doing a great product but with a good impact and  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:27):**  you are not selling it, you don't have a big impact.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:31):**  If you can have a great product and selling it well, product or services, then you are  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:36):**  doing this impact.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:38):**  And that's how we put all our work now in what we will call the regenerative economy  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:44):**  because we do think it's too late for being just sustainable.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:48):**  We really need to rebuild with a bottom-up approach the economy we are looking for and  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:53):**  the economy we like.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:25:55):**  And what's a nice example you can talk about from the current vehicle that's active that  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:26:04):**  really embodies this also impact measurement to impact management but also in terms of  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:26:09):**  the loan, etcetera, and the loan approach.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:26:11):**  What's a nice example you would like to share?  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:26:13):**  I think a good example, for instance, in the Noritaire program, so when debt is a company  
**[0:26:19-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:26:19):**  called Boussoul in France, which is a network of socially minded bakeries along France,  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:26:27):**  started as a social project in the economic socialite solidare.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:26:32):**  So a clear social approach but with a business that makes sense and a whole approach which  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:26:41):**  is very, very interesting.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:26:42):**  So they're basically employing employees with difficulties in the market that are in risk  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:26:53):**  of being excluded from the labor market.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:26:55):**  And they're putting them to work in bakeries doing organic bread, selling directly to big  
**[0:27:03-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:03):**  customers.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:04):**  So with volume customers, canteens, schools, residences, etcetera, that are able to bring  
**[0:27:12-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:12):**  a certain volume.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:14):**  They have been quite successful in different cities in France and we've financed the opening  
**[0:27:23-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:23):**  of one of the network, the branches, and we're willing to do more because we see that the  
**[0:27:30-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:30):**  model is working and their approach can further be improved in terms of the transport, for  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:37):**  instance, to customers passing to electric cars, etcetera.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:43):**  These are all things that we're already looking at with them.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:47):**  The production process is very important too.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:48):**  The sourcing of the raw materials in the production, the use of plastics.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:27:57):**  There are several points, the management of waste too, very important.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:01):**  They're trying to minimize that.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:03):**  So there we see that we can very much have a holistic approach with them.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:10):**  I would say it's a very nice example to what we try to do, both in equity and debt, because  
**[0:28:16-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:16):**  this is of course an approach that we take with all companies in our portfolio.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:23):**  And what are you busy with right now?  
**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:27):**  We're talking February 2018.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:30):**  What's the main thing that's on your mind at this moment that you're busy with this  
**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:35):**  week and today as well?  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:37):**  So we are increasing our new retail programs and at the same time direct investment in  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:43):**  companies.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:44):**  So now we have for Q1, we are investing in five food companies and four are in Europe.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:53):**  One is on emerging countries.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:28:56):**  So these companies, we can really bring funds to the company, what I just explained before,  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:29:01):**  either directly or through our programs.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:29:06):**  So that's really how we can combine entrepreneurs' needs and what investors are looking for in  
**[0:29:14-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:29:14):**  terms of returns.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:29:16):**  We are really, I do think we are really a bridge, able to make these two worlds matching  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:29:25):**  and meeting and being both very happy of what they are doing.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:29:30):**  And what we explained in our last new retail report, it's another set value, performance,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:29:38):**  a chart or diversification in a portfolio cannot express all, I will not say the gratitude,  
**[0:29:46-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:29:46):**  but really the happiness of entrepreneurs when they can work with some people, supporting  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:29:54):**  them, understanding the business, trying to look at what is the second bounce of the ball,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:29:59):**  what is the business in five years, 10 years, how they will manage externalities and not  
**[0:30:04-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:30:04):**  being just a fund or a bank expecting an exit or waiting for the debt coming back.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:30:15):**  So I would say we are working on a kind of growth for Quadia, more deals, more investment,  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:30:22):**  but also without losing our priority, which is the quality of the business we are doing  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:30:29):**  and the quality of the funding we bring to companies.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:30:33):**  And is that something, because five years ago and especially 10 years ago when you first  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:30:38):**  started looking at this space, have you seen a lot of change in terms of the entrepreneurs?  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:30:43):**  I mean, you mentioned that there's a lot more focus on food, but do you see finally those  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:30:47):**  two worlds of agriculture and food and impact investing, are they coming closer?  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:30:52):**  Do you see any signs, not just in your daily work, but also outside that?  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:30:58):**  Yes, it's really big changes because 10 years ago or even five years ago, it was considered  
**[0:31:04-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:31:04):**  by investors or also by politics or by people on economics or just, I would say, leaders,  
**[0:31:15-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:31:15):**  it would be considered like you can do some philanthropy, you can be an utopist or a dreamer  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:31:22):**  on your side trying to do good food, good quality and good farming, but that's it.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:31:29):**  And the big money, the big investment is still maximizing the profit.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:31:33):**  And now I do think more and more people understand that we have to build the futures we need  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:31:41):**  and not just maximizing the profit.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:31:45):**  And it's just an example, but beginning of the year, having a letter from the CEO, Blackrock  
**[0:31:53-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:31:53):**  CEO, Larry Fink, explaining that the company must have a social role where governments  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:01):**  fail to really bring a better living conditions to a lot of people.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:06):**  I do think it's very strong.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:08):**  So as a summary, I would say 10 years ago, people didn't understand what I was doing  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:15):**  or they just thought that it was for being busy during the weekend.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:20):**  And now they can really understand it's a new economy we are building.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:24):**  And like internet 20 years ago, it was just a small part of the economy, but could be  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:29):**  growing and they want to be part of this economy.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:33):**  And what do you see as the main barriers?  
**[0:32:35-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:35):**  Because I see a lot of signs as well.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:36):**  I saw the announcement of Danone last week, where one of their main line of credits is  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:43):**  going to be the return they have to pay or the cost they have to pay on that is going  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:47):**  to be connected to their ESG performance.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:51):**  And that's not a small one because it's $2 billion.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:54):**  So they're starting even cost of capital is becoming less if you perform well on sustainability,  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:32:59):**  which is very interesting.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:00):**  But what are the main barriers that you think for?  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:03):**  Let's say there's a room full of impact investors who are very interested in food and agriculture  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:10):**  who have read the books about soil and about local communities, and they want to get into  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:15):**  this, but they don't know where to start.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:16):**  What do you feel as an expert in this space as a two main barriers for this?  
**[0:33:22-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:22):**  I think the two main barriers are first, you have to understand as a consumer, but also  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:30):**  as a distributor producer, that food is not a basic product.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:35):**  It's not like a smartphone or TV or anything.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:39):**  It's about life and it's about a cycle you need to protect or you need to regenerate.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:45):**  So it means it takes time.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:48):**  So I would say the two main barriers is understanding that the price and the cost is not everything,  
**[0:33:58-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:33:58):**  because we are talking about food and life.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:02):**  And the other barrier is being able to have a long term view.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:06):**  You cannot just look at one year cycle or six month cycle.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:10):**  But the good thing is not yet, but where you can really have a good perspective and being  
**[0:34:16-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:16):**  optimistic.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:17):**  It's even if it looks more expensive, you have a way to arrange the price for having  
**[0:34:23-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:23):**  quality food, not too expensive, just if you reduce your animal product consumption, for  
**[0:34:30-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:30):**  example.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:31):**  And the key for us is externalities.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:34):**  Once people would understand that someone has to pay for externalities, now you will  
**[0:34:40-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:40):**  not have any more barrier because it will be very logical that people doing well with  
**[0:34:47-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:47):**  less damage, so less externalities, they will compete better and they will have more autonomy  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:34:55):**  and residency on their value chain.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:00):**  So that's our bet for not having any more barrier.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:03):**  But now it's clear that long term view, the time you need to spend and the first cost,  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:12):**  it's the main issues for being mainstream.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:15):**  And where would you, both of you actually, if a new impact investor or new to the space,  
**[0:35:22-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:22):**  where would you start?  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:23):**  What would be your advice to get active in this space?  
**[0:35:27-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:27):**  Two ways.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:28):**  Either you want really to start, I would say, in emerging countries and you know, we cannot  
**[0:35:36-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:36):**  just be a happy consumer or happy investors because we are paying the fair trade.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:42):**  Fair trade is not enough.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:44):**  You really need to work on the value chain on these countries and to create jobs and  
**[0:35:49-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:49):**  to create autonomy to these countries.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:51):**  So could be a first approach.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:53):**  And the other approach is really about investing in the good companies in Europe, for example,  
**[0:35:59-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:35:59):**  doing the right product and just being sure that they can distribute the product and they  
**[0:36:06-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:36:06):**  have to educate the consumers that the price is not everything.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:36:12):**  So by having the right communications with all the scientific studies we know now about  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:36:22):**  very processed food or pesticide, you know, it's just a cycle.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:36:26):**  So you need to invest or you need to put your money where you will educate the consumer  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:36:32):**  for traceability, for example, and at the same time where you will be able to support  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:36:37):**  the producer for being sure they will keep going on doing the quality.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:36:41):**  And apparently it's what Danone is starting.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:36:44):**  I would add, we need to consume that product too and start from the beginning, which is  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:36:53):**  making sure that we understand the approach in terms of consumption and in terms of what  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:36:58):**  we want us as consumers to have.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:02):**  We see more products of that type.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:05):**  We of course are going to see more investment too coming in.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:08):**  And do you see, and this is really my final question.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:11):**  I always say that, but then I have five others.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:13):**  Do you see a role for us as consumers?  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:16):**  And in that case, most of us aren't accredited investors and are retail investors.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:20):**  Do you see a role for the consumers and in not just between brackets being the consumer  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:27):**  of the product, but also a more active role in the company?  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:29):**  You see a lot of crowdfunding, crowdfunding coming up.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:32):**  What's your medium to long term vision on that?  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:35):**  Of course, that is I think key.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:39):**  So if financing actors see that crowdfunding, inequity and in-depth crowd lending make sense  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:46):**  and is working, which we already see, this is a big push in terms of what the customer  
**[0:37:52-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:52):**  is looking for and what he's able and willing to finance from a micro perspective.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:37:59):**  But it's a fantastic way to start.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:03):**  That is only a clear sign that more money needs to be put in the space.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:09):**  And it's a starting point also for more institutional investors to look at the area and really make  
**[0:38:19-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:19):**  a difference with more capital and more scalability, which they of course bring.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:27):**  And would these royalty or indexed based loans?  
**[0:38:31-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:31):**  To me they seem perfect for crowd lending.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:33):**  But what do you think about that?  
**[0:38:35-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:35):**  Yes, they are totally in line with an approach that you would see in crowd lending.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:41):**  We know several examples that kind of go towards that direction.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:45):**  I think it has to be made understandable for retail investors, let's say.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:53):**  And it has to be simple.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:38:54):**  It has to be also it has to make sense for companies.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:39:00):**  They need to understand and feel that the mechanism works in terms of finding the right  
**[0:39:09-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:39:09):**  incentives, etc.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:39:11):**  The timing is very important.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:39:13):**  We need to be with and maturities at horizons that make sense and not every company has  
**[0:39:19-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:39:19):**  the same kind of horizon.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:39:22):**  So but that is clearly one approach that works for micro funding, let's say.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:39:30):**  And that is also the but it is also scalable as we've done it ourselves and you're able  
**[0:39:37-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:39:37):**  to start from small and come to a more critical size in the future.

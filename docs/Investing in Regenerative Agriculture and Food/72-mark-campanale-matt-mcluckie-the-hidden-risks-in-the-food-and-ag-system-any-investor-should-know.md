Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:00:14):**  This interview is about risk and hidden risks and why an agriculture economist after looking  at unburnable carbon and stranded assets in oil and gas is now looking at soil, wild fish,  fish farming and soil.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:00:29):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  planet mattered podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:00:42):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:55-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:00:55):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors big and small  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  In March last year we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:11-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:01:11):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:31-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:01:31):**  So welcome to another interview.  Today I'm joined by Matt, Matt Lucky, Head of Research and Mark Campanale, founder and  director of Planet Tracker.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:01:39):**  Planet Tracker's focus is on the global industry sectors defined by significant investment  flows and revenues in the context of planetary boundaries that are most threatened.  This includes regional and global industry sectors such as agribusiness, plastics and  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:01:51):**  textiles.  Welcome Matt and Mark.  Thank you.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:01:54):**  Thank you.  And to start with a personal question I always like to ask to both of you actually, what  led you into being part of Planet Tracker, finding Planet Tracker and working on these  
**[0:02:03-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:03):**  extremely large land use and also sea use actually industries.  So from my point of view, I trained as an agricultural economist about 30, 32, 33 years  ago and I did my master's thesis on environmental cost accounting techniques.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:19):**  It's quite, quite dry, but what I was trying to work out is if you factored in natural  capital into the way you did project evaluation as an investor, how would it return, how would  it change the return on investment and could you reduce the inputs like chemical inputs  
**[0:02:36-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:36):**  in favor of natural inputs by valuing nature better?  I never thought I'd find a way of using that degree, that master's degree, but I ended  up going into the city, into finance and what I realized is that financial markets are very  
**[0:02:50-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:50):**  sophisticated whether equity markets or debt markets, but they're not actually that good  at understanding planetary limits.  So there's no real pricing mechanism for air, for water quality, for even the land in which  
**[0:03:06-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:06):**  we depend for food production.  And so there's no real proper value of that.  So it struck me that we've got to work out the tools to think about this.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:17):**  And there's a lot of academic work around natural capital.  There's some fantastic work done by people like Sukhdev on natural capital and the UN  and others talk about it and economists talk about it, but it isn't really properly understood  
**[0:03:32-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:32):**  through the lens of financial markets.  So I set up Planet Tracker with my good friend, Nick Robbins, who's a professor of sustainable  finance at the London School of Economics.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:44):**  And Nick and I set it up really just to try and address this.  So what it means simply is that we look at, we try and look at all the fisheries and seafood  companies that are listed on stock exchanges around the world.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:57):**  And we try and look at say water businesses and forestry businesses and food and agricultural  production businesses.  And how do markets value those companies and do they incorporate planetary boundaries and  
**[0:04:11-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:11):**  do they understand the value of natural capital?  And what are the constraints in the future?  And what would this mean for business models?  
**[0:04:19-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:19):**  So that was the reason why I set up Planet Tracker.  And I was delighted that we've been supported by some terrific foundations that allowed  me to meet what are now great colleagues like Matt and Robin and the rest of the team that  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:33):**  form the heart of Planet Tracker.  Brilliant.  Thanks, Mark.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:38):**  So my story is somewhat different, a bit like Mark.  I started my career within the city, within finance, working for a large institutional  Swiss bank.  
**[0:04:51-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:51):**  And I realized that actually within that bank, they were launching a series of research pieces  around the new paradigm shift of where capital markets would be deploying large scale funding  in the future.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:08):**  And this was in around 2005.  And those themes really, they resonated with my personal feelings about the environment  and about the planet and looking at the sustainability of water, sustainability of agriculture systems,  
**[0:05:25-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:25):**  the sustainability of food systems and consumer trends.  And really whilst the research was extremely compelling, there was very little financial  product available in the marketplace to actually enable investors to support the sustainability  
**[0:05:42-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:42):**  trends or these mega trends.  And I actually spent 10 years managing conservation finance funds and setting up conservation  finance funds mainly in Africa and also in Europe.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:56):**  And through investing in businesses that were really at the forefront of driving sustainability  and specifically around landscapes, around biodiversity, we realized that these businesses  were facing some pretty simple barriers for scaling and that in order to actually generate  
**[0:06:17-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:06:17):**  the 300 billion or so dollars worth of conservation finance required to conserve the planet's  natural landscapes, we had to engage capital markets.  And so with that sort of view, I came back into the city to join Planet Tracker to really  
**[0:06:35-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:06:35):**  look at how we can leverage capital markets in terms of asset managers and asset owners.  So we're looking at pension funds, we're looking at large scale insurance based investors.  We're looking at the asset managers as custodians of their money and their investment decision  
**[0:06:56-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:06:56):**  making and looking at how they engage companies and can support companies to operate more  sustainably.  And so through that and through the lens of both equities and also fixed income, we are  
**[0:07:08-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:08):**  hoping to really shift the dial in how capital markets deploy their money, how capital markets  research and value risk and return and really start looking at generating significant amounts  of funding for the environment and for sustainability globally.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:26):**  It's extremely interesting.  Thank you for both of your introductions.  And as in the podcast, we mostly look at, I would say the positive side or the potential  
**[0:07:35-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:35):**  of agriculture and land use and sea use and the restoration of soils, etc.  But I think the risk side of things and the current degeneration of most of natural capital  is something we don't discuss often enough.  
**[0:07:49-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:49):**  So what is something that, I mean, you've been around for not very long, actually, I  think a year or two.  The first report was actually published about three years ago, two and a half years ago.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:02):**  And that was Fish Tracker.  So originally after I created Carbon Tracker, which is the climate focused and non-profit,  I began to start thinking about seafood.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:13):**  And the trigger was finding a Chinese seafood company listed on the London Stock Exchange,  which I thought was fascinating that we think the problems are located on the other side  of the world.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:25):**  And you don't have to look too far to discover actually from a financial point of view, they're  often based on our hometown.  So we did a piece of analysis to say how many seafood companies are there listed on the  
**[0:08:36-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:36):**  world stock markets.  And we found some 227, which came as a bit of a surprise to a lot of people because that's  actually quite a few companies involved in fisheries, catching wild fish, and so on.  
**[0:08:49-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:49):**  And so that was the first report.  And what we concluded was that there are far more boats out there trying to chase the fish  than there are fish and can be caught within a sustainable basis.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:04):**  And that equity capital markets were central to how these companies were being financed.  And so after the success of the launch of Fish Tracker, I decided we would absorb it  into Planet Tracker.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:17):**  And then Planet Tracker in turn would develop programs around textiles and water and food  and agriculture.  And so that's really the genesis of it.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:25):**  But I've got to say, we didn't really get going until Robin Millington and Matt McLuckie  here joined and allowed us to build the team.  And now we're motoring along at a good pace with a lot of ambition for what we can do,  
**[0:09:41-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:41):**  just because a lot of this research just hasn't been done.  The research report that we launched today on shrimps, there are 27 stock exchange listed  shrimp farming businesses that are owned by household name insurance companies and investors.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:00):**  People listening to your podcast today will probably have these companies in their pension  fund, typically.  And so we're the first- Without knowing, obviously.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:10):**  Yeah, no, they wouldn't know.  And doing this kind of analysis, I think the ESG sustainability industry is a huge industry  now employing thousands of people around the world.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:21):**  But there's still some new frontiers of unknown, undone research.  And I think this new shrimp paper is just an example of that.  Would you agree, Matt?  
**[0:10:30-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:30):**  No, I definitely agree.  And part of what we do is when we look at, for example, the global food supply chain  and actually the integrated value chains is that often capital markets aren't necessarily  
**[0:10:44-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:44):**  aware that they're exposed to some of these companies.  And there's a low degree of transparency through which these companies are operating in terms  of how they report to capital markets.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:55):**  And a company which actually offers a very good example, but also is a good example of  strong sustainability in terms of their reporting and actually what they're trying to do in  terms of moving the dial of how they report to capital markets is a group such as Mitsubishi.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:11:13):**  Mitsubishi is such a large global corporation and they produce a whole swathe of different  products from white goods to electric vehicles to renewable energy technology.  But they're also one of the largest fishing companies in the world and controlling a fleet  
**[0:11:29-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:11:29):**  of vessels as well as processing operators as well as distribution companies.  So I think it's important to actually just educate capital markets around actually what  companies in their portfolios are doing across the world when it comes to the environment  
**[0:11:46-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:11:46):**  and actually how they can work with managers of those companies to create more sustainable  management of resources.  And a very good example of that, I think, stems from some later work that we published  
**[0:12:01-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:12:01):**  at the back half of last year in Japan, where, excuse me, out of the 228 global listed fishing  companies, we know that approximately 41 of them are domiciled in Japan.  And what we've seen with Japan is that actually in terms of total fish production within their  
**[0:12:24-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:12:24):**  wildcatched seafood industry, production peaked in the mid 1980s.  So in 1985, Japan was producing around 12.5 million tons worth of seafood every year.  In 2017, that number had dropped to 3.3 million.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:12:40):**  So you're roughly, you're looking at a discount of over two thirds or decline in over two  thirds in terms of total production.  What we've also seen, however, though, is that if Japanese fisheries alone were managed  
**[0:12:53-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:12:53):**  more sustainably, it would generate an extra 5.5 billion dollars in terms of fishing revenue.  And so and if you extrapolate that number out on a global basis, the FAO have said that  if global fisheries were managed to achieve maximum sustainable yield, it would be worth  
**[0:13:09-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:09):**  an extra 51 billion dollars to global economies, so to the industry.  And so what we're actually finding is that there is a direct financial incentives for  portfolio managers to actually start engaging with companies within their portfolio to operate  
**[0:13:25-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:25):**  more sustainably because this represents it's not downside risk.  This is opportunity upside.  And that's an important feature that Planetracker likes to sort of that distinguishes us and  
**[0:13:37-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:37):**  that we are looking for the positive upside approach with these companies and the solutions  for the finance community to actually engage companies on.  Yeah, I think it's extremely interesting that you make that switch from risk to opportunity.  
**[0:13:50-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:50):**  And something you said before, Mark, and I was actually mad, like they're more, they're  more fishing vessels chasing than they are actually fish to catch at the moment as they're  not managed.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:01):**  Most of the fisheries are not managed sustainably.  That's something that I think not only is a huge risk, if you suddenly find out like,  look, if we have all these companies chasing the same fish, probably that's not going to  
**[0:14:12-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:12):**  work out.  But it's something very similar to think of the carbon tracker, sorry, which is obviously  a lot older, like there, there's more coal, or there's more CO2, or there's there's a  
**[0:14:21-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:21):**  lot of stuff we cannot burn.  And is that that's not a coincidence that that's the same, basically, that it is interesting  that nobody ever did that research, like, how much do we actually have?  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:31):**  How much is on the balance sheet?  And how much fish are we tracking or fishing?  Or how much carbon are we trying to burn?  
**[0:14:36-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:36):**  These are good points.  And we're still trying to some of this, which we're still trying to figure out.  I remember in the early 90s, when I first started thinking about this, I was looking  
**[0:14:46-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:46):**  at some stock exchange, forestry logging companies that were logging tropical forests in Asia.  And there was a particular company...  Let me get to the same.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:57):**  Yeah, well, I tell you what was happening was that the investors were valuing the company  on a price earnings multiple.  So they were saying that this year, they generated 10 million in revenue, say, for example, next  
**[0:15:09-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:09):**  year is 15 million, the following year is 20 million.  And they were valuing on a price earnings multiple, sort of giving the indication that  actually the best way to come up with a value of the company is to sort of say these cash  
**[0:15:21-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:21):**  flows are growing and it will continue to grow in the future.  So it's got to be a really valuable company.  Now what they didn't know, and this was where the interesting thing came in, is that the  
**[0:15:31-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:31):**  logging company was taking a quarter of the commercial trees out of the forest each year.  So after year four, there were no more commercial logs, the forest was trashed.  And so you couldn't use a PE price earnings multiple.  
**[0:15:45-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:45):**  So this analyst came out of the report and said, well, actually, this is all an illusion  of number work that you've got to evaluate on a sort of depletion play where you're sort  of saying, okay, each year you're removing 25% of the value each year.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:01):**  And at the end of year four, there are no more revenues.  So this analyst, I remember, she put this sell side note out with a new valuation that  essentially said, instead of the stock price being $20, it's going to be six.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:15):**  And pandemonium broke loose because the investors suddenly realized that after year four, this  particular business was going to have no more revenues from logging forest because they'd  logged out the forest.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:27):**  And it very neatly told a story that markets discount future cash flows, but they are unable  properly to price scarcity of natural resources.  And we use the wrong methodologies.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:39):**  So if you look at, say, seafood, investors assume, we hear this phrase, there's plenty  more fish in the sea.  Our grandmothers were using that phrase.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:48):**  Well, I'm afraid, folks, that's no longer true.  There aren't plenty more fish in the sea because we've been taking a lot of it out.  And investors have this strange assumption that you take one fish, there's going to be  
**[0:16:59-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:59):**  plenty more there next year.  And if you build one boat to catch fish, if you build 10 boats, you can catch 10 times  as much fish without realizing that you hit these boundaries.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:11):**  And really the heart of Planet Tracker and its research and its approach is really to  sort of say, well, look, we can't run the world thinking along these lines.  Markets have to change.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:22):**  Investment analytics have to change.  How we model risk has to change.  And ultimately, consumers and investors and the companies themselves have to rethink this.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:34):**  And we've got to stop this plundering of the oceans and plundering of the atmosphere.  And investors, normally quite conservative people.  And if we measured risk better and we put in place better practices, then a lot of this,  
**[0:17:48-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:48):**  the problem is not going to go away.  I think we would find better ways of dealing with the sustainability challenge.  I really like the switch to you.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:58):**  We are not modeling or we are as a species not modeling in scarcity.  And we sort of saw the forest.  Now hopefully that changed.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:04):**  But solar forest is an endless amount of trees and the sea is still the sea as an endless  amount of fish because we don't really see how many are actually down there.  Probably we get really, really scared.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:13):**  What you did to model, like how much of decline we actually already hit.  We just put more boats and more boats and more boats.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:21):**  Exactly.  And what we found in the meetings that we've done with different investment firms and we've  met with some large pension funds and we've met with a number of investment managers is  
**[0:18:32-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:32):**  a lot of people are getting this.  I think there has been a change in thinking in the last five, 10 years.  A lot more analysts, a lot more investors are getting it.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:42):**  I think it's true, particularly of Europe, particularly of the Scandinavian countries  and say the Netherlands.  I wouldn't say it was especially well known in Asia or perhaps North America, but it's  
**[0:18:57-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:57):**  growing awareness in Europe.  And the good thing about the internet and communications is we can begin to distribute  this research further afield and where we can, we try and publish in local languages  
**[0:19:09-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:09):**  to allow a pickup of the analysis.  And we see this educational thing is going to take some time, but we've got some things.  We've got some tools that work in our favor.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:20):**  So one of the things that does interest us is, is can we get stock exchanges to require  a better disclosures by listed companies?  So if you want to raise money to log a forest or to build boats to go fishing, do you properly  
**[0:19:36-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:36):**  disclose the sustainability profiles of the fisheries you operate in or the forest you  log in?  And can you present sustainable forestry management plans or resource management plans?  
**[0:19:48-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:48):**  And there's a role there for good regulation and good disclosure and a good accounting  systems.  And I also added to that, one of the key tools that we're seeing huge leaps and bounds in  
**[0:20:00-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:00):**  is the availability of high quality environmental data and the translation of that data into  metrics that capital markets can actually use.  And there's some incredible companies such as Planet Labs who are a satellite data provider  
**[0:20:16-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:16):**  who now we can start looking at soil profiling at a very granular level.  We can start looking at water at a very granular level and start determining how when you've  got agricultural companies that rely on soil productivity, when you've got brewery companies  
**[0:20:33-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:33):**  that rely on the availability of clean water, we can actually start modeling and pricing  in the short to medium term actually how the availability of that natural capital is trending  and start working with companies to ensure that they can maintain the sustainability  
**[0:20:52-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:52):**  of those resources.  And so I think capital markets are, they've got more tools at the disposable than they've  ever had to be able to look at valuations in a new way.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:05):**  I think where capital markets actually need to do maybe more work is the education of  analysts, the education of our portfolio managers and asset owners around how to use those tools  and fundamentally to look at the metrics.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:20):**  And these, we're talking about economic fundamental metrics and how does the environment  interrelate with those metrics?  So we've launched a paper, for example, looking at balance of payments, which is a key metric  
**[0:21:35-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:35):**  in determining sovereign credit risk.  And just looking at how the production of soft commodities in the country and those  that production relies on the availability of soil, of water, et cetera, how that actually  
**[0:21:49-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:49):**  impacts the production of commodities, which has a subsequent impact on balance of payments.  And so we can be looking at these linkages and actually starting to educate analysts  and working with analysts on how they can start pricing environmental externalities  
**[0:22:04-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:04):**  and natural capital values into their research.  Yeah, I actually want to do that.  It's a great bridge to the project you're doing in sovereign bonds.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:11):**  Can you unpack that a bit?  I would definitely link all the information below in the show notes, but can you unpack  a bit what it means in practice?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:19):**  You've looked mostly at Latin America, if I remember correctly, and really tried to  make the connection between the natural assets or natural capital that these countries have  and basically their expert focus sector on the agriculture and the risks there.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:32):**  But can you unpack a bit for people when that are not immediately thinking, oh, these are  sovereign bonds, how that works and what the research is that you've done there or the  project that you're doing, because it's a much longer one.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:42):**  Yeah, so very simply, we're working on a joint project with the Grantham Institute of the  London School of Economics to look at the connection between the environment's natural  capital and essentially sovereign bond risk.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:56):**  And primarily we're looking at credit defaults and interest rate risks and using funding  provided by the Gordon Betty Moore Foundation through the finance hub.  We focus our initial research on Brazil and Argentina.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:23:13):**  And let me just highlight the case of Argentina here.  Argentina as we know, macroeconomically, has had a rather tempestuous recent history.  And in 2018, that culminated in the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, actually issuing a  
**[0:23:30-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:23:30):**  $56 billion bailout standby agreements to the economy.  So in essence, if you factor in also sovereign bond investors into Argentina, and there's  been a huge impact on sovereign bond yields just through the economy over the past six  
**[0:23:49-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:23:49):**  months, Argentina effectively owes a considerable amount of US dollars both to the IMF, but  also to sovereign bond investors.  Now when we look at what generates essentially net income for the economy of Argentina, 70%  
**[0:24:07-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:07):**  of Argentina's exports rely on natural capital in their production.  It's very much-  70, right?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:14):**  70.  70.  So, and if we look across the G20, so Brazil, Argentina, and Indonesia are the top three  
**[0:24:21-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:21):**  countries that rely on natural capital export, based exports to generate economic growth.  And so with the case of Argentina, it's very much an agricultural-based economy, and two  of the main agricultural products are soybeans and livestock.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:39):**  And what we've seen is that actually there's been a huge amount of deforestation of the  Serrado and of forest there is to create landscapes for the production of soy and the production  of livestock.  
**[0:24:51-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:51):**  And the soy is very important for the economy because it gets exported in not only raw form,  but also gets processed into, for example, biodiesel.  And 60% of Europe's biodiesel is actually originated from Argentina for looking at soy-based  
**[0:25:07-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:07):**  biodiesel.  And so what we've seen with Argentina is that they've got this big US dollar deficit or  liability sitting on the national balance sheet.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:18):**  They've got a low US dollar level of treasury reserves.  And so therefore, they rely on generating positive US dollar-based balance of payments  to actually service those liabilities.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:29):**  Now, if we go to the drought which Argentina had in 2018, we know that those droughts had  a significant impact on the production of soybeans.  And if you look at actually the costs of that, which has been cited by credit rating agencies,  
**[0:25:45-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:45):**  is that generally they account for about $14 billion worth of lost balance of payments  receipts coming into the economy.  Now, Argentina defaulted on an $8 billion payments to the IMF resulting in or triggering  
**[0:26:00-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:00):**  another release of standby agreement funding.  So if that drought hadn't taken place or if the sector had been more resilient, then actually  you could argue that that standby agreement trigger would not have taken place.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:16):**  During a field trip to go to one of the main production sites in Argentina in Rosario,  a number of the local farmers were commenting on two fronts.  One, the impact of the drought, but two, the impact of soils because they've got decreasing  
**[0:26:31-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:31):**  soil productivity, which actually impacts their short to medium term ability to maintain  the consistent rate of yield, so production yield off their land.  Add into that a prohibitive tax regime and actually the whole sector and the whole economy  
**[0:26:47-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:47):**  is going to suffer and that needs to be priced in to the forward sovereign bond outlook by  analysts.  And we didn't find or we hardly found any analysts who actually looking at this in their  
**[0:27:00-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:00):**  valuations of sovereign bond yields and sovereign bond default risk for the economy.  And so these are the types of, I think, quite simple linkages that we want to be able to  make and present capital markets.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:13):**  So basically the link between Argentina owes a lot of dollars because of history and because  of the last years and needs a lot of dollars and basically gets that mainly through agriculture  outputs and agriculture export.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:26):**  And at the same time, this agriculture sector is really, really suffering because of climate  change, because of non-regenerative methods.  So it's sort of a, I wouldn't say a perfect storm, but it's definitely a huge risk if  
**[0:27:38-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:38):**  you are exposed to the sovereign bonds and you're saying that this risk is not priced  into the price of the sovereign bonds.  And you're seeing these type of risks basically, I mean, that's been the last 15 years probably  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:50):**  of your life Mark to finding these risks not being priced in is like a continuum.  Sure.  Yeah, no, sure.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:57):**  I mean, if you're an analyst trying to come up with a methodology or a framework to think  about how to incorporate these types of the risks that Matt's been describing so well,  or scarcity risks is quite complex.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:28:13):**  And if there are people who work in the accountancy profession that are listening in, there is  a biological accounting definitions, which are used by companies, which were involved  in say forestry or agriculture.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:28:30):**  So accountants know that when something grows, it increases the value of the asset.  And so you have a biological accounting framework for valuing that.  And so in the case of farmed fish, you can actually use these biological accounting techniques  
**[0:28:49-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:28:49):**  to come up and count how many fish there are and what they're worth.  But when you, when it comes to the open seas, all that accounting understanding is thrown  out the window and no biological accounting actually applies to natural capital because  
**[0:29:06-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:06):**  of the open seas.  There's no way of defining what is yours and how you find it and how you account for it.  And so data issues, accounting issues are complex.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:18):**  And the only way to solve this problem is to literally put a label on every single fish  in the sea, and then you can work out who owns it, which of course is impossible in  practice.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:27):**  But you can see some of the challenges that we have in really properly addressing from  an accounting point of view, from a financial point of view, how can you put a value on  something which you don't know who owns it, you don't know where it's located, you don't  
**[0:29:41-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:41):**  know how it's going to be used, you don't know how it's going to be replaced.  These are big complex issues.  And we're just really at the beginning, I think, of the journey of trying to understand  
**[0:29:51-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:51):**  how any of us who are involved in finance can put our arms around such a huge challenge  because if we don't, you know, more people talk jokingly, well, with some seriousness,  that water will be where the new wars will start from.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:07):**  And because we haven't properly accounted for it.  And there's battles between communities versus corporations for scarce assets of which water  is a classic example.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:16):**  And does that generate, because you mentioned you've seen in the last year or so, quite  a few analysts, especially in Europe, and quite a few, let's say, financial institutions  that are starting to get this, does this mean that slowly, we're getting to a place where  
**[0:30:33-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:33):**  the opportunities are becoming more interesting, like the one you mentioned in Japan, like  actually, they would manage their fisheries sustainably, the potential is a lot bigger.  Do you see more and more people looking at like this business case for regenerating a  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:45):**  natural capital?  Is that is that something you see already?  Or is that something you would like to see, obviously?  
**[0:30:51-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:51):**  And what is the what do you see there, but to both of you, actually,  We're definitely seeing opportunities around regenerative natural capital in terms of businesses  and looking at the positive impact that that has on investors.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:04):**  And I think to use another illustration from some of our aquaculture researchers, at the  end of last year, we launched a salmon briefing paper looking at the global salmon industry  and specifically listed companies operating in the industry.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:22):**  And we took the top 10 listed salmon producers by revenue globally.  And we looked at we did a backdated analysis over the past five years.  And we said, if you took their forecast production rates at the start of the year versus their  
**[0:31:38-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:38):**  actual production rate at the end of the year, what was what was the difference?  And we found a decrease of actually it was between six to eight percent in achieved versus  forecast production.  
**[0:31:52-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:52):**  And we then started to look at some of the reasons behind that.  And generally, the vast majority of reasons were were natural in the sense of it was increased  water temperature, increased instances of parasites such as seed lice, increased instances  
**[0:32:09-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:09):**  of algal blooms, which can be caused by, for example, agricultural runoff of fertilizers  and pesticides.  And so what we're seeing is that actually the the the area of suitable environments  
**[0:32:24-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:24):**  for coastal salmon farming globally is shrinking at the same time the number of farms is growing.  And so what we're seeing are huge advancements in the development of different types of technology,  both for for inland aquaculture, which will have a huge bearing if it can be achieved  
**[0:32:42-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:42):**  at a cost competitive rate in terms of providing protein, especially in developed markets,  but also actually deep sea or high sea aquaculture.  Now, what the capital markets need to recognize is that there is a big growth opportunity  
**[0:32:56-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:56):**  there, but the pricing and the financing of of these of these opportunities needs to change  because our current salmon prices offshore aquaculture is completely unviable commercially,  as is inland aquaculture.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:12):**  So fundamentally, prices will need to increase.  And so this then means that companies have to be able to generate more margin, but it  can't be growth at all costs.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:23):**  We need to be looking at actually increasing the fundamental price of these commodities  to ensure that companies are motivated and incentivized to operate more sustainably.  And at the moment, history tells us that operating more sustainably can cost more money.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:39):**  But actually, in the medium to long term, those costs are recovered very quickly.  And ultimately, you end up with a more robust, more sustainable, more profitable business.  So so I think we are seeing really interesting opportunities available in different sectors.  
**[0:33:53-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:53):**  That's great to hear.  I think a lot of people on the call would either argue that they are working on that,  maybe not yet to the level of a publicly listed company, but hopefully in a few years.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:05):**  And let's say the investors on the call would probably be interested to see how to put money  to work there.  So I want to be conscious of your time and ask a few final questions.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:13):**  And one is actually to both of you.  If you could wave a magic wand and tomorrow morning we wake up and either you, Mark, or  you Matt have changed something in if you've changed one thing in the agriculture industry  
**[0:34:25-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:25):**  from a sustainability point of view, what would that be?  Let's say the land use industry, let's take it a bit broader and just act.  What would you both change overnight if you had the power?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:35):**  Oh, that's such an easy question.  Come on, Matt, you can do that one first.  My number one issue is I believe soil.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:43):**  And how do we build agricultural and livestock systems that manage to maintain the integrity  of soil?  Because soil provides the platform for all agricultural growth.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:58):**  And there's some excellent groups such as Soil Capital based in London who are doing  amazing work around looking at different forms of regenerative agriculture and looking at  soil health.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:09):**  And soil health is fundamental to feeding the planet.  So in the agriculture space, that one's quite straightforward for me.  And what about you, Mark?  
**[0:35:18-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:18):**  Yeah, I'm going to take a different angle.  I do think it's possible that not that market mechanisms panacea and solve all the problems,  they don't.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:30):**  But I do think that we could build the case.  But similar to the task force on climate related financial disclosures that were set up, that  financial regulators, I'm thinking particularly stock exchange regulators and regulators governing  
**[0:35:43-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:43):**  the issuance of bonds and equities, can encourage any company involved in managing natural capital  to submit proper, full and complete natural capital models, analysis, resource management  plans, impact assessments, as part of a prospectus before investors invest.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:36:08):**  So you can't just say, oh, we're raising some money to log this forest until you genuinely  put what the resource management plan is.  I don't like logging forests at all, or even open seas fishery to the extent that it's  
**[0:36:22-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:36:22):**  as damaging as it is.  I think that regulators could say, look, if you're going to do this, you've got to give  a proper account for how you will leave the environment, the open seas, land in the same  
**[0:36:35-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:36:35):**  condition as you found it without depleting natural capital, without spoiling what nature  has given us.  And you've got to set out how you do that.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:36:44):**  And I think that there's a very strong rationale for that which regulators would understand  and investors ultimately would understand.  It's only part of the way to answering the challenges we face.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:36:55):**  I think it's an important step.  I completely agree.  And I want to thank you both so much for your time this morning.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:37:02):**  And I'll definitely be checking in, sharing the reports that are already out there.  And when new ones come out, we'll be sharing that with the community.  Thank you very much.

Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:38:30-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:38:30):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course after 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the  question how to put money to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:38:43):**  2011.  And recording these podcasts since 2016.  We thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:38:49):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:38:56):**  How have we picked interviewees?  And what questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:39:02):**  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  
**[0:39:06-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:39:06):**  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course you, the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders,  people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders,  
**[0:39:18-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:39:18):**  crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture,  key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc, etc.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:39:31-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:39:31):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  etc.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:39:42):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:39:46):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:39:56):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:40:05):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:40:14):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:40:29-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:40:29):**  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:40:40):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:40:47):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:40:55):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

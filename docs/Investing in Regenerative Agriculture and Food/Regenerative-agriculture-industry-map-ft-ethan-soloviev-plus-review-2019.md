**[0:00:06-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:00:06):**  where we're going to be looking at 2019 and 2020. Welcome back Ethan. Great to see  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:00:13):**  you Kun, looking forward to this review. So we're going to be in a minute we're  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:00:17):**  going to be looking at 2019, what happened and what we're looking forward  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:00:21):**  to in 2020 but as everybody can see as we're sharing a screen we have something  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:00:26):**  or you have something very exciting to to share with us. Can you walk us through  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:00:30):**  the Regenerative Agriculture Industry Map 1.0? All right so this is something  
**[0:00:36-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:00:36):**  I've been working on for the last nine months, gathering all of the different  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:00:43):**  organizations I think I've got 159 that are working in the regenerative  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:00:49):**  agriculture industry. Wow. And I decided to do this in order to basically help  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:00:55):**  me see everything and then also I realized wow it would be great for the  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:00:59):**  whole community to be able to see itself and so I just started collecting these  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:01:04):**  putting in the spreadsheet getting bits of data and then I got kind of stuck  
**[0:01:09-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:01:09):**  because I thought who am I to judge what is and isn't regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:01:16):**  right we've talked about this a lot. The light version, the heavy version, the dark  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:01:20):**  green version. Yeah exactly and so I thought I thought you know if I put  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:01:25):**  something out there where it's just me judging who is and isn't regenerative  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:01:29):**  it's gonna be rather controversial and so I decided to take a slightly  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:01:35):**  different tack to figure out who would be on this map and I took a simple  
**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:01:41):**  objective criteria I said who is using the term regenerative agriculture in  
**[0:01:48-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:01:48):**  their public facing communications and maybe that's overly simplistic and it  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:01:54):**  definitely allows some entities onto this map that I don't agree with how  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:01:59):**  they use regenerative agriculture I don't think they're actually doing  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:03):**  regenerative agriculture but at least this is objective and clear and it's if  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:08):**  you are using it in some form of public communication and I was able to find it  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:13):**  then I put it on here and I also put in the first year I could find both from my  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:19):**  tracking over the last decade but the first year I could find that you used  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:22):**  that term. Which makes it so interesting it's not just a static map it actually  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:27):**  shows the movement or the development better but the development of the  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:32):**  sector over the years and we're definitely gonna link below in I'm  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:37):**  pointing below but below in the show notes a link to the article you wrote on  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:41):**  this and on the methodology and and why you did certain things which I think is  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:45):**  I had a chance to read the draft version extremely interesting and I think a lot  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:48):**  of people would really enjoy diving deeper into it but now I think without  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:52):**  further ado we would love to see the map. Okay one last thing so the map will  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:57):**  sort of go from one side to the other of years like how long has an entity been  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:01):**  using the term regenerative agriculture and then there's also a vertical axis  
**[0:03:07-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:07):**  which is just a really rough sense of financial scale so is this a small  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:14):**  entity that's doing you know less than a million a year is it kind of mid-sized  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:17):**  that's between a million and a hundred million or is it one of the larger  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:20):**  organizations that's really working at a financial scale of a hundred million or  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:24):**  more those are somewhat arbitrary divisions and you know there's not  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:28):**  specific detail for each of them I just wanted to get a sense of how things have  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:32):**  been developing over time and I think there'll be more detail to that in the  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:37):**  future and all of this was from what I could find publicly and through personal  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:41):**  communications on some of the organizations. So here goes, that's the  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:47):**  wrong one here is the regenerative agriculture industry map so as we were  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:54):**  discussing it starts yeah starts starts back at 2005 and you can see going  
**[0:03:59-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:59):**  through time all the way up to 2019 you can see these different oops you can see  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:08):**  the different financial scale from greater than a hundred million to  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:11):**  between one to a hundred to less than a million and then to an undisclosed so  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:16):**  there's a large number that undisclosed and then the different colors are these  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:19):**  five different entity types that I selected sort of categorized those that  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:25):**  are working on the investment side those that are actual farms those are service  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:28):**  organizations so there's a this is a big clump of consultants and educators and  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:33):**  media organizations and basically anything that doesn't fit anywhere else  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:36):**  basically everything that yeah that doesn't fit in the other category and  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:39):**  then there's CPG you know or retailers there's I think just one retailer on  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:43):**  here but CPG or retailer and then in the nonprofit sector and I guess I should  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:47):**  say that nonprofit and service organization overlaps significantly in  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:51):**  the actual functions just ones for profit ones not for profit and what's

**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:05:26):**  up all of a sudden there are some organizations that have been working

**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:06:43):**  of nonprofit community really started to seed a lot more you can see the green  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:06:48):**  the sort of CPG space started picking up around that time but then grew  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:06:52):**  significantly to the point where you know 2016 2017 2018 there's more and  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:06:59):**  more and more of these CPG you know consumer packaged goods players and the  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:07:05):**  scale financially increased significantly so you know lush was a  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:07:11):**  really early adopter back in 2013 2014 of regenerative agriculture but then  
**[0:07:17-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:07:17):**  really 2016 onward you saw Danone General Mills you know guy caring  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:07:24):**  Fisher right this sort of financial sorry the the fashion and clothing  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:07:29):**  industry coming online so there's this real movement into the broader CPG space  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:07:34):**  that has been in turn I think driven a lot of the excitement we're seeing out  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:07:40):**  in the world in the consumer eye and and so what what does the community people  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:07:47):**  listening to to this podcast or looking at it what shall we do should we  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:07:52):**  comment should we get involved what's your what's your angle with this well  
**[0:07:57-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:07:57):**  first just enjoy and see yeah see your organization that's on there or maybe

**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:08:15):**  could you looked at it and said oh I'm seeing some new things on there that I

**[0:08:22-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:08:22):**  if your organization is not on here I'm I apologize and just send me a note and

**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:08:39):**  year you used it and I'll you know shift it this is a draft this is for community  
**[0:08:44-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:08:44):**  development and yeah just contribute I think there's a number of different ways  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:08:52):**  that I want to move this forward which I can talk about in a minute and this  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:08:55):**  will be outlined in the the medium post where I share the methodology and  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:00):**  everything I'm saying here as well but there's there's there's new directions  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:06):**  we can go now that we have this relatively objective look at things that  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:12):**  also give some information there's sort of there's more we can do in the future  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:15):**  with this I think it's extremely exciting I think got a number of  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:20):**  conversations over the last month of people said we need we need a map maybe  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:24):**  some people are saying we need a map on just farms we need a map on investments  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:27):**  we need a map but probably actually we need an overview overview map of trying  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:32):**  to at least capture most of the whole space and see since when people are or  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:37):**  these organizations are actually talking about it doing obviously is a different  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:40):**  thing but publicly mentioning I think it was a there was been a big breakthrough  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:44):**  in the methodology to get this together yeah because you know what it really  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:50):**  even though it seems sort of simple what I realized is it actually takes  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:54):**  especially for these larger organizations for them to put regenerative agriculture  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:00):**  in public facing communication it means that they did think about it it means  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:04):**  that they looked at the definitions that were out there it means that they looked  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:08):**  at the community and they still even up to the highest levels of the  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:11):**  organization had to get approval to use this term and put it forward as something  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:16):**  important so it became clear to me once I started to make that shift that it is  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:20):**  non-trivial to use the term and that it does actually mean something that yeah  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:26):**  absolutely not not to give too many teasers for the for the podcast but I  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:30):**  will record a small episode with a very large very traditional wealth manager  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:36):**  managing I think over 1.2 or 1.3 trillion and they are starting to use  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:42):**  soil health as actually when they engage with public publicly traded companies  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:46):**  and they're probably the first to do that and they see now that others are  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:50):**  internally and discussing with them like how did you do that etc publicly not  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:54):**  saying it yet so you see that that publicly mentioning especially in large  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:57):**  organizations is a is a huge hurdle that they need to take and once they've done  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:02):**  it obviously we can we can hold them accountable which is great there's a  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:07):**  couple of the things I just want to note about the work here we are a very tight  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:11):**  schedule I know I know so you can see this is a great little graph that just  
**[0:11:17-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:17):**  shows the number of entities that have started to use the term in green and  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:20):**  then the cumulative total over time and so I just want to point out the standard  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:25):**  the exponential growth curve I see in index yeah we got a little hockey stick  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:29):**  except this very interesting thing which is in this year in 2019 was like a  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:35):**  significant drop in new entities using it so I'm very curious about why that is  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:41):**  and I have some theories that I'll save for another time but I just wanted to  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:45):**  kind of point that out as a whole that there's a there's an interesting thing  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:49):**  that's happened this year and I'm curious other people's thoughts on sort  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:54):**  of why that is that there's there's less new organizations and you know if you  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:58):**  look back at that initial one there's less of the larger you know mid and  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:12:03):**  larger scale organizations coming in this year so I think that's interesting  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:12:07):**  the other thing that I want to point out is shortcoming it's a nice entity type  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:12:13):**  split actually if you look at it yeah except there's a shortcoming the farm  
**[0:12:20-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:12:20):**  you mentioned area is underrepresented I had a hard time capturing and you know  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:12:28):**  finding all of the very very very large number of farms that are now starting to  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:12:34):**  say hey we use regenerative agriculture partially because a lot of farms don't  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:12:37):**  have a website where they're posting that they're using regenerative  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:12:40):**  agriculture and it's just growing so quickly especially in Australia in the  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:12:45):**  Midwest the United States there's a lot of farms starting to use this term so  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:12:49):**  we need to reach out if we're a farmer if you know a farmer a farm a group of  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:12:56):**  farms that is using regenerative agriculture publicly make sure Ethan  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:13:00):**  knows about it so we can get this 21 up yeah and I really I want to exactly I  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:13:05):**  want to build it out I think there's probably a hundred two hundred maybe  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:13:08):**  even 300 farms explicitly using the term and I really want to grow that in

**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:15:42):**  definitely a highlight and a few others were some media things actually Zach  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:15:46):**  Bush with the whole glyphosate discussion had a breakthrough and

**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:15:54):**  where they discussed regenerative agriculture savory and holistic  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:15:58):**  management from the food and medicine side of things very interesting very  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:16:01):**  short piece but so it seems like together with the biggest little farm  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:16:05):**  that came out and it's actually here as well and it seems like also on the media  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:16:09):**  side on the consumer side and on outside our little bubble this this whole idea  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:16:14):**  of soil region egg region food food as medicine is starting to to really catch

**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:16:24):**  what are you looking forward to next year I think what I'm most excited about  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:16:30):**  is the intersection between regenerative agriculture which we both follow and  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:16:36):**  love but that intersection with regenerative business the rise of not  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:16:43):**  just doing regenerative agriculture in the supply system you know helping

**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:16:52):**  about a business and doing that in a regenerative way that's been growing  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:16:56):**  this year with the regenerative business summit with interest from many different  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:01):**  organizations so I think as regeneration as a paradigm starts to get into  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:06):**  business and investing that is an important thing that I think is going  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:12):**  to happen and have a larger stage in 2020 what about you very exciting yeah  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:16):**  I'm looking forward to keeping it very close to home a transition finance  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:21):**  series that we have been planning for a long time actually very much focused on  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:25):**  farmers so farmers that have done the pilots have read the books went to the  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:31):**  courses done the let's say landscape scale a redesign of their farm but they  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:37):**  are on very thin margins so they're missing appropriate transition finance to  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:41):**  speed up their transition and we're are actually recording at the moment the  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:46):**  first episodes where we take a farm in Germany and a farmer will be my co-host  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:51):**  Benedict Beuzel where we're gonna basically take his case which is a  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:55):**  thousand hectares relatively large especially in Europe and go to a number  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:59):**  of practitioners that are in the space of financing in regenerative agriculture  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:18:05):**  and food and say okay this is the case how would you finance this and how would  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:18:08):**  you finance it in a way that makes sense for soil investor and obviously farmer  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:18:12):**  so it's gonna be a very practical learning journey which we're gonna share  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:18:16):**  through the podcast and I'm very much looking forward to to that learning

**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:18:24):**  Benedict but obviously a lot of principles which should apply to many

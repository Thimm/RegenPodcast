### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2019-00-23)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to another Regeneration Newsroom end of year review with Ethan and myself  where we're going to be looking at 2019 and 2020. Welcome back Ethan. Great to see  you Kun, looking forward to this review. So we're going to be in a minute we're  going to be looking at 2019, what happened and what we're looking forward  to in 2020 but as everybody can see as we're sharing a screen we have something  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:00:26):**  or you have something very exciting to to share with us. Can you walk us through  the Regenerative Agriculture Industry Map 1.0? All right so this is something  I've been working on for the last nine months, gathering all of the different  organizations I think I've got 159 that are working in the regenerative  agriculture industry. Wow. And I decided to do this in order to basically help  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:00:55):**  me see everything and then also I realized wow it would be great for the  whole community to be able to see itself and so I just started collecting these  putting in the spreadsheet getting bits of data and then I got kind of stuck  because I thought who am I to judge what is and isn't regenerative agriculture  right we've talked about this a lot. The light version, the heavy version, the dark  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:01:20):**  green version. Yeah exactly and so I thought I thought you know if I put  something out there where it's just me judging who is and isn't regenerative  it's gonna be rather controversial and so I decided to take a slightly  different tack to figure out who would be on this map and I took a simple  objective criteria I said who is using the term regenerative agriculture in  
**[0:01:48-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:01:48):**  their public facing communications and maybe that's overly simplistic and it  definitely allows some entities onto this map that I don't agree with how  they use regenerative agriculture I don't think they're actually doing  regenerative agriculture but at least this is objective and clear and it's if  you are using it in some form of public communication and I was able to find it  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:13):**  then I put it on here and I also put in the first year I could find both from my  tracking over the last decade but the first year I could find that you used  that term. Which makes it so interesting it's not just a static map it actually  shows the movement or the development better but the development of the  sector over the years and we're definitely gonna link below in I'm  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:37):**  pointing below but below in the show notes a link to the article you wrote on  this and on the methodology and and why you did certain things which I think is  I had a chance to read the draft version extremely interesting and I think a lot  of people would really enjoy diving deeper into it but now I think without  further ado we would love to see the map. Okay one last thing so the map will  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:02:57):**  sort of go from one side to the other of years like how long has an entity been  using the term regenerative agriculture and then there's also a vertical axis  which is just a really rough sense of financial scale so is this a small  entity that's doing you know less than a million a year is it kind of mid-sized  that's between a million and a hundred million or is it one of the larger  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:20):**  organizations that's really working at a financial scale of a hundred million or  more those are somewhat arbitrary divisions and you know there's not  specific detail for each of them I just wanted to get a sense of how things have  been developing over time and I think there'll be more detail to that in the  future and all of this was from what I could find publicly and through personal  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:03:41):**  communications on some of the organizations. So here goes, that's the  wrong one here is the regenerative agriculture industry map so as we were  discussing it starts yeah starts starts back at 2005 and you can see going  through time all the way up to 2019 you can see these different oops you can see  the different financial scale from greater than a hundred million to  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:11):**  between one to a hundred to less than a million and then to an undisclosed so  there's a large number that undisclosed and then the different colors are these  five different entity types that I selected sort of categorized those that  are working on the investment side those that are actual farms those are service  organizations so there's a this is a big clump of consultants and educators and  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:33):**  media organizations and basically anything that doesn't fit anywhere else  basically everything that yeah that doesn't fit in the other category and  then there's CPG you know or retailers there's I think just one retailer on  here but CPG or retailer and then in the nonprofit sector and I guess I should  say that nonprofit and service organization overlaps significantly in  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:04:51):**  the actual functions just ones for profit ones not for profit and what's  your goal with this what do you I mean apart from doing a huge gift to I think  the sector and anybody that wants to learn more and see who they should reach  out to try to intern try to work with try to invest in etc but what's your  what's your goal with this well one thing I was thinking is that there's a  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:05:15):**  huge buzz and hype about regenerative agriculture right now and I wanted to  give some sense of where it's come from it's not just a quick thing that popped  up all of a sudden there are some organizations that have been working  with the term all the way for more than you know almost 15 years now and there's  a little yeah there's a little note an interesting here thing that I'll say  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:05:38):**  about the Rodale Institute because they had a much earlier usage as well as a  couple other people back in the 1980s but mostly it was silent until you know  regarians from the permaculture community guy University Terra Genesis a  company that I founded started using it the carbon farming course we did in you  know 2009 we did workshops in regenerative agriculture 2009 Joel  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:06:04):**  Saladin that poly face these are some of the earliest earliest usages that I was  able to track and then there was sort of a slew it was interesting to see that  the uptake there was really this uptake from the investment community biological  capital on Monia LLC really picked up this idea of regeneration quite early  back in you know 2011 and then there was a slew of other investment  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:06:29):**  organizations that came on early along with a group of not-for-profits  especially holistic management savory Institute kiss the ground and and that I  think that sort of combination of the investment community then this big chunk  of nonprofit community really started to seed a lot more you can see the green  the sort of CPG space started picking up around that time but then grew  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:06:52):**  significantly to the point where you know 2016 2017 2018 there's more and  more and more of these CPG you know consumer packaged goods players and the  scale financially increased significantly so you know lush was a  really early adopter back in 2013 2014 of regenerative agriculture but then  really 2016 onward you saw Danone General Mills you know guy caring  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:07:24):**  Fisher right this sort of financial sorry the the fashion and clothing  industry coming online so there's this real movement into the broader CPG space  that has been in turn I think driven a lot of the excitement we're seeing out  in the world in the consumer eye and and so what what does the community people  listening to to this podcast or looking at it what shall we do should we  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:07:52):**  comment should we get involved what's your what's your angle with this well  first just enjoy and see yeah see your organization that's on there or maybe  not on there I should definitely say this is version 1.0 it's a draft there  are likely mistakes I'm sure there are groups that I left off of here although  could you looked at it and said oh I'm seeing some new things on there that I  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:08:18):**  didn't know about which I think is a good sign definitely new names yeah yeah  if your organization is not on here I'm I apologize and just send me a note and  we'll get it into the next version if I've gotten the year that you first used  it wrong I apologize you know please send some documentation of the earliest  year you used it and I'll you know shift it this is a draft this is for community  
**[0:08:44-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:08:44):**  development and yeah just contribute I think there's a number of different ways  that I want to move this forward which I can talk about in a minute and this  will be outlined in the the medium post where I share the methodology and  everything I'm saying here as well but there's there's there's new directions  we can go now that we have this relatively objective look at things that  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:12):**  also give some information there's sort of there's more we can do in the future  with this I think it's extremely exciting I think got a number of  conversations over the last month of people said we need we need a map maybe  some people are saying we need a map on just farms we need a map on investments  we need a map but probably actually we need an overview overview map of trying  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:32):**  to at least capture most of the whole space and see since when people are or  these organizations are actually talking about it doing obviously is a different  thing but publicly mentioning I think it was a there was been a big breakthrough  in the methodology to get this together yeah because you know what it really  even though it seems sort of simple what I realized is it actually takes  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:09:54):**  especially for these larger organizations for them to put regenerative agriculture  in public facing communication it means that they did think about it it means  that they looked at the definitions that were out there it means that they looked  at the community and they still even up to the highest levels of the  organization had to get approval to use this term and put it forward as something  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:16):**  important so it became clear to me once I started to make that shift that it is  non-trivial to use the term and that it does actually mean something that yeah  absolutely not not to give too many teasers for the for the podcast but I  will record a small episode with a very large very traditional wealth manager  managing I think over 1.2 or 1.3 trillion and they are starting to use  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:10:42):**  soil health as actually when they engage with public publicly traded companies  and they're probably the first to do that and they see now that others are  internally and discussing with them like how did you do that etc publicly not  saying it yet so you see that that publicly mentioning especially in large  organizations is a is a huge hurdle that they need to take and once they've done  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:02):**  it obviously we can we can hold them accountable which is great there's a  couple of the things I just want to note about the work here we are a very tight  schedule I know I know so you can see this is a great little graph that just  shows the number of entities that have started to use the term in green and  then the cumulative total over time and so I just want to point out the standard  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:25):**  the exponential growth curve I see in index yeah we got a little hockey stick  except this very interesting thing which is in this year in 2019 was like a  significant drop in new entities using it so I'm very curious about why that is  and I have some theories that I'll save for another time but I just wanted to  kind of point that out as a whole that there's a there's an interesting thing  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:11:49):**  that's happened this year and I'm curious other people's thoughts on sort  of why that is that there's there's less new organizations and you know if you  look back at that initial one there's less of the larger you know mid and  larger scale organizations coming in this year so I think that's interesting  the other thing that I want to point out is shortcoming it's a nice entity type  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:12:13):**  split actually if you look at it yeah except there's a shortcoming the farm  you mentioned area is underrepresented I had a hard time capturing and you know  finding all of the very very very large number of farms that are now starting to  say hey we use regenerative agriculture partially because a lot of farms don't  have a website where they're posting that they're using regenerative  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:12:40):**  agriculture and it's just growing so quickly especially in Australia in the  Midwest the United States there's a lot of farms starting to use this term so  we need to reach out if we're a farmer if you know a farmer a farm a group of  farms that is using regenerative agriculture publicly make sure Ethan  knows about it so we can get this 21 up yeah and I really I want to exactly I  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:13:05):**  want to build it out I think there's probably a hundred two hundred maybe  even 300 farms explicitly using the term and I really want to grow that in  upcoming versions great absolutely amazing I am switching gears to the  looking forward and looking backward of 2019 and 2020 I think I'm looking  forward to how this develops in 2020 but if you had to pick one thing of 2019 if  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:13:28):**  we look at this year which has been extremely busy I mean you could see it  in the in the graph here what would you look back at this year as a highlight or  as an important key moment where maybe years from now we'll look back and say  wow yeah I remember that moment in 2019 I think that the natural products Expo  West this year or you know early 2019 there was some significant movement and  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:13:53):**  announcements from large organizations from General Mills from Danone who  really put out very strongly we're doing regenerative agriculture General Mills  committed to a million acres into regenerative agriculture by 2030 this  was a sort of watershed moment of not just larger organizations starting to  use the term but getting out there making public commitments launching  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:14:19):**  trials you know with not just organic but conventional farmers really I think  is driving both the consumer awareness of and excitement about regeneration but  also helping to build the supply and actually you know develop technology  develop support systems for regenerative farmers around the world this seems like  a really big thing that happened in 2019 how about you yeah for me it was  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:14:46):**  actually the moment we for the first time met was at an event in Oakland  where it seemed like the whole sector was together and we recorded actually a  short short looking back at that event but I think the event the regenerative  in food system investment forum the end of September beginning of October was  was a watershed moment not because there were 60,000 people there or because  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:15:10):**  there were enormous announcement but because it seemed like the whole sector  or a big part let's say 90% of the people that are working on this space on  the financing the investing and regenerative agriculture and food were  in the same room and was very it was a and quite an anonymous hotel room in the  Marriott but the electricity in the air was was extremely high and to have from  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:15:33):**  Dan Kittredge to John Kemp to Danone to General Mills all in the same room  people from New Zealand came over people from Europe obviously so it was for me  definitely a highlight and a few others were some media things actually Zach  Bush with the whole glyphosate discussion had a breakthrough and  probably will have many more I just saw a piece on Joe Rogan a huge podcaster  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:15:54):**  where they discussed regenerative agriculture savory and holistic  management from the food and medicine side of things very interesting very  short piece but so it seems like together with the biggest little farm  that came out and it's actually here as well and it seems like also on the media  side on the consumer side and on outside our little bubble this this whole idea  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:16:14):**  of soil region egg region food food as medicine is starting to to really catch  on so I think it was an extremely exciting year for for those reasons and  what are you looking forward to next year I think what I'm most excited about  is the intersection between regenerative agriculture which we both follow and  love but that intersection with regenerative business the rise of not  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:16:43):**  just doing regenerative agriculture in the supply system you know helping  farmers do better on the ground but then actually taking some of how to think  about a business and doing that in a regenerative way that's been growing  this year with the regenerative business summit with interest from many different  organizations so I think as regeneration as a paradigm starts to get into  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:06):**  business and investing that is an important thing that I think is going  to happen and have a larger stage in 2020 what about you very exciting yeah  I'm looking forward to keeping it very close to home a transition finance  series that we have been planning for a long time actually very much focused on  farmers so farmers that have done the pilots have read the books went to the  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:31):**  courses done the let's say landscape scale a redesign of their farm but they  are on very thin margins so they're missing appropriate transition finance to  speed up their transition and we're are actually recording at the moment the  first episodes where we take a farm in Germany and a farmer will be my co-host  Benedict Beuzel where we're gonna basically take his case which is a  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:17:55):**  thousand hectares relatively large especially in Europe and go to a number  of practitioners that are in the space of financing in regenerative agriculture  and food and say okay this is the case how would you finance this and how would  you finance it in a way that makes sense for soil investor and obviously farmer  so it's gonna be a very practical learning journey which we're gonna share  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:18:16):**  through the podcast and I'm very much looking forward to to that learning  journey and see if we can find appropriate finance in this case for  Benedict but obviously a lot of principles which should apply to many  many other farmers around the world all right well looking forward to 2020  thanks Koen for hosting and producing the podcast this year and I think a lot  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/31/regenerative-agriculture-industry-map-ft-ethan-soloviev-plus-review-2019/#t=0:18:38):**  more goods gonna come yeah thank you for for the map for the different newsrooms  we did for the different overviews and I'm looking forward to next year all  right thanks everyone thanks everyone bye

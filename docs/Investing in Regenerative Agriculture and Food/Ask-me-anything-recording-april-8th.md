### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2020-24-24)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  We're definitely going.  So what we'll do first of all welcome obviously could be late, could be early wherever you  
**[0:00:19-0:00:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:19):**  are.  What we'll do in this very informal agenda like structure.  I received some questions beforehand.  Some people emailed some questions beforehand and I'm definitely going to ask answer them  first and after that please feel free to answer or ask your questions in the chat room.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:39):**  Because if we all unmute at the same time it's going to be quite a bit chaos and I will  get to those questions and I will ask for any clarifying parts.  If you can obviously then unmute yourself the moment I'm getting to your question and  I will just keep everybody muted for now.  Thank you Laura in the call settings.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:00:57):**  That's a good question but so far we have done I think we have most people actually  on the call already.  So we'll get started and I will type I will copy and paste the questions we already got  and into the chat room so you can actually see it.  And the first one is from Trudy which is a very deep one we can spend more than an hour  
**[0:01:17-0:01:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:17):**  on probably.  Which is a greater obstacle to scaling up regenerative agriculture financing or cultural  slash educational issues like resistance and obviously of doing things differently.  It might come as a surprise for somebody that's been running and investing in regenerative  agriculture and food podcast but I definitely think it's the second part.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:36):**  Financing it may sound not so easy to hear if you're currently raising financing if you're  running a fund if you're running a farm and you've tried to raise finance but it seems  to be that there's a lot of willingness at least from investors to get active in the  space.  Definitely a lot of education needed on the investor side of things and let's actually  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:01:59):**  get Trudy into the question or into the waiting room because I just saw her joining.  So Trudy thanks for joining we're actually just getting to your question.  So I definitely think it's the second part and the cultural and the educational part  it's much more of a cultural shift than it is a finance shift.  Actually first and foremost a cultural one.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:19):**  Why because on the financing side we need to do a lot of education for a lot of investors  obviously on how soil works how region acts work and the timing the length the flexibility  etc.  But that we need to do in general in impact investing and I'm looking to Frank who has  been doing that for the last 25 years.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:37):**  When it comes to the receiving end of the investments there is a lot of work needed  there as well.  You have a structural seems to be a structural shortage of good projects to invest in.  It sounds horrible again if you're trying to raise money you cannot find anybody now  doesn't mean your product isn't good but it might be that the language you're using it  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:02:58):**  might be that the investability is not always the same as running a good project and you  should probably also really wonder if you want to raise any outside capital.  There are a lot of strings attached that comes with money and many people choose not to raise  outside capital and choose to run it on to grow it on cash flow bootstrap etc. etc.  So once you've made that decision to really do you want to raise outside capital there  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:03:25):**  are certain language things there are certain reporting which are not always easy for farms  because they're very very flexible and there's a great shortage of investable projects funds  farmers companies that are really getting regenerative agriculture to scale.  So I would say definitely the greater obstacle is currently the cultural and educational  side of things doesn't mean that we shouldn't do a lot of education on the investor side  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:03:53):**  of things because my question usually is when is the last time you talked to a farmer or  visited a farm and that could be a while ago or never which makes it very difficult to  run either a family office or a fund or any kind of financial institution that claims  to be focused on regenerative agriculture.  Trudy does that answer your question?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:13):**  I muted you.  I'm so sorry I missed.  I was just explaining the question so you didn't miss any part of the answer I think.  Okay okay.  So it's I think the bigger shift has to happen on in the on the food company level on the  
**[0:04:34-0:04:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:04:34):**  farm level on all of us as a consumer to really understand that what we believe to be the  normal is actually something that we can fundamentally change in a lifetime and that's quite a big  thing to ask from from all of us.  And there is the interest in the podcast interest in general in finance these things is growing  exponentially we did we just crossed a hundred thousand downloads actually two days ago and  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:03):**  seventy five percent of that was last year.  So just to see the size of I don't trust the stats too much of SoundCloud honestly but  it gives an idea the interest in the space is exploding and I think it's up to us to  create the structures the infrastructure the pipelines if you want of this space to to  put that energy part of that is money part of that is time part of a lot of people reach  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:27):**  out that they want to work in the space where where our job listings etc. we have to channel  that that energy because we need all of it we need to transition absolutely millions  and millions of farms and with that obviously we need to get farmers on the journey and  that requires all.  So the finance I'm less worried about it I'm definitely worried but I'm less worried about  
**[0:05:49-0:05:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:05:49):**  that compared to our outlook towards food and ag.  And then we received a second question I'm just going to meet Trudy again which is a  much more practical one and I'm of Adrian actually and so how does organic farming differ  from regen ag and would the transition from one to the other be relatively straightforward.  Again this is one we can probably spend two hours on and there are people on the call  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:06:18):**  and people I've interviewed that can give a way better answer on this the simple answer  as far as I know again I'm not a farmer and haven't run any regenerative farms at scale  ever.  Is that the traditional or the organic systems we know now especially the larger scale more  industrial size are much more they move from a conventional system and they move transition  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:06:44):**  to intrinsic to an organic one basically swapping inputs and swapping do a certain type of things  not and another basically changing a set of inputs for another set so less chemical less  basically switching the input side of things or the oil that's running the machine but  they didn't really fundamentally change the way they're operating one big example is obviously  plowing which happens a lot against weed pressure which doesn't happen if you're running an  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:07:11):**  advanced regenerative system so the second part of the question does it make it easier  if you're organic and switching from like could it be a stepping stone I think in terms  of mindset definitely yes and because you are working more with nature and less against  but I've seen many organic systems that are absolutely not regenerative and in some cases  actually more destructive than conventional systems so it it's not either or it's it's  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:07:37):**  definitely we need to go way beyond of actually the least the industrial size organic we've  lately seen and maybe go back to you at least the principles of the original organic but  obviously take into account that we have made we've seen huge changes in in terms of technology  in terms of understanding of soil in terms of research we're not at the same place where  we were 60 or 70 80 years ago we're in a very different place so it's both a step forward  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:08:02):**  and backwards Adrian does it I don't see you on the screen but I could that's because we  have a few and does it answer your question you should be able to unmute yourself where  Adrian maybe he fell off the call anyway we're recording it I will I will let him know I  see Martijn asked a question in the chat the claims of many advocates of Regen Ag seems  to be too good to be true higher yield higher nutrition value and better for the climate  
**[0:08:35-0:08:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:08:35):**  and environment what's the caveat higher costs I agree I think many especially lately we've  seen many many articles written many people basically claiming that Regen Ag is the tool  that will change everything overnight and and obviously soil will solve all the world  problems we can possibly imagine I think the caveat is is that that's simply not true everything  that sounds to be true usually is too good to be true it's not easy it requires a fundamental  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:09:06):**  shift of how we've been doing agriculture in many cases for a very long time not just  the last 40 years and it's definitely possible to do at least equal we've seen examples now  of equal yields and if you compare it on a crop by crop basis the complex thing obviously  is that many of the Regen Ag and let's say advanced farmers are multi cropping and it's  very difficult to compare to have an honest corn to corn let's say corn to corn research  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:09:37):**  if you're also doing two or three other crops in the same rotation so the the yield part  we see that the most advanced ones definitely get to the same let's say calories per acre  or per hectare as the conventional ones obviously with a lot less input so profitability is  is a huge driver for many farms to make the shift because many are shifting you see that  very often in Australia and the US because they simply they hit a wall and they cannot  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:10:02):**  pay for inputs anymore so they go and look for other ways of running running their farms  it's not easy and fast I think the the huge changes happen over time and they're very  very place dependent so almost every region has to figure out what's the most effective  design here to store the most carbon restore the most water or whatever you want that system  to do and it's not easy to incorporate trees into a big arable farm it's not easy to sell  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:10:34):**  your crops partly directly as many will discover now in our discovering in COVID it's not easy  to figure out things that actually nobody has ever figured out at that scale it's not  easy to find machinery to harvest certain things it's very great to do it on a hectare  where many things you can do by hand but what happens if you have two thousand hectares  what happens if you have twenty thousand what happens if you're super remote and you cannot  
**[0:10:56-0:11:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:10:56):**  sell directly so the easiness I think is the big caveat I would say most of the potential  benefits we still haven't really understood what happens if you do this at scale let's  say a full region a full island I've heard stories about Mallorca and other places like  what happens but actually happens to the climate and but basically the local climate does it  stabilize if you change your mono crop corn field for a multi crop does it and we see  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:11:23):**  some early results in that but we have only literally scratched the surface so I think  the caveat and Martijn is really it's it's a fundamental shift and we should not kid  ourselves that this is something that all farmers and all consumers will tomorrow knock  on our doors and say of course why didn't I think about this before it's a very fundamental  shift which requires a holistic approach from financing from funding from grant from tools  
**[0:11:49-0:11:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:11:49):**  from machinery from seeds input markets consumers the whole spectrum unfortunately or maybe  fortunately actually does that answer your question I see a nodding on this screen we  can honestly also spend an hour on justice obviously sorry go ahead no it does answer  my question and it seems that that's not maybe not necessarily higher cost but then because  it's not easy higher risks so that there is a there is a price we pay so it's a higher  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:12:19):**  risk I would I would argue not if you look at the the farmers that have been wiped out  by honestly this year the huge rains in the US where most farmers a lot of farmers in  the Midwest couldn't plant simply they couldn't get on the land because it was too wet so  the real I think we underestimate the risk of the current farming system and it's being  either covered by subsidies covered by crop insurance that is a subsidy covered by other  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:12:46):**  things so I think we we overestimate the returns and underestimate the risk of the current  system and if you look at the very advanced region farmers they they whether usually a  lot better when their neighbors are really suffering so the risk part I think is actually  very favorable because you're much more resilient and in some cases even you could argue anti-fragile  but it's for another call so I think the risk part is is actually much more interesting  
**[0:13:12-0:13:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:13:12):**  if you are if you're building your biggest asset which is at the end of the soil but  there's a price there's a price which is time there's a price to figure out there's a price  of becoming much more entrepreneurial as a farmer and and going where probably none of  your neighbors and none of the people I've heard stories of people that started to switch  and started in the transition and their children were no longer invited in the soccer team  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:13:36):**  and things like that so don't underestimate what it means to to go through this and I  think we all we are writing these amazing articles we're recording podcasts in my case  and and we we make it sound like it's a it's a walk in the park and but it's definitely  not so it's it's very easy from from the city to to argue and my my answer is always go  talk to farmers listen and and probably we all learn a lot okay I want to I saw galaxy  
**[0:14:07-0:14:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:14:07):**  note I don't see your name but you unmuted yourself which probably means you want to  add something or ask something or maybe not I won't mute you Vila I saw you had a question  if you're a beginning investor in region egg are there already European funds out there  to invest in can you describe the landscape of various funds so it my answer is usually  it depends which is not a very satisfying answer they are not so many they're not so  
**[0:14:34-0:14:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:14:34):**  many easy places where you as a either high net worth individual or retail investor or  somewhere in the middle can invest today there are a lot of people working on things but  a lot of people have been frozen obviously in the crazy time we're in and so the answer  is no I and the second part of that answer is it really depends what you would like to  do there are a number of funds that the strongest funds are the funds that have been in the  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:00):**  space for the low for the longest time usually in the US and Australia have been funds that  have been buying land and regenerating it and that is a more of an infrastructure play  very similar to renewable energy and those have had a track record and many are raising  the third fund or fourth fund etc and actually raising quite large amounts we can have a  long argument about land ownership and should it be concentrated or not and I think that's  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:23):**  an argument we need to have but those have been the most advanced in the space so far  in terms of funds that help current farmers to transition I've seen three experiments  maybe so far or three experiments are in process some are still under the radar and I think  we're going to see an explosion and that would be very interesting for people to invest in  because then you can invest alongside farmers and as they're going through the transition  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:15:49):**  without the land having to change ownership and obviously without a lot of money being  tied into the land but there the answer is in Europe I haven't seen anything I've seen  one crowdfunding platform in France which so far has only been open to French speaking  called mimosa so m-i-double-i sorry m-o-s-a and they have done small projects they partnered  with Danone and Carrefour to help some of their farmers transition so I'm guessing more  
**[0:16:19-0:16:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:16:19):**  of that will happen there but so far in Europe at least not an easy place to go please send  me stuff if you've seen things but I have not found too much I'm trying to obviously  keep keep an eye on the sector and also here as much as possible and from prisca does regenerative  just refer to the environmental aspect of agriculture or can it also apply imply regenerative  processes on social cultural and economic dimensions like fostering community building  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:16:54):**  I think the clear answer I think it's a personal answer my answer is definitely yes I see it's  very difficult to do regenerative agriculture and not do and not hit a lot of the social  aspects that we would like to see in this world as well I have to get to see an example  where that for instance happened it really depends on the focus of the farmer it focus  on of the fund the focus of the group that's running at the trust etc but almost always  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:17:22):**  I've seen a very close connection between the environmental and the social and I would  strongly argue that that we should keep it that way because otherwise why are we doing  it and I think there's a very interesting angle if you look at obviously the farm worker  side of things which in some countries is a much bigger issue in some other countries  a much smaller issue and which in most regenerative farms are much better treated farm workers  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:17:50):**  are much better treated than not but it's definitely something that also the crazy blog  post that it's going to save the world often focus on the carbon the water and the climate  and not so much on the social side of things I think a big potential impact we'll see on  the health care side which obviously is a social part as well when we truly dive deep  into the nutrient density of things and start to to discover which some early research now  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:18:16):**  is showing that this tomato being grown organically you find in the supermarket or this tomato  grown regeneratively relatively nearby are fundamentally different products and they  have very different nutrient contents and there you get a bit more tying into the too  good to be true area but we're going to see a lot of research coming out that a lot of  the food we thought was full of nutrients is actually quite empty and a lot of the food  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:18:46):**  that is grown very differently is actually almost medicine so we're going to have that  discussion of food as medicine which is going to sound very weird but it's going to be very  interesting and I think they're the social aspect is very strong in terms of learning  abilities in terms of we are literally what we eat and a lot of there's research on prisons  that when they started to to actually eat feed the prisoners cook the prisoners good  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:19:09):**  food a lot of the violence went down and things like that so I think we're going to see an  explosion on on food as medicine measurement and really see that connection healthy soil  healthy produce healthy gut systems and healthy people I mean think with your gut probably  comes obviously from there does it answer your question Prisca I take that as a yes  a Gadi how do you reconnect people and yourself see the concept of hydroponic growth technology  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:19:41):**  which are at least to some degree a closed circle of water and materials more efficient  controlled very suitable for cities obviously closer to consumers eliminating eliminating  much of the transportation environment and financial costs also here I think it depends  I see a lot of space for hydroponic especially on the leafy green side of things so the salads  the maybe some tomatoes and a lot of those many of them are not as energy efficient as  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:20:13):**  you would like so I would as an investor I would always ask the question and show me  the full circle like show me how much input it actually takes obviously anything grown  that doesn't need a lot of transportation is something to look at but often in these  systems they they claim a hundred percent closed loop with either fish or something  else but there's always obviously inputs going in because nothing I mean you need some kind  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:20:38):**  of fertilizer liquids you need something to to grow plants they don't grow out of nothing  especially not in soil not outside soil so I would very much look at the full input and  output like how much energy how much input where is it coming from is that a risk potentially  in pandemics when suddenly a certain fertilizer might not be delivered anymore etc etc etc  and I have done I think maybe one interview on greenhouses and slightly more controlled  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:21:08):**  environment also because there are huge limitations of how much we can actually grow like how  much of our daily diet can we grow in greenhouses or can we grow inside can we grow in hydroponic  systems and most of our calories come from a few crops unfortunately a weed rise etc  and they also occupy most of our land so if we want to have the impact on carbon on water  on farm workers on a lot of hectares or acres I think we're gonna look mostly actually not  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:21:39):**  to the vegetables but mostly to tree crops mostly to weed mostly to large broad acre  farms and land because that's what occupies so much of our of our planet unfortunately  obviously largely used for animal feed which is something that fundamentally has to change  so I see a lot of potential there to to reduce all the chemicals to reduce the tillage reduce  the fertilizer and and obviously I applaud any work that's being done in vegetables in  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:22:07):**  leafy greens but I would really look at the full input and output cycle because there's  there's a lot I see some of these decks and we come back to the two more time and that  really seemed to good be too good to be true like you only put a solar panel and and these  grow basically without inputs and that simply I would argue not possible and so really really  have a deep understanding of that but I think it's part of the puzzle maybe a small part  
**[0:22:33-0:22:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:22:33):**  but it's definitely part of the puzzle. Thanks again. Alexandra what's most lacking on farm  or farmers before on farm for farmers to required for the transition towards regen from conventional  data is obviously an issue in part that's not available testing soil is extremely difficult  and how to organize enable decision making support for farmers that brings all of the  variables including profitability market access together who's leading in this technology  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:08):**  so she sent two questions let's answer the first one first I think decision making support  is is absolutely crucial there and enormous amount of apps coming on the market that claim  to do that I don't have the answer which one actually works probably it really depends  on the crop types where you are but I do have a few questions I would always ask any of  these companies probably the first one is the last time you talk to a farmer and is  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:34):**  there a farmer on your board like is there actually a representative of the group you  are trying to reach and you'll be surprised you would think all of all of them at least  have a co-founder like you cannot do this without understanding your community of grain  farmers in the Midwest or you cannot do this without understanding your potato growers  in the Netherlands but you'll be surprised how many meaning very very well but come out  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:23:56):**  of this from we have to digitalize to farmers and and coming out of it from a very we have  to teach them something and we will show them how it's done because they are behind on XYZ  you'll be surprised and our farmers that have bought the latest drones when they came out  and they were 15,000 euros and have an amount of data that you can just not even process  to begin with so there's definitely a huge need to to help farmers decide they have a  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:24:21):**  very limited amount of time they usually have 40 50 harvest and need to make huge decisions  on very thin margins so I I don't know which ones are going to lead that I think we're  going to see a spectrum of some case farmer led because they much better understand what's  there obviously it's very different than running a tech company but I would be very careful  with a lot of tech companies and see how much they actually understand and are part of the  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:24:46):**  region egg movement and and obviously in your investment decisions always take into the  take into consideration the investment advice of a few forward-thinking region farmers they  are very good at filtering the noise from from the actually interesting things because  they need to make those decisions every day and so tech is going to be crucial I don't  think we can all imagine what's going to be possible in a number of years and from robotic  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:25:13):**  to software to making good farmers decisions what to plant where and why which is still  a very underdeveloped piece but it's going to be very difficult to to get a connection  with a large amount large amount of a group farmers big enough to actually make that a  valuable valuable business without obviously taking the data selling it off and and doing  the traditional model which has made farmers very let's say skeptical of outside outsiders  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:25:41):**  coming in with the latest techno gizmo to help them does it answer your first question  Alexander?  In part I think with that one it's a longer conversation that you and I've had to some  degree before yes your second your second question on carbon market potential what are  your views on this how when and who?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:26:08):**  That's a really good question where we can again spend an hour on how I think most of  the models so far have been or most of the business model so far have been based on models  either Comet Farm or some others I I don't see and those models have been based on a  lot of academic research which has shown in the past to really either very underestimate  or not take into consideration a lot of the carbon parts so I see some some test farms  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:26:40):**  actually which are profitable or commercial farms that are doing twice the rate of what  Comet Farm predicted in terms of carbon sequestration doesn't mean that they are right it means  that we just don't know and so I think we're going to see a lot of actually on the like  to really try to actually measure it and not based on a model it's going to be very difficult  so that probably answers your when not not tomorrow and but the customers are going to  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:05):**  want to see this customers are going to buy carbon credits a removal credit storage and  I bought them through Nori for instance and I actually have an interview coming out next  week with Nori and not to plug it but they are they're definitely building a piece of  the puzzle there but it's very I think customers at the front runners all of us probably will  buy them because we just want this to happen but later stage where customers are going  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:29):**  to ask for can you actually prove that this has been stored and that this has been stored  over a long time and then hopefully we're going to see the second part of your question  what's the role of agroforestry inclusion in regen farmers and regen farms and we're  going to see hopefully then a raise for okay what's the the fastest sequestration farm  we can design if that's what you want if you want most biomass if you want most produce  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:27:54):**  if you want most carbon I think we're going to see different models compete and I don't  see why trees are not going to be part of that for all the extra benefits they have  but obviously they have a huge benefit on carbon and so I think as until they are part  of the models or until we're going to measure actual carbon sequestration and actually how  long that's going to be you're going to struggle on that piece but there will be a lot of interest  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:28:17):**  in the space because people wake up daily for the amount of what we can actually do  in terms of soil management both above ground and underground that the interest for this  is just going to explode again there's going to be a lot of noise and so it's going to  be asking the right questions and who's actually actually farmers first I think also here who  actually includes farmers in the decision making process and in the design process because  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:28:40):**  at the end of the day you're not going to get millions of farmers to sign up if you  don't really and to actually get them for to commit for 10 or 15 years if you don't  really build this from the ground up with farmers. Does that answer your second question?  Yeah I mean I think consistency of how we measure is obviously a priority issue there  and then secondly how you track credits as we know so why would you go and whose marketplace  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:29:12):**  why Indigo versus Nori versus whomever everyone's going to compete for this and which customers  are doing it for the sake of branding benefit right now because that's aligned Patagonia  etc there are some that will move there were some that were not how do you ensure that  you double don't double count credits but as you say I'm I share the same thesis of  want to make it happen therefore let's see how to do that.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:29:38):**  We're very early that's the I think the and there's a big open question will be just carbon  will it be water maybe moving first will it be all three so biodiversity carbon and water  what what what other because we can make a whole list of ecosystem services obviously  and around that. So I'm going to move to Chloe is there a minimum dimension of the land to  start thinking to switch to region egg? I don't think so I think there's I mean probably  
**[0:30:09-0:30:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:30:09):**  a square meter is very small but I would say from the farmers I know the principles there  the approaches really differ obviously in terms of context and place could be a small  holder farmer in Ghana could be a large scale farmer in the Midwest but the principles are  always the same which is about ground cover which is about very no or very little disturbance  of the soil which is about complex rotations both in time and in place meaning both obviously  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:30:44):**  over the years but also in the same place meaning no no monoculture approaches. So the  principles of all these farmers big and small fully organic or somewhere on the way are  usually the same which sort of indicates that it's a set of principles that could be applied  on a soccer field or could be applied on your backyard garden which maybe allows you to  do a lot more things than you would otherwise not be allowed because you basically can do  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:31:07):**  you can monitor very easily and do a lot of things by hand. So it seems to be all the  way from very intensive small scale permaculture to very extensive thousands of hectares of  agroforestry systems it seems to be scaling quite nicely but it's very context dependent  and that makes it so difficult for funds to operate for things to selling for inputs to  develop because it really really really depends where you are and that makes it very tricky  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:31:36):**  and also to build companies that could be huge because how many can you really serve  with your input supply how many can you really help in terms of training if your approach  maybe only works in this bio region or so it also challenged a lot of a lot of that  but I don't think but please correct me if I'm wrong that there's necessarily a dimension  small scale or large scale obviously you want to be commercially farming that's a different  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:32:04):**  discussion but also there depends on context I've seen people very comfortably getting  a family income of a very small plot and I've seen obviously farmers at a huge scale that  are not even that are below the poverty line so it really depends. Frank what does regenerative  farming really implies is it biological food so both of which I think are food for us or  permaculture so it's primarily an approach of it could imply all of these but it's a  
**[0:32:37-0:32:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:32:37):**  primarily approach to a farmer or a landowner or land user to rebuilding soil most of it  are extremely degraded and so it's a set of principles it's a set of approaches to to  build basically soil and that could mean a range of different things could be that you're  applying permaculture I've seen many that are mixing things they are using certain certain  approaches from permaculture they're using certain approaches from organic agriculture  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:33:03):**  they're using certain approaches from food for us it really depends on the context but  it's keeping the ground covered at all time using complex rotations in time and space  no or very very low depending on the location but usually no tillage and there's an element  of probably at some point integrating livestock into a certain into the rotation but also  that really depends on location so it's a context specific set which I usually say it  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:33:33):**  goes way beyond organic but the very simple one is to ask your farmer are you building  soil or not and the region farmers is interesting because you usually have a very long discussion  when you first met them meet them not about their produce not about the oranges they grow  not about whatever vegetables they grow but actually about their soil so you can sort  of spot the regenerative farmers because they're more enthusiastic about their soil growing  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:33:56):**  than the produce which sort of happens to be a byproduct so it's quite interesting I've  seen regenerative livestock so chick actually a chicken operation that I've mainly talked  about grass and only after an hour we somehow got to oh yeah but I'm actually to grow the  grass I'm using this and this and this principles so it's an interesting it's a different mindset  not making it easier or less easy obviously than organic but organic is much more established  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:34:24):**  in terms of duties this and this and you can be organic and don't do this in terms of regenerative  it's it's a bit more fluid but it all comes down to are you building soil and are you  building soil at least in my case at scale. Willem shared a fund aqua spark which is very  personal to me because I used to work there thank you for sharing that and I mean I think  it triggers an interesting thought in a sense that I've only interviewed one or two I think  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:34:50):**  but there's a huge space we never cover when we talk about region and which is obviously  the oceans and there's an enormous potential from seaweed farming to mix cropping also  there and I think we we are only just scratching the surface of what is possible when we restore  the oceans and there you can ask exactly the same question to any fish investment or any  ocean investment you might be considering and are you restoring the oceans and if so  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:16):**  how are you measuring it can you report on it and I think the the potential there in  terms of climate in terms of nutrients in terms of fixing runoff issues is probably  maybe even bigger than in all the the land area combined because it's just so much bigger  and it turns out that for instance there's some research coming out in terms of whales  that are sort of the grazers of the the ocean and actually storing an enormous amount of  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:35:39):**  of co2 and and restoring just a whale population would already help a lot so there's a lot  of things and there they see is there on the call in terms of seaweed which she knows much  more about that there's to discover and actually they're very interesting connection between  farms runoff obviously but also farms and and the nearby ocean or the nearby sea in  terms of seaweed which can be used as a fertilizer and and obviously captures a lot of the runoff  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:36:05):**  seaweed can obviously be eaten and so there's a lot to discover there I'm definitely planning  to to do more that there also considering my my history at Aquaspark and I see a link  here which I will not click on now William regenerative resources an American organization  looking for funds I will dive into that after can you if I just make sure on the one of  the first question somebody asked what our funds to invest in so these two came on the  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:36:36):**  top of my mind and that's why I put them in and I think a third one could be common lands  in the Netherlands who also she's an NGO yeah so they're definitely yeah they're definitely  places I would there are a lot of places to to have these discussions but an easy list  their soil wealth which is a big report and if somebody could put them in the chat that  would be great but it's mostly us and a very small percentage of the funds they have listed  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:37:02):**  are actively many are actively measuring soil health so I would always argue ask for measurement  active measurement of soil health but there's it's definitely growing like every day I had  a discussion two days ago about a group that is launching now if he paused every generative  they call it sustainable but it was for different reasons let's say regenerative public publicly  listed farmland income trust on the long stock exchange won't be listed for the next few  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:37:34):**  weeks because nothing is listed but that would mean that it's suddenly accessible for retail  investors and and so there's there are a lot of people thinking about vehicles to make  this accessible and start financing this transition thank you for sharing those okay I'm trying  to catch up because otherwise we're never going to get through this I see a question  of Janessa a few of my Californian growers are looking to just quickly scanning it because  
**[0:38:01-0:38:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:38:01):**  otherwise I'm reading it all so she's asking if there are any advisors consultants that  could have her Californian growers to switch so there are many many I would quote unquote  gurus in this in this space and many advisors and consultants it hasn't been organized very  well so far that you can easily search and and find who in your crop type area etc is  very good so the answer is I don't know and I know that act talent who are interviewed  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:38:37):**  is trying to do this mostly for the Australian market but I think we definitely need better  searchable directories etc I'm sure they are there but I haven't seen too many and let's  say these these consultants come recommended lists or something like that so that's actually  an opportunity like we need we need many of these agronomists independent not paid by  the input companies to to help growers and to help cooperatives or to help groups of  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:39:03):**  farmers to transition actually soil capital but it's very European focused at the moment  is working on on just that to basically build an army of independent agronomists that have  experience in region egg are being trained to to really be even more experienced and  are not paid by the input companies are free to advise and and not basically have to to  sell anything because usually these are normally their salespeople so soil capital is working  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:39:31):**  on it unfortunately not in California but you might could reach out to them to see if  they know anybody so Sarah is asking a question where do you see the role of product innovation  currently work I'm working on algae based soil regeneration and drought mitigation are  these opportunities out there for early stage innovations do you know any farmers groups  or organizations in Europe who want to co-create I'm not a techie I'm a permaculture gardener  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:40:02):**  so that's a good question there are many far how do you would find you you're basically  asking what are what could be early adopters of the work you're doing yeah basically so  I mean I actually see great connection with what you just mentioned actually connecting  aquaculture with agriculture so that that's one of my main points that I'm working on  actually connecting the blue and green so we're really concretely now in product innovation  
**[0:40:33-0:40:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:40:33):**  and since it's quite a new field to actually connect this aquaculture and agriculture I'm  not quite sure where to look in terms of finding co-creators or funders I'm looking at the  more general like sustainability fellowships and things like that but I'm wondering if  there's anyone out there that maybe we could think of partnering with or you know go a  little bit deeper into this innovation together yeah I think what it really depends where  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:41:02):**  you are but you're you're based in in Western Europe right yeah yeah so it would definitely  in this case in the Netherlands find groups like common land or find groups of farmers  of violent that are already at least somewhere in the transition and to to test sorry to  test with them I know a number of farmers that actually have used also in an island  seaweed as fertilizer or are also using it obviously as a livestock feed ingredient which  
**[0:41:29-0:41:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:41:29):**  greatly reduce the methane so it's it's finding those groups of farmers could be the research  actually yeah so finding those groups of early adopters that are willing to donate or make  available one or two hectares just to try a few things and yes it's the the common land  project just north of Amsterdam okay with a big group of farmers so they are definitely  let's say on the front end of this plus a lot of the farmers they would know all the  
**[0:42:00-0:42:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:42:00):**  other farmers in Europe or in in the Netherlands as well that are potentially open to this  really interesting can I can ask you one more question but you want to go down the list  and that's kind of more the dilemma is what the target group you're focusing on is it  the farmers that are already doing well that are already really deep into regenerative  farming or should you actually also be targeting the mainstream you're just beginning the transition  
**[0:42:26-0:42:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:42:26):**  what's your view personal and with you you mean you as a seaweed project or me no you  what's your personal view on it for me I've very similar to my view and impact investing  I've spent a lot of time trying to convince people certain things I don't think that's  very effective so I decided to focus on the front runners and to focus on on people that  I'm always happy to share something on soil obviously but to to help the front runners  
**[0:42:58-0:43:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:42:58):**  to to go faster and to do more because I think we're gonna see more change faster if we had  a hundred years I wouldn't be too worried and because most farmers will at some point  discover and we'll start focusing on soil will go deep into YouTube and find gay Brown  and others and start learning and will be fine but we have 10-15 years so convincing  is going to take at least in my personal view too long and so we either incentivize through  
**[0:43:24-0:43:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:43:24):**  carbon payments of take agreements and other or we partner with with the front runners  to to move faster and communicate about it so we obviously create more front runners  otherwise thanks and let's go down the list because otherwise take Lana do you see big  opportunities in ocean yes I think we already answered that so let's keep moving Sam and  the director of main stats down which is an urban farm in Amsterdam region egg principles  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:44:00):**  we're looking for investments mainly for a center of excellence on region farming and  what would be the most efficient way to find investments it's a very difficult question  because obviously the answer is it depends I would argue mostly for any type of investments  like this which is an urban farm located in Amsterdam to try to find it as much as possible  locally you need people with a connection locally I mean it's one thing if you're in  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:44:30):**  the middle of nowhere in the center of France and maybe locally there's not so much capital  around but in this case you're in Amsterdam which is obviously one of the financial centers  of of Europe and I would really try to find people with a connection to this space and  try to figure out if you're honestly looking for an investment or a grant or a mix and  get first of all very very clear what you're looking for and why because it's the first  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:44:55):**  question any funder or investor will ask and then really search for a local connection  because you're going to need that to to compete with any other investment decks etc that investors  are going to get does it answer your question Sam I saw you unmuted I'm unmuted right now  yes of course I also understand that it is a hard question to answer but still thanks  for your reply and I totally agree with you I get really really clear what you need it  
**[0:45:28-0:45:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:45:28):**  for and why because maybe you don't and and smart investors will will see through that  immediately I see many people to say I am gonna raise capital I need to raise capital  after two or three questions of why why why probably it's not the case or probably they  don't need it or there are other ways to to raise capital or to to grow and scale yeah  that's a valid answer and also so true I would love to talk longer about this but please  
**[0:45:56-0:46:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:45:56):**  continue with the other questions thank you so much thanks Jeff the publicly listed company  it's not publicly listed they were supposed to learn I'm looking at the month ago which  obviously got shelved so I hope to do an interview anytime soon they are thinking about some  where this year so no listed yet you can search but I don't think you will find it at maybe  I mean they're public but they are not publicly listed yet then we get to villain there is  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:46:27):**  a list of concert consultants I will look into that out dot initiative so for consultants  Janessa villain put something in there in the chat box if you want to have a look Alexandra  John Kempf definitely interesting to speak with I had him on the phone yesterday actually  very interesting guy John Kempf a very interesting podcast for anybody interested in podcasts  otherwise you're not here and his company is called advancing eco agriculture and they  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:46:54):**  do a lot of work also in California so I cannot I haven't worked with him in terms of as a  consultant so I cannot as a farmer but definitely somebody to to reach out to Chuck also in  has been on the podcast of so capital knows him well and yeah we actually met in Oakland  at the investment the regenerative food system investment for so that thank you Alexandra  for sharing that interesting podcast they share a lot they share a lot of webinars they  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:47:21):**  share a lot of information and that's actually the list so if anybody has another question  please unmute yourself oh there's another one yours can you sketch several scenarios  of how a transition to region and could look like in terms of time and yours can you unmute  yourself and maybe so I'm I'm very new to this I don't know a lot about region agriculture  in general but I was just interested in how like a transition on a large scale would look  
**[0:47:57-0:48:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:47:57):**  like in like how can you if you put in a certain amount of investment in a certain area like  if you have this knowledge base set up for like convincing farmers to switch more to  regenerative farming basically having the science back up for convincing people how  that speed up farmers and or how would that impact the world in terms of co2 yeah sure  so I wouldn't be doing this I didn't think it would make a considerable carbon difference  
**[0:48:33-0:48:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:48:33):**  in the next 10 to 15 years because that's probably pretty much the window we have that  answer is again it really depends on on the farm and the location we we've seen or I've  seen changes especially if you have it also depends on the climate obviously stuff grows  a lot faster in tropics where things happen a lot faster so if you're looking for the  fastest growth of soil or biomass of anything definitely pick the climate to do that the  
**[0:49:03-0:49:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:03):**  climate is extremely important to that but if you're looking for the most degraded soils  you probably get to the areas which has been farmed the longest and so if you want to the  biggest bang for your buck probably you will look at heavily degraded soil that have been  in conventional chemical driven agriculture for the longest and bring in quite a bit of  biomass which is a lot of compost and and start to figure out okay what's the quickest  
**[0:49:29-0:49:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:29):**  one I want to do but it really depends if you need to live of the cash flow during that  transition obviously you make smaller steps if you have a 10-year window or a five-year  window you don't need any cash flow out of the business and you can also do certain things  that otherwise you can't so it can go quite fast you've seen we've seen changes in produce  in levels of zinc etc in one or two seasons and from changing management practices but  
**[0:49:53-0:49:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:49:53):**  to really build up trees to build up advanced agroforestry systems especially not in the  tropics you need seven to ten years because it takes time for the trees to grow we can  speed it up in a lot of ways by changing the tree planting methods by selecting other types  etc so it's both fast and slow and really depending on the location but I think you  would be surprised if you visit the most advanced one how fast things can go if we get the right  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:50:20):**  processes mostly in systems in place but it's a lot of knowledge that we're developing now  in terms of what's actually the speed of things we can do and and it's constantly surprised  me of how fast things are but it if you have a typical grain field and you're going to  switch to a 10-year rotation and you're bringing in five or ten types of cover crops it will  take a bit of time before the soil starts to recover from from all the chemicals and  
**[0:50:46-0:50:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:50:46):**  starts to actually slowly live again that might take three to five years just to get  through the the shock of less fertilizer and to get through the shock of less and less  chemicals so it really depends what you start with if you want to have the fastest carbon  it usually ends up being like Alex Runder mentioned some kind of system with trees involved  and you need fast growing species in a mix with others etc does that answer your question  
**[0:51:11-0:51:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:51:11):**  thank you  I see Julie sent another question by email which I'm not going to check now so I will  get back to that there is a farmland read which I'm also not going to click on it but  thank you for for sharing I will have a look not sure if they have a strong region ag focus  usually when they don't mention anything they don't but it's I'm always happy to be to be  
**[0:51:39-0:51:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:51:39):**  surprised obviously and Martijn is asking what budget would be required to set up a  large-scale region farm in the Netherlands and what would be reasonable annual return  expectations that's a question I really don't know I know that I think the average hectare  costs are about 80 to 90,000 so it depends what you mean by large scale but that's if  you want to buy land that's pretty much what you're looking at and then you need still  
**[0:52:06-0:52:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:06):**  the capital on top of that to to really start making investments I'm seeing in terms of  annual return that's maybe some I see some funds now or vehicles that were being set  up in the US and they're targeting let's say 8 to 12 percent on an annual basis which is  partly coming from the produce partly from the the asset growing in or getting a higher  valuation so those are the numbers they are looking at and they're raising capital which  
**[0:52:35-0:52:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:35):**  seems that investors are liking that and what that would mean in the Netherlands I don't  know because I don't think anybody has done that and you'll be figuring out what are the  offtake agreements needed who's buying is somebody buying the carbon which obviously  influences your return quite a bit because it's free extra cash are you going for a 10-year  system which means you involve a lot of trees which means you have to wait do you need to  
**[0:52:59-0:53:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:52:59):**  live with the cash flow it's an interesting exercise I think some people in the Netherlands  would be would be interested to to look at that it really depends on large scale if you're  buying land a lot of your money will be locked into buying the land and that just limits  what you can do that's one of the reasons I'm not focusing only for instance on large  funds that are raising capital to buy land because I think there's a limit of how much  
**[0:53:23-0:53:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:23):**  money there's available to to get into those funds even if they raise 10 billion etc how  much actual land can we buy and thus influence with that is limited and if you look at systems  or processes or vehicles that are working with farmers this potential to scale is much  higher because you don't need to buy the land and you don't have obviously the whole discussion  on land ownership so there's definitely there's a lot of learnings in these large funds because  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:53:47):**  they operate at a large scale but I think there's also sort of natural limit of how  much they can actually raise and how much hectares and acres we can influence with that  but we need them I think in terms of lessons learned we need them in terms of co2 now we  need them in terms of of large offtake agreements there's there's a lot of people going to be  trained on those farms to do this at scale which is absolutely essential because we don't  
**[0:54:07-0:54:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:54:07):**  have enough farmers that are able to do this multi cropping very complex rotations of 15  types of cover crops mixing in with etc etc they're not let many people that can do that  at and want to do that honestly at remote locations etc so I think a lot of the capital  will be locked into the land which is maybe something to consider if you want to have  the most impact Anastasia hello from Greece we grow cherries and figs if anybody or anyone  
**[0:54:37-0:54:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:54:37):**  is interested let's connect so definitely anybody that's interested in cherries and  figs maybe from mediterranean countries and please connect with Anastasia Alexandra is  a longer conversation which is interesting because we're on top of the hour the investment  thesis for rewilding very interesting question as one of the most listened episodes definitely  read the book if you haven't isabella tree obviously she's called tree fascinating book  
**[0:55:02-0:55:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:02):**  anything you thought anything I thought at least about nature was being debunked I think  15 times in the book alone and thought about rewilding management how much do you have  to do and how much you cannot do how fast can nature come back so it comes back to your  question yours I think there's a very interesting case of integrating rewilding into rotations  so there are two cases I think there's a very interesting to integrate rewilding into rotations  
**[0:55:27-0:55:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:27):**  what would happen if you managed rewilding so it's not just putting a fence and wait  and but actually manage the process and integrate certain things and actually speed up the process  of rewilding what if that will be part of a 20-year rotation so you have a 20-year rewilding  and then you go back to regenerative AG for a few years and you go back to you so you  sort of move in and out what would that mean for nutrient levels I think that's a very  
**[0:55:50-0:55:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:55:50):**  interesting like what what would the produce do when it comes off the land and I think  it's the second part and we talked a bit about that in the interview is how do you integrate  this into farms in into pieces that are not extremely productive how do you rewild pieces  of your farm of your operation that are anyway not the most economically profitable pieces  and how can you manage that actively to let biodiversity simply explode and and I think  
**[0:56:16-0:56:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:56:16):**  Isabella and her husband Charlie have shown that you can actually go on safari in and  just just south of London and see an amount of biodiversity that if somebody said that  20 years ago and that that would grow there and say they have more nightingales than most  of the wildlife areas nearby and so it's it's it challenges a lot of our thought about how  an area should look like in terms of forest versus open canopy oak trees large animals  
**[0:56:45-0:56:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:56:45):**  many many insects and so I think there's a huge role so far they're mostly two different  worlds so that we're not really talking the region egg people and the rewilding people  are not really talking I think that's a huge mistake because we're after the same things  and I think there's a lot of integration and that can happen  Trudy so actually Sam sent a message to Martijn and which Martijn can answer what do you think  
**[0:57:10-0:57:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:10):**  about large-scale Trudy can you say more about funding that it takes for the ownership of  land versus the funding that supports the farmers and owners to transition to reid and  egg and is funding that it takes for the ownership a bad deal for the farmer here it really depends  on what the farmer wants to do in the farmer family I've seen examples in Canada and I  just want to say so we're on top of the hour if anybody wants to leave obviously feel free  
**[0:57:32-0:57:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:32):**  also before I will finish these questions and which might mean that we're around 10  minutes over or something and but feel free to to jump to your next call jump to a coffee  or tea wherever you are but I will try to finish these questions and then call it a  day can you say something about the funding what she asked so I've seen examples of people  taking outside capital to buy land of their neighbors and then slowly growing into that  
**[0:57:57-0:58:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:57:57):**  in Canada I've seen examples of so there are many many flavors I think it really depends  what the farmer wants to do if a comfortable size is what they already have there's no  need to buy other land if it's more comfortable on the long term to have the land in a trust  which is governed by a certain set of principles and then the farmer leases the land to a certain  certain long period I mean there's so many shapes and forms available there I don't I  
**[0:58:27-0:58:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:58:27):**  think there's a larger discussion we need to have on land ownership and and does it  make sense to have that in a very concentrated group of people but that's part of the region  egg discussion as well and I think we're going to have a lot of different shapes and forms  of trust of farms buying other farms of groups of people getting together forming a cooperative  and buying large farms for for their food etc etc so I don't see I think the impact  
**[0:58:53-0:58:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:58:53):**  is going to be working with current farmers simply because they already have the land  and they need to transition and the largest the fastest the hectares we can do are probably  from partnering with current farmers and land owners because they could be also investment  funds that already have the land but don't know what to do or don't know how to they're  probably underperforming what they could do there there somebody nicely set underperforming  
**[0:59:17-0:59:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:59:17):**  landscapes which for investors should be should be quite interesting.  Alexandra is asking how important is certification that's an open question I have no idea I see  obviously Patagonia and Dr. Bronner's and Rodale working in ROC regenerative organic  certification which is interesting and raises a million and a half questions I really don't  know I think it really depends on if consumers need certification or if we're going and or  
**[0:59:50-0:59:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=0:59:50):**  we're going down a nutrient density route and so if we're going down a nutrient density  route and we're going to communicate on what's actually in your food maybe certification  isn't needed anymore but I don't know I think time will only tell sorry not not a very satisfying  answer I know.  Augusto do you believe the lack of wealthy accepted ESG frameworks to evaluate farming  
**[1:00:12-1:00:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:00:12):**  investments remain a key roadblock?  I think that the lack of accepted ESG is a key roadblock for for anything in impact investing  so also in regenerative agriculture I think the savory certification from is based on  outcome which is very interesting Rodale ROC is still very early but also very interesting  so time will tell I think it's the same same answer to to Alexander's question we can only  
**[1:00:46-1:00:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:00:46):**  we can only wait and and get involved as investors practitioners farmers to make sure we shape  these to to something that serves all of us and not just certification bodies not just  consumers but actually obviously farmers and get all stakeholders on here.  Does the EU common agriculture policy encourage region egg?  At the moment not or very very little there's a lot of work and lobbying being done to try  
**[1:01:13-1:01:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:01:13):**  to change that and actually on the so at the moment it's not extremely helpful and I think  you can ask 20 farmers and most of them will tell you that a lot of the legislation a lot  of the subsidy schemes are actually against a lot of these things because they pay you  to plow or they pay you to do certain practices which have been outdated for already 20 years  and so for the moment not I know there's a lot of work being done by a number of European  
**[1:01:40-1:01:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:01:40):**  bodies to change that but of course there's an enormous lobby effort from the mostly the  input companies because that's what they are depending on and which is their livelihood  so we're going to see the same kind of lobbying we see with fossil fuel it's a very similar  probably using the same lobby groups actually to do that.  Thank you Sarah for sharing the book and I think that's it I reached the end of the questions  
**[1:02:10-1:02:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:10):**  thank you so much for if anybody has a question definitely unmute now and otherwise we'll  call it a day and I will do this another time soon I hope it was interesting relevant and  have a nice evening nice morning wherever you you are or a nice night actually if you're  in Singapore because I know some called it.  Thank you so much.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:40):**  Dear friends of the podcast I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[1:02:58-1:03:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:02:58):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned  what have we seen in the space over the last years how have we built our decision-making  framework what to focus on with the podcast how have we picked interviewees and what questions  should you ask what is happening in the space what should you read what should you listen  
**[1:03:23-1:03:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:03:23):**  what should you watch how to approach this space for whom is this course you the soil  builders and investors in this space the soil builders people working in this space entrepreneurial  farmers fund managers vehicle builders crowd investing platform builders egg tech companies  farm to gut food companies permaculture key line designers holistic management consultants  etc etc people that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own  
**[1:03:50-1:03:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:03:50):**  money to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are  putting other people's money to work through foundations institutional capital banks insurance  companies etc is this course free no this is pay what you think it's worth meaning I  have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware that among  the listeners of this podcast and we have people with very different means so I'm inviting  
**[1:04:15-1:04:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:04:15):**  you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to consider paying  what you think it's worth thank you so what is this course it's currently a series of  seventeen videos mostly ranging from ten to fifteen minutes plus PDF slides so you don't  have to ride along we're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why  extractive agriculture is so risky how to invest what kind of frameworks you could and  
**[1:04:42-1:04:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:04:42):**  I think should build what to invest in what kind of co-investors you could find or what  kind of investors you could find if you're a soil builder every lesson will have a digging  deeper part where I will share what kind of reports what kind of interviews what kind  of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper we're gonna look at nutrient density  landscape design and a lot more so what is it not it's not a list of investable deals  
**[1:05:06-1:05:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/ama-webinar-4-8-2020/#t=1:05:06):**  unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world we're really at the beginning of the regenerative  agriculture and food revolution it's also not investment advice before making any investment  please find professional investment advice so get ready get a cup of coffee a cup of  tea or whatever you're drinking click on the link below sign up and I'm really looking  forward to your feedback.

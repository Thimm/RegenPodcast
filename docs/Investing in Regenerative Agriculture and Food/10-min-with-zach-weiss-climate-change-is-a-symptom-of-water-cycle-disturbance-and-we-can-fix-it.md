**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:00):**  You're listening to the summary of the interview. For a link to the full-length episode, please check the description below.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:09):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the Planet Mattered,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:14):**  a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:19-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:19):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:26):**  while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:29):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration? Because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:34):**  have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:38):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers, start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:47):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I will definitely continue to do so  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:53):**  and release about an episode a month. But at the same time, I would love to take this further,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:58):**  share more interviews, there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture,  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:03):**  more depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:08):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:12):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:19):**  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:24):**  And now, without further ado, the interview. Enjoy!  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:29):**  I'm joined by Zach Wise of Elemental Ecosystems, working on water retention landscapes.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:34):**  For me, it was a really deep and profound love for nature.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:38):**  And I always wanted to find something where I was working in nature outside as much as possible  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:44):**  and how to help people connect better with nature.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:49):**  I think a real logical place to start is food and water because it's something that every human needs  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:55):**  and ingests many times a day, and that's our most direct and immediate connection to nature and to the landscape.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:04):**  Yeah, so if you think water is really moving through the landscape, it's moving through the air,  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:10):**  it's moving through the ground, and it's constantly in motion.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:15):**  So the full healthy water cycle is forests that are seeding the moisture in the air, causing clouds and then precipitation.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:25):**  That phase change draws in more precipitation, and so you have this pump.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:30):**  It's called the biotic pump, where the living ecosystems of the continents actually draw moisture from the oceans,  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:39):**  from the evaporation inland to the different continents.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:43):**  And so that's what we call the full or the natural water cycle.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:47):**  Now, the half water cycle is the increasingly disturbed water cycle.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:52):**  And so it's a water cycle of extremes where the landscape is cleared.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:57):**  So for one, the water that used to infiltrate runs off quickly downstream, leading to flooding,  
**[0:03:05-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:05):**  but then followed by drought and in the worst case is fire because the landscape is not being recharged with the water, it's being desiccated.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:16):**  Water is the ultimate capital of any farmer.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:21):**  So what we're creating is decentralized water retention landscapes.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:26):**  So where water is being held at different points all throughout the landscape,  
**[0:03:30-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:30):**  and what this does is it makes it so that your irrigation is underground, your landscape is sub-irrigated.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:37):**  So you don't need to apply all that energy to move the water,  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:40):**  but you're also in this very long term vision with the water,  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:46):**  where the actions you're doing in this year are going to be felt for the next century.  
**[0:03:52-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:52):**  It's becoming more extreme. So everywhere that I go this year, I've worked on five continents and every place,  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:00):**  it's the same story where the precipitation is more when it comes and it's less often.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:06):**  And so that's something that we designed for.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:12):**  With these large centralized dams and reservoirs that are actually very ecologically destructive  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:18):**  and then very energy intensive to move the water around,  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:22):**  whereas if you create it in harmony with nature as a decentralized infrastructure,  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:27):**  it's actually cheaper, it functions much better, and it's easier to build.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:34):**  The people with a lot of money and influence are really starting to see what's coming  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:40):**  and starting to put in place the solution for the coming problems.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:46):**  So for example, Sepp Holzer's son, Josef, is working for the oldest organic winery in Europe  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:55):**  because they can see that all of these water shortages are coming  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:59):**  and they want to get their water retention put in now before it really becomes dire.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:04):**  And so we are seeing more and more of these big players in the agricultural sector, but also other sectors.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:12):**  One of the areas that I look at a lot of potential here is in flood, fire, and drought mitigation and prevention.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:21):**  If you think one fire in California is two and a half billion dollars of damage,  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:28):**  and these events are happening every year,  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:32):**  we do certainly need more and more people trained up in doing this kind of work.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:37):**  That's something there's a huge shortage of right now.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:42):**  Well, I can see why the regenerative ag community and the permaculture community pushes itself towards design and consulting  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:53):**  because there's no risk, there's no work, there's no...  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:57):**  I mean, you need to have some rough skill set, but you don't really need a skill set to do it.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:03):**  You need to have some rough skill set, but you don't really need a skill set.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:08):**  And so it's very easy to do, it's very easy to make a living doing that,  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:13):**  but you're not actually creating restored landscapes.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:18):**  And that's where we really need people putting their time and energy.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:23):**  I think that there's actually this huge untold story here  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:27):**  that when it comes out is going to be something that's actually immensely hopeful  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:32):**  and is something that could also bridge the two sides because there's...  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:37):**  This is going to kind of open up another discussion which we may not want to get into,  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:41):**  but if you look at the first climate models, they assumed our impact on the water cycle was neutral.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:48):**  And water vapor is the main greenhouse gas.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:52):**  So there's all this water vapor in the atmosphere.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:55):**  There are ways that can warm the planet and there are ways that it can cool the planet.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:00):**  And because it's so complicated, it's going back and forth between three different phases,  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:05):**  there's a ton of energy in each of those transitions and phases, and so it was too difficult to model.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:12):**  And so the first scientists looking at climate change just assumed that that was all neutral  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:18):**  and that carbon was this big regulator of our climate.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:22):**  I think that that's totally false.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:25):**  So we have on one side, we have climate change, which is this huge thing that's going to destroy us all,  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:31):**  that we don't really have anything that we can do about,  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:34):**  which now I actually think that that's a symptom of the severe water cycle disturbance that we're having.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:41):**  We can have a very real impact in that severe water cycle disturbance.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:46):**  And it's something that is not invisible, where this molecule that none of us can see is slowly healing.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:53):**  That none of us can see is slowly heating up the earth more and more.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:57):**  This is whether people have clean water to drink.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:00):**  This is whether your animals have water to survive.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:03):**  This is whether your crops have water to grow.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:06):**  And so it's very tangible and actionable.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:08):**  And so I think we could go so far as to say if we actually want to address climate change,  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:13):**  we can't do it without addressing the water cycle.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:16):**  When you have less water within the landscape, you're going to have less life within the landscape,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:23):**  which means you're going to have less carbon sequestration,  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:26):**  which means you're naturally going to have higher CO2 levels,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:30):**  which actually increase the rate of growth in the plants.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:34):**  And so it wants to balance itself out.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:37):**  If we just stopped disturbing the water cycle, it would rebalance itself.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:43):**  I think the biggest barrier is awareness.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:47):**  People just don't know that this is possible.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:50):**  I run into so many people and explain what I do, and almost always they love it and they think it's great  
**[0:08:57-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:57):**  and they think, oh, why aren't we doing this everywhere?  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:59):**  And it's just because people don't know that it's possible.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:04):**  There is a dire need to rewrite natural resource policy management.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:10):**  Dire, dire, dire.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:12):**  I can't tell you how often the things that I want to do are illegal  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:18):**  and they're for a benefit of the immediate property and all the neighbors.

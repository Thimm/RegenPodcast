**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:14):**  Why are small and medium CPG, consumer packaged goods companies so important for the regen  
**[0:00:19-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:19):**  transition?  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:20):**  They touch all the parts of the food web.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:22):**  They source from farmers.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:23):**  They have processing facilities or co-packing facilities.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:26):**  They interact with large distributors and supermarkets and they interact with consumers.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:30):**  And in all of these relationships they can nudge and disrupt for regeneration.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:35):**  But maybe most importantly, they are nimble and can turn a company around in a matter  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:38):**  of months or years as we learn in the interview today.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:41):**  Plus why we should focus on regeneratively disrupting meat and dairy and not waste too  
**[0:00:46-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:46):**  much time on the very crowded plant-based space.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:49):**  The real innovation is happening and has to happen in animal protein.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:59):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:01:03):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:01:08):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:01:13):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:01:18):**  Try my focus on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:01:23):**  have their roots in how we treat our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:01:28):**  and consume.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:01:29):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:01:33):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:08):**  Today we dive deep into the food side of things with the founder and CEO of Noob.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:12):**  Welcome Rafaela.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:13):**  Hi, thanks.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:14):**  Good to be here.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:17):**  So to start with the personal question we always start with, how did you end up focusing  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:22):**  so much on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:25):**  Actually this started, well I started the company five years ago but looking on regeneration  
**[0:02:32-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:32):**  was only two and a half years ago when my twin girls were born and it was six months  
**[0:02:41-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:41):**  before COVID hit and I live in Rio and my parents farm are in Minas Gerais and when  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:48):**  COVID hit we went back to the farm, me, my husband, my two kids and my dog in the car  
**[0:02:54-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:54):**  and it's a 12-hour drive and while we were driving back to the farm we could see the  
**[0:03:02-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:03:02):**  difference from the Atlantic forest to Brazilian savannah and how agribusiness impact the landscape  
**[0:03:12-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:03:12):**  that I used to see since I was little and when I got in the farm and I had these two  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:03:19):**  kids of six months old and I was running a food company, I started questioning myself  
**[0:03:24-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:03:24):**  the impacts of the company that I was creating, the future of the kids and I decided to investigate  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:03:31):**  how the impacts of the system and I remember the first number that I saw was Fowl's report  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:03:36):**  from 2014 saying that if we still do things like we do we only have 60 harvests left,  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:03:43):**  I know that that's a statement that has a lot of discussion nowadays but that was the  
**[0:03:49-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:03:49):**  first time that I saw how broken the food system is and that we need to fix in some  
**[0:03:57-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:03:57):**  way and back then all of my products used dairy ingredients and back then the only solution  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:04):**  was to go plant-based and I was so like it didn't make any sense for me because cheese  
**[0:04:10-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:10):**  bread started in the 18th century and it wasn't common for me to think of the recipe as a  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:20):**  plant-based so I was confused and trying to find a way and I saw Kiss the Ground and I  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:27):**  learned about regenerative agriculture and that's where it all started.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:33):**  And let's unpack a bit, you mentioned just like that in passing cheese bread which is  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:37):**  the foundation of your company for anybody that doesn't know what cheese bread, I mean  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:41):**  you can make an imagination but describe to us what is cheese bread, what is the cheese  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:46):**  bread you're selling and what is cheese bread mostly in Brazil?  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:49):**  Yeah have you ever tried cheese bread?  
**[0:04:51-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:51):**  I haven't no.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:52):**  Oh my god okay.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:53):**  So I'm looking for a visual description as we're in Audi obviously like this is, we're  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:05:00):**  recording this on Monday morning very early for you so what would a cheese bread look  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:05:05):**  like, how does it smell, what does it taste?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:05:08):**  I just ate some today in the morning, I just baked some but cheese bread is for Brazilians  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:05:15):**  sort of like croissant as in France or like bacon in the US is the number one bakery consumed  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:05:22):**  in Brazil and it was created in the 18th century.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:05:27):**  Actually the history behind it it's so interesting and I think that a lot about regeneration  
**[0:05:34-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:05:34):**  we don't talk so much about cultural impact and you know how cuisine is founded and how  
**[0:05:43-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:05:43):**  it was created and the needs for us to preserve old recipes but and that's why I found it  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:05:52):**  cheese bread history so interesting because it was created in the 18th century probably  
**[0:05:57-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:05:57):**  by a woman slave and she, we used to eat bread with wet that came from Portugal and the quality  
**[0:06:07-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:06:07):**  was really bad and we would eat, we would pick eggs and cheese and milk and some sort  
**[0:06:15-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:06:15):**  of fat in the farm and mix it all with wet and make a bread and at some point some woman  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:06:23):**  decided to leave the wet out of the equation and put the base of indigenous cuisine that  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:06:29):**  is tapioca that's manioc so she used...  
**[0:06:34-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:06:34):**  So switch the grain, the imported grain or wheat for an indigenous substance and then  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:06:42):**  it became what it is now.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:06:45):**  Yeah and so this is so unique because you know it took what it was here before Brazil  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:06:52):**  was colonized by Portugal it was you know everyone was eating manioc it's a root that's  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:06:58):**  originally from the rainforest and that's what you know what gets the flower the tapioca  
**[0:07:04-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:07:04):**  flower the yucca flower and that's what cheese bread is it's yucca powder, eggs, cheese,  
**[0:07:13-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:07:13):**  milk, butter, salt, it's so simple it's clean label and yeah it's a huge market in Brazil.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:07:23):**  And you decided to set up a company focusing on that and then how different let's say is  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:07:29):**  the cheese bread now compared to five years ago when you started?  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:07:33):**  Like you said they've been only on a journey for two and a half years I think that's quite  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:07:36):**  a lot honestly I think many many people arrived a lot later and but in that journey of two  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:07:42):**  and a half years what what has changed in in the company a lot of things obviously but  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:07:47):**  in the cheese bread itself like would we if we compared it to would we recognize huge  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:07:50):**  differences if we look them next to each other?  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:07:54):**  Not really the the recipe stays the same and that's one of the things that we do at NU  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:08:00):**  if we open our all of our recipes just because you know if you want to do a recipe in whatever  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:08:07):**  you are you can do it so if you go online you have the ingredients and the ingredients  
**[0:08:12-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:08:12):**  didn't change we used to use smallholder farmers ingredient and just you know raw milk cheese  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:08:20):**  and all this super neat products but what changed was the way that we do it that changed  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:08:27):**  a lot because we used to produce in a co-packer and when I was investigating this impact of  
**[0:08:34-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:08:34):**  the food system you know in the future I saw that a lot of startups and food techs they  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:08:42):**  decentralized the whole operations just because it's more it's easy that way so the negative  
**[0:08:48-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:08:48):**  focus on scaling up and to me when I found you know the the impact that we make producing  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:08:55):**  these products I saw that we needed to scale deep and that's when we decided to create  
**[0:09:02-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:02):**  our own factory and to look at this made at the source value chain and see how we can  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:10):**  go to smallholder farmers and bring knowledge of regenerative agriculture and agroforestry  
**[0:09:16-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:16):**  and just pivot the model to try to bring impact to the whole chain so that's what changed  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:24):**  but the product itself didn't change and we launched other products also after that.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:29):**  Yeah let's unpack them in a second but just for the cheese bread how big is a normal cheese  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:35):**  bread is it like the size of a croissant the size of a bagel is it bigger or smaller and  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:39):**  how do you eat it is it mostly breakfast?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:40):**  Well it has a lot of it's a lot no it's different sizes but it's smaller it's sort of like well  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:48):**  you can see me but people can't see me but it's that big.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:50):**  Like a coin a big coin.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:52):**  Yeah a little yeah a little bit bigger and you bake and it's like a ball a little ball  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:58):**  like cheese they say cheese rolls in US as well and you bake it in the morning so you  
**[0:10:03-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:10:03):**  can do in your air fryer or in your oven I mean just bake it for 15 minutes and it's  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:10:10):**  ready and here people in Brazil eat obviously at breakfast but we sell to a lot of restaurants  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:10:16):**  that eat that put it in their entrées and hotels if you go to any hotel in Brazil you're  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:10:22):**  gonna have cheese bread in breakfast so yeah it's very spread.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:10:29):**  And when did you decide to launch products alongside that was it before or let's say  
**[0:10:34-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:10:34):**  after beginning of pandemic or your regenerative journey started?  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:10:41):**  It was after so cheese bread if you go to a supermarket here in Brazil you're gonna  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:10:46):**  have a frozen sector of cheese bread as big as pizza for instance so it's really big.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:10:53):**  It's almost 2 billion reais market in Brazil.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:10:59):**  When you look at cheese bread what happened and that's one of the reason that I found  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:11:02):**  the company was that the cheese bread that was created in the 18th century and that you  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:11:08):**  can find in the farms are not the ones that you're finding obviously in the supermarket  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:11:12):**  because companies ultra industrialize the product and sometimes they don't even have  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:11:17):**  cheese even though they are called cheese bread in Portuguese they're called pão de  
**[0:11:22-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:11:22):**  queijo so it's all like yeah it's the same translation so that was the hint that I had  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:11:30):**  to bring back this recipe to consumers and then after a while in the supermarket and  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:11:36):**  we're today in the biggest retails in Brazil we saw that only with one product we couldn't  
**[0:11:43-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:11:43):**  deliver all change and we would we wouldn't be so relevant to to retails as if we had  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:11:51):**  different products and then we looked at Manioc and and there is this interesting book from  
**[0:11:58-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:11:58):**  Alex Atala he's I think the biggest chef today in Brazil and he launched this he wrote this  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:12:05):**  book called Manioc and if you're interested in knowing about Manioc it's amazing book  
**[0:12:10-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:12:10):**  and he goes to indigenous villages in the rainforest and see how many sub products you  
**[0:12:17-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:12:17):**  can have from Manioc so you can have something to drink you can have something to have sweets  
**[0:12:25-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:12:25):**  on it or salt just it's so wild and naturally gluten-free so we started developing other  
**[0:12:33-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:12:33):**  products with the same base as is in Yucca so we launched tapioca sticks that's only  
**[0:12:41-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:12:41):**  three ingredients tapioca cheese and milk and now we launched five skews of gluten-free  
**[0:12:49-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:12:49):**  tapioca pizza and this line was created after we put in these three fillers on regenerating  
**[0:12:58-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:12:58):**  SMEs of and CPG brands that's the made at the source the production you know the factory  
**[0:13:06-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:13:06):**  and product pipeline because product pipeline if you think when when you if you put regeneration  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:13:13):**  in front of any product launch you just you know there is a wheel that you pull virtuous  
**[0:13:19-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:13:19):**  wheel and that's what we did in the last launch and in this tapioca has obviously been indigenous  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:13:28):**  has been in Brazil forever why is it such a interesting plant let's say from I mean  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:13:33):**  from the food perspective there are a million different ways you can consume it and from  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:13:37):**  a soil perspective why is it an interesting one that you said okay we need this in more  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:13:43):**  in more products we need to get closer to this this specific plant I guess that we are  
**[0:13:49-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:13:49):**  now doing that we did a project with to find out how we can put many arc and other savannah  
**[0:13:59-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:13:59):**  trees in the same agroforestry and see how this this route can increase soil and and  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:14:10):**  you know work in the ecosystem but what we see today that is since it's naturally from  
**[0:14:16-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:14:16):**  Brazil and it's so vast and there's so many people using and producing and obviously it's  
**[0:14:24-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:14:24):**  originally from the rainforest but it's all over all around Brazil we just want to use  
**[0:14:31-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:14:31):**  what's here what's local and see because today every production that we see here from many  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:14:40):**  of its monoculture we don't have it implemented in agroforestry systems so we don't know  
**[0:14:45-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:14:45):**  how it's going to be after we're doing the project with Prisateja and that's what we  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:14:53):**  want to find out what are the inputs that we have compared to wheat for instance we  
**[0:14:58-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:14:58):**  don't have that number today and I mean there are so many different ways to take it but  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:15:05):**  how how is the consumer responded like we we've often heard I mean it's already tricky  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:15:11):**  to to put organic on let me most people don't really know what what's behind the labels  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:15:17):**  and then when you take it to a whole new level which is regenerative what have you done on  
**[0:15:21-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:15:21):**  like packaging on communication or maybe nothing you just go for the taste and what has been  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:15:29):**  that that communication journey or that that conversation journey with your with your consumers  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:15:35):**  on this journey I'm laughing because regeneration it's a it's a tricky word right people just  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:15:41):**  don't know how to pronounce it it's just it's it's not so spread here in Brazil and that's  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:15:46):**  why it was so interesting to find your podcast and this movement going around the world but  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:15:52):**  in Brazil it's not so consumers don't know there are people working in food business  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:15:58):**  that know about regeneration obviously but the consumers don't know about it so we don't  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:16:02):**  put regeneration in the in the packaging what we did was we're carbon neutral today so we  
**[0:16:09-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:16:09):**  put it the carbon footprint and the in the product and some other stamps that defines  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:16:18):**  all this circular economy and the fact that we are woman-owned and the fact that we are  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:16:24):**  carbon neutral and you're using small folder farmers ingredients but regeneration as a  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:16:29):**  word we don't put it in the in the packaging just because it's sort of talking about yoga  
**[0:16:35-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:16:35):**  a year before yoga is mainstream and everybody looks at you like what yeah they don't they  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:16:43):**  don't see I mean even though in Brazil it seems like especially in the agroforestry  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:16:49):**  side of things it's extremely developed compared to to other places there's so much happening  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:16:55):**  on centropic agroforestry and agroforestry in general of course there's so much happening  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:16:59):**  on the agri business on the other side as well yeah and but there's there seems to be  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:17:04):**  quite a bit happening there so if you're like in terms of sourcing in terms of talking to  
**[0:17:09-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:17:09):**  people in the business in the food business do you see there an interest in in these topics  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:17:16):**  do you see there is it easy to find your peers and people to work with and to to source and  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:17:22):**  to to build these products at the end because at the end of the day you're making things  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:17:26):**  that end up on the supermarket shelves of the biggest supermarkets in Brazil yeah no  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:17:31):**  it's not so easy well you may have this impression that things are going here in Brazil in terms  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:17:37):**  of you know agroforestry and centropic movements because you have some good players but it's  
**[0:17:42-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:17:42):**  not you know just commodity and it's just so huge here and obviously the the government  
**[0:17:50-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:17:50):**  doesn't put any energy whatsoever in regeneration so it's a bubble and what we did was to find  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:17:58):**  these peers as you've said and the people that were working in the field and one of  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:18:02):**  our counselors that's in our board of advisors it's from Fazenda da Toca do you know their  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:18:08):**  work I know their work we have never been obviously because I've never been to Brazil  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:18:13):**  but also I haven't interviewed them but we interviewed a few people I think that have  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:18:16):**  worked there and just yeah all of them yeah but just describe for the people that didn't  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:18:22):**  listen to that what what is Fazenda da Toca? Fazenda da Toca is from so there is this big  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:18:28):**  chain in Brazil called Pão de Açúcar it's the second biggest one in Brazil after Carrefour  
**[0:18:35-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:18:35):**  and the founder's son used to be a pilot actually from the Formula One how to call that the  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:18:45):**  car race car driver yeah yeah Formula One race car driver yeah and he left everything  
**[0:18:50-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:18:50):**  and just bought this farm and started working with regeneration and now they are the biggest  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:18:57):**  ag producer in Brazil and they also started working with grains so they're the biggest  
**[0:19:04-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:19:04):**  corn organic with resoma right with resoma agro it's in the in the farm and now recently  
**[0:19:12-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:19:12):**  two years ago one year ago they they also incorporated a no carbon company called no  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:19:20):**  carbon milk no carbon cheese so it's a huge farm working in different fields and their  
**[0:19:26-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:19:26):**  CEO is in our board of advisors just because I watched him talking in this webinar and  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:19:34):**  I was like I need to you know understand what you're doing because there's not a lot of  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:19:38):**  people doing this in Brazil and now he's in our board of advisors so it's pretty cool  
**[0:19:43-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:19:43):**  and in in the region that we are at 80 percent of our suppliers come from 40 kilometers from  
**[0:19:52-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:19:52):**  the factory so we are very local and when we started building the factory in the same  
**[0:19:59-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:19:59):**  time we were looking for small other farmers that had this mindset and there is there was  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:20:06):**  zero no one in the surroundings and this is a big agribusiness area no one was looking  
**[0:20:13-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:20:13):**  at agroforestry or having these principles and so we started going to the government  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:20:20):**  and to different institutions to find resources to go to at least one smallholder farmer and  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:20:27):**  do him as a living lab for others to see what he's doing and we were funded by the international  
**[0:20:33-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:20:33):**  development bank to do this the shift from one one farm that'll do raw milk cheese should  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:20:43):**  do a carbon neutral raw milk cheese so we're implementing this project powered by the international  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:20:49):**  development bank but this is just something that you need to go through different areas  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:20:55):**  just because we're a small company we don't have the resources needed to educate and do  
**[0:20:59-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:20:59):**  workshops but we're we're a voice now in the region so much and and with that one farm  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:21:08):**  let's say in transition now is the interest shifting and of course with your interest  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:21:12):**  to to buy these ingredients like there isn't there is an off-taker there's a buyer for  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:21:16):**  this it's not that you're you're pushing them to to change to something and and then there's  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:21:21):**  nobody to to buy anything is is it shifting the conversation over the last like as there  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:21:27):**  as you see that something concrete is is happening is there something something shifting or is  
**[0:21:32-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:21:32):**  it still pushing pushing up the hill no it is from two years to now and obviously after  
**[0:21:40-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:21:40):**  esg became big with big food companies there is a need for suppliers and you see big big  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:21:50):**  companies like danone or uni level or nestle they're looking for this smallholder farmers  
**[0:21:56-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:21:56):**  that does any of this practices and at the last food summit we were part of this program  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:22:07):**  powered by Rockefeller foundation and i don't know if you heard of it it's called game changers  
**[0:22:12-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:22:12):**  lab did you did you hear anything about it yeah heard about it but tell me what it is  
**[0:22:19-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:22:19):**  because yeah it was an interesting topic so they from for the food summit the idio and  
**[0:22:27-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:22:27):**  Rockefeller foundation and a lot of different institutions came up with this sort of accelerated  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:22:35):**  where they divided into four the 24 cohorts and my cohort was to scale the forestry was  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:22:42):**  to find a solution to scale agroforestry and we had people from africa europe here in brazil  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:22:48):**  so different people working this project for six months and we came up with this idea called  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:22:55):**  agropedia where a smallholder farmer and since i'm from the farm my parents are from the  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:23:01):**  farm i know the reality of a Brazilian smallholder farmer he doesn't have the resources to do  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:23:05):**  this shift so agropedia it's a it's an online resource where he goes and see you know i  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:23:12):**  have a farm and this this is the size of the farm what's the marketplace you know like  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:23:19):**  who who's gonna buy for me what's what's the noni wants what nestle wants or what this  
**[0:23:25-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:23:25):**  big companies want and what are they willing to pay because there is a premium price for  
**[0:23:33-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:23:33):**  this product and so yeah so agropedia is coming we're we also were funded and we're just developing  
**[0:23:40-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:23:40):**  the platform to do some resource to give to some smallholder farmers some resources to  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:23:48):**  do this shift but it's a work in progress i mean it's just it takes long it's gonna  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:23:54):**  be a long journey and what kind of products like what products do you think let's say  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:24:01):**  you had a clean slate you can develop any product you you wanted i mean the resources  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:24:06):**  are there what would you develop to unlock that potential of agroforestry like what would  
**[0:24:10-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:24:10):**  be needed to to really pull instead of push maybe um yeah there is this number that i  
**[0:24:18-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:24:18):**  always oftenly think that we can eat 31 000 different plants and 43 of all we eat comes  
**[0:24:28-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:24:28):**  from corn wheat and soy i mean it's just it we narrow down so much the possibilities that  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:24:37):**  we have so um here in brazil obviously there are the the superfood ingredients from the  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:24:43):**  rainforest but savannah itself it's and beyond that we are working in the factory it's that  
**[0:24:50-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:24:50):**  um there's so many nuts and fruits and you know acai that's so famous in brazil it's  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:24:57):**  a super ingredient but you have many as a root um you have coffee here in brazil pretty  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:25:03):**  big and there's just so many resources and in my company what we're trying to do is to  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:25:08):**  put livestock um in the equation because i feel that there are a lot of people working  
**[0:25:14-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:25:14):**  with plant-based um products and um we see from faust forecast that the consumption from  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:25:23):**  meat and dairy products are going to increase at least we're going to increase at least  
**[0:25:27-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:25:27):**  in 50 percent till 2050 so we need to find ways to put you know the cow in the equation  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:25:35):**  so to me i'm more interested in understanding how we can work with dairy products in a regenerative  
**[0:25:39-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:25:39):**  perspective and obviously using um other resources such as many to create these amazing tasty  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:25:48):**  products yeah do you see that i mean that is there a pushback as well in in brazil  
**[0:25:54-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:25:54):**  on um let's say the animal animal agriculture side and and your story or your push there  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:03):**  to say let's see how we use the cow and not necessarily um and take that completely out  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:08):**  of the equation is that something that's been happening there because i see it globally  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:12):**  like it's immediately let's get rid of all animals because we need to be plant-based  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:16):**  and um often forgetting that like fertilization has to come from somewhere it's either from  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:21):**  gas or from very very large scale compost facilities which we need a lot of time and  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:26):**  space or from animals and and i mean we know the the issues with gas especially i mean  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:32):**  not only environmental but also political as we see in the last last months like is  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:36):**  that discussion happening in brazil as well like what or is it is it more like the animal  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:41):**  is is still more part of the the agriculture system or the future system of mostly i mean  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:47):**  there's always city people that never visit their farm let's say let's get rid of the  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:50):**  animals they saw a few documentaries and think how agriculture work works but how is that  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:55):**  discussion when you say i want the animal to be part of the the system is that you get  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:59):**  pushback for that or no um yeah so brazil has more cows than people can you imagine  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:27:05):**  that we're a huge player currently in a country i mean the netherlands slaughters which is  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:27:11):**  not a good thing at all 1.2 billion chickens a year so i mean there are places which you  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:27:16):**  would be surprised about the amount of animals um yeah but okay so the cow is a fundamental  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:27:21):**  it's a strong part of the the culture it's a strong part and we export a lot a lot of  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:27:26):**  it but we consume a lot of meat in brazil as well it's part of our cuisine and uh our  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:27:32):**  plant base is it's rising especially in food tags and startups and venture capitals are  
**[0:27:38-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:27:38):**  looking for it and i think it's a legit the legit the legit legit legit it's legit it's  
**[0:27:47-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:27:47):**  legit um and i think it's uh yeah but um i think that we have a huge we're missing out  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:27:57):**  a huge opportunity to understand how we can use dairy products in a regenerative way and  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:28:04):**  we don't see a lot of venture capitals investing in this in brazil and i just i a couple months  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:28:09):**  ago i saw that bill gates invested in a no carbon milk and everyone was like you know  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:28:15):**  so oh my god you need to be investing in plant based and this is not the solution but we  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:28:20):**  see that you know and this is one of the books that i'm reading uh defending beef have ever  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:28:26):**  uh seen this book yeah we had we had her arm actually nicolette in their show notes uh  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:28:31):**  around christmas last year it's it's very interesting it's so interesting in terms of  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:28:37):**  data and and where a lot of these reports come from and and how they are let's say statistical  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:28:43):**  not not statistically not really well like well founded and never been never retracted  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:28:49):**  and these numbers stay out there like 50 of emissions come from livestock which is somebody  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:28:54):**  once said it somewhere it's completely nonsense but it stays there forever in in the general  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:29:00):**  mindset so yeah um i think there's so you're saying there's a huge opportunity there to  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:29:06):**  look at dairy which is true i don't hear anybody or very few people talk about let's let's  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:29:11):**  just let's um disrupt dairy it's usually then plant-based instead of using or let's disrupt  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:29:17):**  dairy with dairy yeah and see how to do that and what what are examples of that like what  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:29:21):**  are what are you working on or working with that is really fundamentally different from  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:29:26):**  the dairy industry we now see which is mostly inside feeding a lot of soy and corn even  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:29:31):**  even though sometimes organic but still that i mean there are a lot of questions to be  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:29:34):**  asked and then we get a dairy product out of there that yeah we can ask a lot of questions  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:29:38):**  about um what what is the dairy you're you're envisioning or working with um yeah so we work  
**[0:29:45-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:29:45):**  with um as small holder farmers that have uh up near 50 hectares farm so they're not big so it's  
**[0:29:56-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:29:56):**  good in terms of how you can implement um different systems and crop rotations and you know it's  
**[0:30:05-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:30:05):**  easier than big lands but at the same time they don't know about this resources and that's the key  
**[0:30:12-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:30:12):**  um issue that we're seeing how we can bring the message to these farmers so we're using this  
**[0:30:19-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:30:19):**  um different institutions to support us so government the ministry of agriculture environment  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:30:27):**  and this different project such as the one that i've mentioned with the international development  
**[0:30:32-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:30:32):**  bank but we are also using starting different peers other peers that are working with uh methane  
**[0:30:39-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:30:39):**  and how um you know cow feed can decrease methane emissions and how we can the crop rotation can  
**[0:30:48-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:30:48):**  sequestrate carbon and decrease also gas emissions and um the taste of the product also changes a lot  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:30:56):**  and that's one of the key things yeah um so how did it change since you i mean how how would you  
**[0:31:02-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:31:02):**  again we're we're an audio program but like how does the taste changes when the milk changes or  
**[0:31:09-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:31:09):**  what the cow ate and how the cow ate this is so and this is so we're so uh we need to develop so  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:31:17):**  much in terms of how we understand food because when you go to a supermarket when you go to a  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:31:22):**  shop you go to a restaurant you know that today you're going to have your favorite favorite plate  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:31:26):**  and tomorrow it might taste different right have ever had this experience where you go to a  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:31:32):**  restaurant and like it's like the difference more i don't know um you just know that you expect that  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:31:39):**  from a restaurant but when you go to the supermarket and you get a package you as a consumer  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:31:46):**  um have this knowledge that you're gonna have the same thing and the same you know taste over and  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:31:51):**  over again because that's how food industry developed our our brain i mean if you eat a  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:31:58):**  mcdonald's here in brazil another one in japan it's gonna have the same taste because everything  
**[0:32:02-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:32:02):**  is ultra industrialized and this is something that we are putting in the package this is a natural  
**[0:32:09-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:32:09):**  you know with artisan ingredients and handcrafted ingredients and it's gonna taste the same because  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:32:16):**  it's not gonna taste the same because it's natural and you know naturally it's not gonna taste the  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:32:21):**  same and that's one of the things that we see that from different farms and we buy from different  
**[0:32:26-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:32:26):**  farms the cheese um they just taste different and we have uh in the factory you have a room a cheese  
**[0:32:33-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:32:33):**  room and we say that they hear country music because you know the wines in in argentina or  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:32:40):**  in france they hear like classical yeah like classic music um we hear country music but just  
**[0:32:46-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:32:46):**  just fun fact but um we see difference from different uh farms and it just tastes better  
**[0:32:53-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:32:53):**  i don't know how we we haven't put it um any lab data on it but it tastes better  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:02):**  do you ever get complaints like people saying yeah but this wasn't like this package is different  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:08):**  than that one oh yeah did you ever get comments on that like yeah and then what do you respond and  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:13):**  the color is also different and i'm like okay so the chicken put in some eggs that has more orange  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:20):**  color in it this season and you know that's just gonna happen and we don't like butter changes  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:25):**  color i had a conversation last week with someone and said yeah of course during the season butter  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:30):**  change it if you have grass fat butter or grass fat cows that the butter changes color and for sure  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:35):**  changes fat content depending on the pasture and they never thought about it you could see the  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:40):**  light bulbs going on um like oh my god it's actually it's an alive product and it changes and  
**[0:33:46-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:46):**  it yeah it depends on the season etc exactly and like is that i mean i can't imagine that your  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:54):**  customers that are buying these products are off put by that because otherwise they would be going  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:59):**  for the industrialized one but how do you respond to that as a customer service like yeah  
**[0:34:02-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:34:02):**  this is this is nature welcome welcome to the season or pictures yeah we have this um we have  
**[0:34:09-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:34:09):**  this new ladder called newa and we started eight months ago after we were deep diving in the  
**[0:34:17-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:34:17):**  regeneration and we just had this mission to inform consumer that everything changes and it's  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:34:25):**  so neat i'm gonna send it to it's in portuguese though but it's so neat we have a journalist  
**[0:34:29-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:34:29):**  that goes and interview chefs and go to farmers and interview them to see what's in the season  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:34:36):**  just i think that this is a message that we want to educate consumers to understand that nature  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:34:41):**  doesn't it's not in their disposal just because you know they want to it's not because they want  
**[0:34:46-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:34:46):**  to eat avocado every month that they should be eating because it's no driving overseas this  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:34:53):**  avocado and doesn't make any sense and that's why um the first question that you've asked that's why  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:34:58):**  i think that everything should be local we need to be eating as much as we can pick things that  
**[0:35:04-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:35:04):**  are produced here and in the seasons and respecting nature when you see that enormous attention that  
**[0:35:13-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:35:13):**  let's say the the industrialized plant-based meats get or plant-based dairy and and the investors  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:35:20):**  are all um it seems really it seems really hyped or like the amount of attention going in that  
**[0:35:25-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:35:25):**  space what would you tell a room full of investors about the the excitement or the potential of  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:35:32):**  regenerative dairy and regenerative cheese and regenerative beef etc or meat in general or  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:35:37):**  proteins like what would you um say to a group like imagine we're in in a in a live theater and  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:35:43):**  it's a room full of investors and you've convinced them about okay nature is extremely important  
**[0:35:47-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:35:47):**  or extremely fundamental they will walk out to at the end of the evening and and what would you tell  
**[0:35:54-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:35:54):**  them obviously without giving investment advice but where would they start looking more where  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:35:57):**  would they start um digging a bit deeper or where where to start as an investor in this space because  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:36:04):**  it's so easy to join the hype on the left let's say on the right whatever side you choose but the  
**[0:36:08-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:36:08):**  hype that is going okay we just have to to build a lot of huge factories with fermentation fats  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:36:14):**  etc and and all these slides look amazing and the everything just goes up and up and up and the  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:36:19):**  rounds seem to to never end and and then we're sort of in the other side saying yeah but actually  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:36:24):**  there there might be another way and there might be a different way like how do we what would you  
**[0:36:28-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:36:28):**  tell them if investors are interested to explore further i would say that just look at the numbers  
**[0:36:37-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:36:37):**  and what size you know how big is dairy products compared to plant-based how big is meat products  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:36:44):**  compared compared to plant-based it's gonna only i know that plant-based is going to increase but  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:36:49):**  meat consumption and dairy consumption it's also going to increase and these are the biggest sales  
**[0:36:54-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:36:54):**  in the supermarket i mean i have one of our distributors um he is he he uh he sells 400  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:37:02):**  million reais per year and it's huge and 50% of everything that he sells it's meat  
**[0:37:10-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:37:10):**  so people are eating meat it's part of their daily routine they you know use butter in every  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:37:17):**  morning and they are eating cheese every morning so um i feel they're missing out an opportunity  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:37:23):**  to go to the market that it's already developed it's already inherent in every cuisine every show  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:37:29):**  and there is a lot of people in the plant base but few people in dairy looking at dairy ingredients  
**[0:37:36-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:37:36):**  and and meat itself and i feel that we're just missing this opportunity to find you know how  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:37:43):**  you can incorporate regeneration um in the products they're already selling and that they're in the  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:37:49):**  the biggest sales actually um in the retail so i would just look for this tradition and and  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:37:55):**  people usually say oh you you sell cheese bread this is not there's no innovation there is no  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:38:01):**  technology obviously there's a lot of technology involved um you know from a dairy perspective but  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:38:07):**  also from the many of that's the root and that's going to come the dairies uh up in it and we're  
**[0:38:13-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:38:13):**  going to put the product up but um how many technology you can unfold from you know understanding  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:38:22):**  maniac as a superfood ingredient then you can have a pasta or you can have a flower you can have so  
**[0:38:27-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:38:27):**  many other ingredients and bake it with dairy products that's what we are trying to do i think  
**[0:38:34-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:38:34):**  it's a very interesting point i mean there's an enormous amount of innovation happening and it  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:38:40):**  needs to happen which involves a lot of technology but going to the the sector that is already  
**[0:38:45-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:38:45):**  developed and that that needs a massive shift i mean there's no there's no question about it but  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:38:54):**  it's not going to disappear tomorrow nor in 10 years even if we completely are disrupted by any  
**[0:38:59-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:38:59):**  cellular ag etc it's just it won't i don't think it won't uh disappear that quickly um and so we  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:06):**  if we like it or not we need to change that sector just as we if we like it or not in general we need  
**[0:39:11-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:11):**  to change agriculture even if tomorrow we we invent the the best modular nuclear fusion machine  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:18):**  that we can scale really really quickly and we get our fossil fuel in in a second or we scale  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:22):**  solar extremely quickly we still have to change agriculture if we like it and and so it's uh it's  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:28):**  a shame that it's but it's neglected which should be very exciting for investors and other people in  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:33):**  the space because there are not so many others which means you can make a huge difference and  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:37):**  you can play a huge role if you want to um because yeah it's it's literally as you were sort of  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:43):**  referring to as calling in the desert like you were uh you were quite lonely in that place maybe  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:48):**  still are partly that is changing but it's still there is there's a lot of room for other innovation  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:53):**  and there's a lot of room for investments and there's a lot of room for technology and people  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:57):**  like oh yeah let's go back to how it was a hundred or two hundred years ago i think they they really  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:40:02):**  they really need to visit the farm and see the potential of drones of certain light equipment  
**[0:40:08-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:40:08):**  new robotics of virtual fencing of processing on the spot um or much more local and to keep all  
**[0:40:16-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:40:16):**  this freshness of um obviously the dna dna sequencing following bio acoustics i mean there's so much  
**[0:40:24-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:40:24):**  i heard somebody's talking about an ai um an ai use case to help farmers incorporate cover crops  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:40:32):**  um and i mean there there's a lot on the technology side to do there but i think it's a very good  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:40:36):**  message let go where the opportunity is and this is this is a blue ocean basically so what would  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:40:41):**  you do if you would be an investor let's say you you're not running new because you cannot both run  
**[0:40:46-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:40:46):**  a company and put a lot of money to work and have twins and do a gazillion other things for sure but  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:40:52):**  if you had to put let's say a billion dollars to work um could be in brazil could be anywhere else  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:40:57):**  what would you focus on like what would be the main would it be really on the food company side  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:41:02):**  would it be on technology side would it be on a transition finance all of the above but what  
**[0:41:08-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:41:08):**  was your your main where would you start i'm very interested in understanding the power of  
**[0:41:15-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:41:15):**  smes they're looking up different ways to produce products so um there is this group called the good  
**[0:41:22-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:41:22):**  food hub that i'm involved in it was created from for from me and after the food summit and it's a  
**[0:41:31-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:41:31):**  hub where there are a lot of smes around the world we i we won the the prize for united nations 50  
**[0:41:38-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:41:38):**  best small business and we are all together and it's just so interesting to see this smes working  
**[0:41:44-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:41:44):**  in different fields to fix the broken food system so i would definitely look at this small startups  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:41:51):**  that are in different areas just trying to understand how you can produce products and  
**[0:41:56-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:41:56):**  in a nature positive way and not just decentralizing the whole operation because that's  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:42:03):**  just something that when you go to the supermarket and you see everything now all this packaging this  
**[0:42:09-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:42:09):**  is agribusiness you know agribusiness is a it's inside all of those packaging so if you don't see  
**[0:42:17-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:42:17):**  if you don't look if smes don't look how they are impacting the whole system um who's going to do  
**[0:42:24-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:42:24):**  that you know big corporations are having their um their plans for 2040 2050 but smes can shift  
**[0:42:32-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:42:32):**  now and we did that in two years we shifted the whole model so i would definitely look at smes  
**[0:42:39-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:42:39):**  around the world and um they're usually entrepreneurs passionate about you know  
**[0:42:46-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:42:46):**  their clematarians and they're passionate about regeneration and and regenerating also  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:42:53):**  recipes right that's one of the things that we've mentioned people are not talking so much about  
**[0:42:57-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:42:57):**  um indigenous recipe or grandma recipes or things that were used you used to eat your grandmother  
**[0:43:04-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:04):**  used to eat and you don't find it any longer so i would put some investment in those people  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:12):**  yeah i think it's very interesting that sort of layer i mean we keep it keeps coming back i don't  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:16):**  know over the last six months or so uh with poor light food as well which i will put in the in the  
**[0:43:21-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:21):**  climate neutral or climate positive food companies like this layer which is beyond the farm and and  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:27):**  sort of is that interaction between the farm or the land and our consumer or the hospital that  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:33):**  buys it or the restaurant i mean but there is a layer in between because many many products  
**[0:43:38-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:38):**  rightfully so are not going to end up on a farmer's market and we don't buy directly from  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:42):**  the farmer because they have to be processed in a good way and processing is not necessarily an  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:46):**  ugly word but somehow there is a transformation going on there and that layer is so fundamental  
**[0:43:51-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:51):**  and you're saying there's a huge opportunity there but because there are these companies that can  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:57):**  shift if they haven't already done so and they have a lot of space to grow because what you see  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:44:03):**  and i think just asking the question the consumer is ready for for this the consumer wants clean  
**[0:44:08-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:44:08):**  label exactly not every consumer but enough of it to have an interesting business obviously have you  
**[0:44:14-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:44:14):**  seen a shift there as well yes like the last years well there was a research run here in brazil last  
**[0:44:21-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:44:21):**  year and said that 83 of consumers want to buy sustainable products but they don't want to spend  
**[0:44:28-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:44:28):**  more so that's a tricky thing because they want to buy from um you know local producers and obviously  
**[0:44:36-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:44:36):**  with impact but they don't want to spend more just because inflation is huge here in brazil  
**[0:44:40-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:44:40):**  um but i feel that you we have an opportunity to produce products in a more intelligent way  
**[0:44:46-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:44:46):**  and we saw that when we built the factory i mean it's cheaper to have clean energy to have solar  
**[0:44:53-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:44:53):**  panels it's it's cheaper to storage rainfall rainwater and use it in the in the factory i mean  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:45:00):**  if you bring technology but also sustainability and you can see circular economy principles  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:45:06):**  it's going to be cheaper it doesn't need to be expensive more expensive the product and  
**[0:45:12-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:45:12):**  so there is obviously a shift and i feel that food food tax and and startups it doesn't need  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:45:18):**  to be a food tech but startups that are having cpg brands they work in so many different areas  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:45:24):**  right because they dialogue with farmers because they need to buy the ingredients they dialogue  
**[0:45:29-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:45:29):**  with co-packers or they eat the process that in their own factories they dialogue with consumers  
**[0:45:34-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:45:34):**  the dialogue with retailers i mean there are so many different stakeholders they can change  
**[0:45:41-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:45:41):**  yeah and that's why i'm so um interested in seeing how this this food tax can change  
**[0:45:49-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:45:49):**  perspective perception in different areas so you're arguing that that's the biggest lever we have  
**[0:45:56-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:45:56):**  or leverage point we have are the food companies and especially the small to medium sized ones  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:02):**  because they're still nimble they can shift around in a couple of years or a couple of  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:06):**  months if they're very small and and they can grow quite rapidly and in touch a lot of farmers a lot  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:11):**  of land and a lot of people obviously on the consumer side but also all the other stakeholders  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:16):**  you interact with they will be and maybe at the beginning they're annoyed at this regeneration  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:21):**  piece comes up again or maybe they're like oh they're talking again about recycled rainwater  
**[0:46:25-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:25):**  etc but at some point yeah it becomes almost normal like you're you're definitely opening  
**[0:46:29-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:29):**  a path there which is very tiring but those are very needed yeah and i think that the key point  
**[0:46:37-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:37):**  it's how much can we grow and this was a aha moment that i had a couple of months ago i was  
**[0:46:46-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:46):**  with my husband and we ordered mcdonald's because we're in this business but sometimes you drink  
**[0:46:51-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:51):**  coca-cola or something you know i'm not so rigid and we ordered mcdonald's and we were eating  
**[0:46:57-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:57):**  mcdonald's and we were eating mcdonald's and i thought if new was the size of mcdonald's how  
**[0:47:04-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:47:04):**  how it would be how could that be possible and that's the thing about cpg brands once they grow  
**[0:47:12-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:47:12):**  they can't sustain regeneration that much because you know if i i have a hundred tons uh factory  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:47:19):**  here in brazil but if i go to 10 000 tons per month i'm not gonna have the suppliers local  
**[0:47:24-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:47:24):**  suppliers i'm not i'm gonna export to netherlands and you're gonna eat it and you know um we're  
**[0:47:30-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:47:30):**  just gonna um yeah it's a contradiction so then i thought how can a cpg brand be global  
**[0:47:39-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:47:39):**  and at the same time doesn't harm the ecosystem and the and that's the theory that we're going  
**[0:47:46-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:47:46):**  through and that's why i mentioned that we're going for the first round of investment is  
**[0:47:50-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:47:50):**  that we're expanding but being global but at the same time being local and that's the only way  
**[0:47:57-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:47:57):**  you can't produce here in brazil and export all around the world you need to go to us and see  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:48:03):**  who are the dairy producers who are the egg producers you know how you can find local  
**[0:48:08-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:48:08):**  farmers and smallholder farmers and how can you produce there and then sell it there and go to  
**[0:48:14-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:48:14):**  europe and go to you know um repeat yeah exactly so you can be a global cpg brand um and be a  
**[0:48:23-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:48:23):**  regenerative with a nature positive perspective but you need to be local that's the only way that  
**[0:48:29-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:48:29):**  we found is that what you referred to at the beginning as scaling deeply is that the similar  
**[0:48:35-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:48:35):**  or is that connected to it yes and then how does it look like would it be sort of a collection of  
**[0:48:40-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:48:40):**  global brands under the same principles guiding principles because different would it be different  
**[0:48:46-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:48:46):**  food as well because it's not a different brazilian cheese bread in kentucky because that's  
**[0:48:53-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:48:53):**  yeah i mean yeah it would be a funny a funny thing to eat but it's not part of the culture  
**[0:48:56-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:48:56):**  so you can take the guiding principles and yeah and set up local i wouldn't say versions but like  
**[0:49:04-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:49:04):**  the almost local version but in like the local translated version of what you're building in  
**[0:49:08-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:49:08):**  brazil or building exactly yeah that's exactly what we're doing um we're gonna obviously we  
**[0:49:14-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:49:14):**  don't have many in us um and we're gonna need to import but that's the only ingredient we need to  
**[0:49:20-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:49:20):**  import the rest of ingredients we can find it locally and that's the part of scale deep you  
**[0:49:27-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:49:27):**  need to find local suppliers for your products you can have a co-packer it doesn't need to be  
**[0:49:32-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:49:32):**  you know you don't need to have a factory but you can find local co-packers and um work with  
**[0:49:38-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:49:38):**  the small other farmers and if you reach a state as we've reached here in brazil you can bind that  
**[0:49:44-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:49:44):**  you can build a factory but it doesn't need to be um a factory replica replicable replicable  
**[0:49:53-0:49:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:49:53):**  better word as we are doing here in brazil but we're using brazil as a living lab and that's why  
**[0:49:59-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:49:59):**  the factory is within 40 kilometers from the farmers and that's why we're putting the agroforestry from  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:50:05):**  petaterra we're already doing free range eggs here we need to learn right we need to learn  
**[0:50:12-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:50:12):**  so then we can teach to other farmers and that's the only solution we see to scale the model  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:50:19):**  it should go deep to go from soil to plate that's the thing about cpg you can go from soil to plate  
**[0:50:26-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:50:26):**  two things on that wouldn't it be possible to find a local route that is that so you don't  
**[0:50:33-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:50:33):**  have to import the manioc into some place like what what would it be ideally we would try to find  
**[0:50:39-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:50:39):**  the the local route that that is very unloved but also a superfood and it could be a perfect  
**[0:50:46-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:50:46):**  ingredient not sure if that's possible and second i'm imagining in brazil there's so many biomes in  
**[0:50:50-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:50:50):**  so many different regions that are so different from each other that there is a lot of space to  
**[0:50:56-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:50:56):**  repeat there as well to repeat because brazil is enormous and you're doing 40 kilometers 80  
**[0:51:03-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:51:03):**  of your ingredients come from 40 kilometers that means there are a lot of these radiuses you can  
**[0:51:07-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:51:07):**  you can draw on the map and we are another one yes that's part that's part of the plan and but what  
**[0:51:14-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:51:14):**  we want to do for next two years is go to us just to prove that we can replicate the model internationally  
**[0:51:21-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:51:21):**  but in brazil we have opportunities to go to north for instance we're in in the center of brazil but  
**[0:51:27-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:51:27):**  we have we mapped producers in the north and in the south they're doing great they're using dairy  
**[0:51:35-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:51:35):**  their dairy farms producing amazed cheese and milk but yeah that's that's the the knowledge  
**[0:51:43-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:51:43):**  just have this small production in different areas and produce it in small scale and then you can be  
**[0:51:53-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:51:53):**  and scale up and if you could change one thing overnight in the food and egg space what would  
**[0:52:00-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:52:00):**  that be you have a magic wand you have the magic power to do one thing differently and tomorrow  
**[0:52:06-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:52:06):**  morning we wake up and that's the case you have done one thing what would that be yeah  
**[0:52:14-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:52:14):**  there's so many things that would do but i know i know it's one idea  
**[0:52:20-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:52:20):**  but i'll again try to localize everything i'll again try to shift the way we consume and not  
**[0:52:29-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:52:29):**  have avocado every month and just educate consumers and find what's in the surroundings  
**[0:52:36-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:52:36):**  and restore biomes and restore you know local biodiversity we saw that we lost 60 percent  
**[0:52:43-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:52:43):**  of biodiversity since the nine since the 70s after we grew a lot the agribusiness so we lost  
**[0:52:54-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:52:54):**  so much and we came to this tipping point where there's no coming back and i feel that if we  
**[0:53:00-0:53:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:53:00):**  localize and see what is you know in the state and what can be produced there's so many amazing  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:53:07):**  products that the indigenous used to eat and we don't have the privilege to do it so that's  
**[0:53:12-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:53:12):**  you've mentioned about a root in us i bet they have and i bet we can use it and it's going to  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:53:18):**  taste a little bit different but it's going to be as yummy you know and for us we always say that  
**[0:53:23-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:53:23):**  taste is queen because that's the most important part of cdpg band but i will localize if i could  
**[0:53:31-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:53:31):**  have a magic wand and how does that contradicts almost your your wish to repeat in the us if you  
**[0:53:38-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:53:38):**  have so much work laying out for you for the next decades probably in in brazil why not simply i mean  
**[0:53:46-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:53:46):**  simply between markets but inspire someone in the us to do this as well why do you need to to do  
**[0:53:51-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:53:51):**  that which is far from culture far distance simply because it's going to be running two brands in two  
**[0:53:57-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:53:57):**  different countries etc why why is there that that wish to to do something in the us if you have so  
**[0:54:02-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:54:02):**  much work and so much things have to be rebuilt and built in brazil as well i feel that i have  
**[0:54:09-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:54:09):**  a personal wish um to extend the knowledge that we are learning here with new to different sms  
**[0:54:18-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:54:18):**  around the world and that's part of what we are doing we're in so many forums in different um  
**[0:54:25-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:54:25):**  united nations and the good food hub and just different institutions that we're just explaining  
**[0:54:30-0:54:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:54:30):**  things and the way that we're doing here but there is a just a personal wish for me and my family  
**[0:54:36-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:54:36):**  want to move to us and spend a couple of years there um and with the twins and just bring  
**[0:54:42-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:54:42):**  everything that we're learning here to different uh countries and that's one of the ways that we can  
**[0:54:48-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:54:48):**  increase impact the most not only have all knowledge stored in my company but  
**[0:54:55-0:55:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:54:55):**  understand how we can inspire and really explain to other sms sms what we are learning what have  
**[0:55:02-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:55:02):**  been you know going right what have been going wrong and all knowledge shouldn't be only with us

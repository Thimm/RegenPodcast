### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2022-04-26)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:14):**  Why are small and medium CPG, consumer packaged goods companies so important for the regen  transition?  They touch all the parts of the food web.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:22):**  They source from farmers.  They have processing facilities or co-packing facilities.  They interact with large distributors and supermarkets and they interact with consumers.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:30):**  And in all of these relationships they can nudge and disrupt for regeneration.  But maybe most importantly, they are nimble and can turn a company around in a matter  of months or years as we learn in the interview today.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:41):**  Plus why we should focus on regeneratively disrupting meat and dairy and not waste too  much time on the very crowded plant-based space.  The real innovation is happening and has to happen in animal protein.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:00:59):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:01:13):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Try my focus on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  have their roots in how we treat our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:01:28):**  and consume.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:07):**  Welcome to another episode.  Today we dive deep into the food side of things with the founder and CEO of Noob.  Welcome Rafaela.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:13):**  Hi, thanks.  Good to be here.  So to start with the personal question we always start with, how did you end up focusing  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:22):**  so much on soil and regeneration?  Actually this started, well I started the company five years ago but looking on regeneration  was only two and a half years ago when my twin girls were born and it was six months  
**[0:02:41-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:02:41):**  before COVID hit and I live in Rio and my parents farm are in Minas Gerais and when  COVID hit we went back to the farm, me, my husband, my two kids and my dog in the car  and it's a 12-hour drive and while we were driving back to the farm we could see the  
**[0:03:02-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:03:02):**  difference from the Atlantic forest to Brazilian savannah and how agribusiness impact the landscape  that I used to see since I was little and when I got in the farm and I had these two  kids of six months old and I was running a food company, I started questioning myself  
**[0:03:24-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:03:24):**  the impacts of the company that I was creating, the future of the kids and I decided to investigate  how the impacts of the system and I remember the first number that I saw was Fowl's report  from 2014 saying that if we still do things like we do we only have 60 harvests left,  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:03:43):**  I know that that's a statement that has a lot of discussion nowadays but that was the  first time that I saw how broken the food system is and that we need to fix in some  way and back then all of my products used dairy ingredients and back then the only solution  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:04):**  was to go plant-based and I was so like it didn't make any sense for me because cheese  bread started in the 18th century and it wasn't common for me to think of the recipe as a  plant-based so I was confused and trying to find a way and I saw Kiss the Ground and I  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:27):**  learned about regenerative agriculture and that's where it all started.  And let's unpack a bit, you mentioned just like that in passing cheese bread which is  the foundation of your company for anybody that doesn't know what cheese bread, I mean  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:41):**  you can make an imagination but describe to us what is cheese bread, what is the cheese  bread you're selling and what is cheese bread mostly in Brazil?  Yeah have you ever tried cheese bread?  
**[0:04:51-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:04:51):**  I haven't no.  Oh my god okay.  So I'm looking for a visual description as we're in Audi obviously like this is, we're  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:05:00):**  recording this on Monday morning very early for you so what would a cheese bread look  like, how does it smell, what does it taste?  I just ate some today in the morning, I just baked some but cheese bread is for Brazilians  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:05:15):**  sort of like croissant as in France or like bacon in the US is the number one bakery consumed  in Brazil and it was created in the 18th century.  Actually the history behind it it's so interesting and I think that a lot about regeneration  
**[0:05:34-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:05:34):**  we don't talk so much about cultural impact and you know how cuisine is founded and how  it was created and the needs for us to preserve old recipes but and that's why I found it  cheese bread history so interesting because it was created in the 18th century probably  
**[0:05:57-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:05:57):**  by a woman slave and she, we used to eat bread with wet that came from Portugal and the quality  was really bad and we would eat, we would pick eggs and cheese and milk and some sort  of fat in the farm and mix it all with wet and make a bread and at some point some woman  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:06:23):**  decided to leave the wet out of the equation and put the base of indigenous cuisine that  is tapioca that's manioc so she used...  So switch the grain, the imported grain or wheat for an indigenous substance and then  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:06:42):**  it became what it is now.  Yeah and so this is so unique because you know it took what it was here before Brazil  was colonized by Portugal it was you know everyone was eating manioc it's a root that's  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:06:58):**  originally from the rainforest and that's what you know what gets the flower the tapioca  flower the yucca flower and that's what cheese bread is it's yucca powder, eggs, cheese,  milk, butter, salt, it's so simple it's clean label and yeah it's a huge market in Brazil.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:07:23):**  And you decided to set up a company focusing on that and then how different let's say is  the cheese bread now compared to five years ago when you started?  Like you said they've been only on a journey for two and a half years I think that's quite  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:07:36):**  a lot honestly I think many many people arrived a lot later and but in that journey of two  and a half years what what has changed in in the company a lot of things obviously but  in the cheese bread itself like would we if we compared it to would we recognize huge  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:07:50):**  differences if we look them next to each other?  Not really the the recipe stays the same and that's one of the things that we do at NU  if we open our all of our recipes just because you know if you want to do a recipe in whatever  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:08:07):**  you are you can do it so if you go online you have the ingredients and the ingredients  didn't change we used to use smallholder farmers ingredient and just you know raw milk cheese  and all this super neat products but what changed was the way that we do it that changed  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:08:27):**  a lot because we used to produce in a co-packer and when I was investigating this impact of  the food system you know in the future I saw that a lot of startups and food techs they  decentralized the whole operations just because it's more it's easy that way so the negative  
**[0:08:48-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:08:48):**  focus on scaling up and to me when I found you know the the impact that we make producing  these products I saw that we needed to scale deep and that's when we decided to create  our own factory and to look at this made at the source value chain and see how we can  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:10):**  go to smallholder farmers and bring knowledge of regenerative agriculture and agroforestry  and just pivot the model to try to bring impact to the whole chain so that's what changed  but the product itself didn't change and we launched other products also after that.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:29):**  Yeah let's unpack them in a second but just for the cheese bread how big is a normal cheese  bread is it like the size of a croissant the size of a bagel is it bigger or smaller and  how do you eat it is it mostly breakfast?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:40):**  Well it has a lot of it's a lot no it's different sizes but it's smaller it's sort of like well  you can see me but people can't see me but it's that big.  Like a coin a big coin.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:09:52):**  Yeah a little yeah a little bit bigger and you bake and it's like a ball a little ball  like cheese they say cheese rolls in US as well and you bake it in the morning so you  can do in your air fryer or in your oven I mean just bake it for 15 minutes and it's  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:10:10):**  ready and here people in Brazil eat obviously at breakfast but we sell to a lot of restaurants  that eat that put it in their entrées and hotels if you go to any hotel in Brazil you're  gonna have cheese bread in breakfast so yeah it's very spread.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:10:29):**  And when did you decide to launch products alongside that was it before or let's say  after beginning of pandemic or your regenerative journey started?  It was after so cheese bread if you go to a supermarket here in Brazil you're gonna  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:10:46):**  have a frozen sector of cheese bread as big as pizza for instance so it's really big.  It's almost 2 billion reais market in Brazil.  When you look at cheese bread what happened and that's one of the reason that I found  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:11:02):**  the company was that the cheese bread that was created in the 18th century and that you  can find in the farms are not the ones that you're finding obviously in the supermarket  because companies ultra industrialize the product and sometimes they don't even have  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:11:17):**  cheese even though they are called cheese bread in Portuguese they're called pão de  queijo so it's all like yeah it's the same translation so that was the hint that I had  to bring back this recipe to consumers and then after a while in the supermarket and  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:11:36):**  we're today in the biggest retails in Brazil we saw that only with one product we couldn't  deliver all change and we would we wouldn't be so relevant to to retails as if we had  different products and then we looked at Manioc and and there is this interesting book from  
**[0:11:58-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:11:58):**  Alex Atala he's I think the biggest chef today in Brazil and he launched this he wrote this  book called Manioc and if you're interested in knowing about Manioc it's amazing book  and he goes to indigenous villages in the rainforest and see how many sub products you  
**[0:12:17-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:12:17):**  can have from Manioc so you can have something to drink you can have something to have sweets  on it or salt just it's so wild and naturally gluten-free so we started developing other  products with the same base as is in Yucca so we launched tapioca sticks that's only  
**[0:12:41-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:12:41):**  three ingredients tapioca cheese and milk and now we launched five skews of gluten-free  tapioca pizza and this line was created after we put in these three fillers on regenerating  SMEs of and CPG brands that's the made at the source the production you know the factory  
**[0:13:06-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:13:06):**  and product pipeline because product pipeline if you think when when you if you put regeneration  in front of any product launch you just you know there is a wheel that you pull virtuous  wheel and that's what we did in the last launch and in this tapioca has obviously been indigenous  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:13:28):**  has been in Brazil forever why is it such a interesting plant let's say from I mean  from the food perspective there are a million different ways you can consume it and from  a soil perspective why is it an interesting one that you said okay we need this in more  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:13:43):**  in more products we need to get closer to this this specific plant I guess that we are  now doing that we did a project with to find out how we can put many arc and other savannah  trees in the same agroforestry and see how this this route can increase soil and and  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:14:10):**  you know work in the ecosystem but what we see today that is since it's naturally from  Brazil and it's so vast and there's so many people using and producing and obviously it's  originally from the rainforest but it's all over all around Brazil we just want to use  
**[0:14:31-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:14:31):**  what's here what's local and see because today every production that we see here from many  of its monoculture we don't have it implemented in agroforestry systems so we don't know  how it's going to be after we're doing the project with Prisateja and that's what we  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:14:53):**  want to find out what are the inputs that we have compared to wheat for instance we  don't have that number today and I mean there are so many different ways to take it but  how how is the consumer responded like we we've often heard I mean it's already tricky  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:15:11):**  to to put organic on let me most people don't really know what what's behind the labels  and then when you take it to a whole new level which is regenerative what have you done on  like packaging on communication or maybe nothing you just go for the taste and what has been  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:15:29):**  that that communication journey or that that conversation journey with your with your consumers  on this journey I'm laughing because regeneration it's a it's a tricky word right people just  don't know how to pronounce it it's just it's it's not so spread here in Brazil and that's  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:15:46):**  why it was so interesting to find your podcast and this movement going around the world but  in Brazil it's not so consumers don't know there are people working in food business  that know about regeneration obviously but the consumers don't know about it so we don't  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:16:02):**  put regeneration in the in the packaging what we did was we're carbon neutral today so we  put it the carbon footprint and the in the product and some other stamps that defines  all this circular economy and the fact that we are woman-owned and the fact that we are  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:16:24):**  carbon neutral and you're using small folder farmers ingredients but regeneration as a  word we don't put it in the in the packaging just because it's sort of talking about yoga  a year before yoga is mainstream and everybody looks at you like what yeah they don't they  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:16:43):**  don't see I mean even though in Brazil it seems like especially in the agroforestry  side of things it's extremely developed compared to to other places there's so much happening  on centropic agroforestry and agroforestry in general of course there's so much happening  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:16:59):**  on the agri business on the other side as well yeah and but there's there seems to be  quite a bit happening there so if you're like in terms of sourcing in terms of talking to  people in the business in the food business do you see there an interest in in these topics  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:17:16):**  do you see there is it easy to find your peers and people to work with and to to source and  to to build these products at the end because at the end of the day you're making things  that end up on the supermarket shelves of the biggest supermarkets in Brazil yeah no  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:17:31):**  it's not so easy well you may have this impression that things are going here in Brazil in terms  of you know agroforestry and centropic movements because you have some good players but it's  not you know just commodity and it's just so huge here and obviously the the government  
**[0:17:50-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:17:50):**  doesn't put any energy whatsoever in regeneration so it's a bubble and what we did was to find  these peers as you've said and the people that were working in the field and one of  our counselors that's in our board of advisors it's from Fazenda da Toca do you know their  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:18:08):**  work I know their work we have never been obviously because I've never been to Brazil  but also I haven't interviewed them but we interviewed a few people I think that have  worked there and just yeah all of them yeah but just describe for the people that didn't  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:18:22):**  listen to that what what is Fazenda da Toca? Fazenda da Toca is from so there is this big  chain in Brazil called Pão de Açúcar it's the second biggest one in Brazil after Carrefour  and the founder's son used to be a pilot actually from the Formula One how to call that the  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:18:45):**  car race car driver yeah yeah Formula One race car driver yeah and he left everything  and just bought this farm and started working with regeneration and now they are the biggest  ag producer in Brazil and they also started working with grains so they're the biggest  
**[0:19:04-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:19:04):**  corn organic with resoma right with resoma agro it's in the in the farm and now recently  two years ago one year ago they they also incorporated a no carbon company called no  carbon milk no carbon cheese so it's a huge farm working in different fields and their  
**[0:19:26-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:19:26):**  CEO is in our board of advisors just because I watched him talking in this webinar and  I was like I need to you know understand what you're doing because there's not a lot of  people doing this in Brazil and now he's in our board of advisors so it's pretty cool  
**[0:19:43-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:19:43):**  and in in the region that we are at 80 percent of our suppliers come from 40 kilometers from  the factory so we are very local and when we started building the factory in the same  time we were looking for small other farmers that had this mindset and there is there was  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:20:06):**  zero no one in the surroundings and this is a big agribusiness area no one was looking  at agroforestry or having these principles and so we started going to the government  and to different institutions to find resources to go to at least one smallholder farmer and  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:20:27):**  do him as a living lab for others to see what he's doing and we were funded by the international  development bank to do this the shift from one one farm that'll do raw milk cheese should  do a carbon neutral raw milk cheese so we're implementing this project powered by the international  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:20:49):**  development bank but this is just something that you need to go through different areas  just because we're a small company we don't have the resources needed to educate and do  workshops but we're we're a voice now in the region so much and and with that one farm  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:21:08):**  let's say in transition now is the interest shifting and of course with your interest  to to buy these ingredients like there isn't there is an off-taker there's a buyer for  this it's not that you're you're pushing them to to change to something and and then there's  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:21:21):**  nobody to to buy anything is is it shifting the conversation over the last like as there  as you see that something concrete is is happening is there something something shifting or is  it still pushing pushing up the hill no it is from two years to now and obviously after  
**[0:21:40-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:21:40):**  esg became big with big food companies there is a need for suppliers and you see big big  companies like danone or uni level or nestle they're looking for this smallholder farmers  that does any of this practices and at the last food summit we were part of this program  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:22:07):**  powered by Rockefeller foundation and i don't know if you heard of it it's called game changers  lab did you did you hear anything about it yeah heard about it but tell me what it is  because yeah it was an interesting topic so they from for the food summit the idio and  
**[0:22:27-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:22:27):**  Rockefeller foundation and a lot of different institutions came up with this sort of accelerated  where they divided into four the 24 cohorts and my cohort was to scale the forestry was  to find a solution to scale agroforestry and we had people from africa europe here in brazil  
**[0:22:48-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:22:48):**  so different people working this project for six months and we came up with this idea called  agropedia where a smallholder farmer and since i'm from the farm my parents are from the  farm i know the reality of a Brazilian smallholder farmer he doesn't have the resources to do  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:23:05):**  this shift so agropedia it's a it's an online resource where he goes and see you know i  have a farm and this this is the size of the farm what's the marketplace you know like  who who's gonna buy for me what's what's the noni wants what nestle wants or what this  
**[0:23:25-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:23:25):**  big companies want and what are they willing to pay because there is a premium price for  this product and so yeah so agropedia is coming we're we also were funded and we're just developing  the platform to do some resource to give to some smallholder farmers some resources to  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:23:48):**  do this shift but it's a work in progress i mean it's just it takes long it's gonna  be a long journey and what kind of products like what products do you think let's say  you had a clean slate you can develop any product you you wanted i mean the resources  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:24:06):**  are there what would you develop to unlock that potential of agroforestry like what would  be needed to to really pull instead of push maybe um yeah there is this number that i  always oftenly think that we can eat 31 000 different plants and 43 of all we eat comes  
**[0:24:28-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:24:28):**  from corn wheat and soy i mean it's just it we narrow down so much the possibilities that  we have so um here in brazil obviously there are the the superfood ingredients from the  rainforest but savannah itself it's and beyond that we are working in the factory it's that  
**[0:24:50-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:24:50):**  um there's so many nuts and fruits and you know acai that's so famous in brazil it's  a super ingredient but you have many as a root um you have coffee here in brazil pretty  big and there's just so many resources and in my company what we're trying to do is to  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:25:08):**  put livestock um in the equation because i feel that there are a lot of people working  with plant-based um products and um we see from faust forecast that the consumption from  meat and dairy products are going to increase at least we're going to increase at least  
**[0:25:27-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:25:27):**  in 50 percent till 2050 so we need to find ways to put you know the cow in the equation  so to me i'm more interested in understanding how we can work with dairy products in a regenerative  perspective and obviously using um other resources such as many to create these amazing tasty  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:25:48):**  products yeah do you see that i mean that is there a pushback as well in in brazil  on um let's say the animal animal agriculture side and and your story or your push there  to say let's see how we use the cow and not necessarily um and take that completely out  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:08):**  of the equation is that something that's been happening there because i see it globally  like it's immediately let's get rid of all animals because we need to be plant-based  and um often forgetting that like fertilization has to come from somewhere it's either from  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:21):**  gas or from very very large scale compost facilities which we need a lot of time and  space or from animals and and i mean we know the the issues with gas especially i mean  not only environmental but also political as we see in the last last months like is  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:36):**  that discussion happening in brazil as well like what or is it is it more like the animal  is is still more part of the the agriculture system or the future system of mostly i mean  there's always city people that never visit their farm let's say let's get rid of the  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:26:50):**  animals they saw a few documentaries and think how agriculture work works but how is that  discussion when you say i want the animal to be part of the the system is that you get  pushback for that or no um yeah so brazil has more cows than people can you imagine  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:27:05):**  that we're a huge player currently in a country i mean the netherlands slaughters which is  not a good thing at all 1.2 billion chickens a year so i mean there are places which you  would be surprised about the amount of animals um yeah but okay so the cow is a fundamental  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:27:21):**  it's a strong part of the the culture it's a strong part and we export a lot a lot of  it but we consume a lot of meat in brazil as well it's part of our cuisine and uh our  plant base is it's rising especially in food tags and startups and venture capitals are  
**[0:27:38-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:27:38):**  looking for it and i think it's a legit the legit the legit legit legit it's legit it's  legit um and i think it's uh yeah but um i think that we have a huge we're missing out  a huge opportunity to understand how we can use dairy products in a regenerative way and  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:28:04):**  we don't see a lot of venture capitals investing in this in brazil and i just i a couple months  ago i saw that bill gates invested in a no carbon milk and everyone was like you know  so oh my god you need to be investing in plant based and this is not the solution but we  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:28:20):**  see that you know and this is one of the books that i'm reading uh defending beef have ever  uh seen this book yeah we had we had her arm actually nicolette in their show notes uh  around christmas last year it's it's very interesting it's so interesting in terms of  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:28:37):**  data and and where a lot of these reports come from and and how they are let's say statistical  not not statistically not really well like well founded and never been never retracted  and these numbers stay out there like 50 of emissions come from livestock which is somebody  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:28:54):**  once said it somewhere it's completely nonsense but it stays there forever in in the general  mindset so yeah um i think there's so you're saying there's a huge opportunity there to  look at dairy which is true i don't hear anybody or very few people talk about let's let's  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:29:11):**  just let's um disrupt dairy it's usually then plant-based instead of using or let's disrupt  dairy with dairy yeah and see how to do that and what what are examples of that like what  are what are you working on or working with that is really fundamentally different from  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:29:26):**  the dairy industry we now see which is mostly inside feeding a lot of soy and corn even  even though sometimes organic but still that i mean there are a lot of questions to be  asked and then we get a dairy product out of there that yeah we can ask a lot of questions  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:29:38):**  about um what what is the dairy you're you're envisioning or working with um yeah so we work  with um as small holder farmers that have uh up near 50 hectares farm so they're not big so it's  good in terms of how you can implement um different systems and crop rotations and you know it's  
**[0:30:05-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:30:05):**  easier than big lands but at the same time they don't know about this resources and that's the key  um issue that we're seeing how we can bring the message to these farmers so we're using this  um different institutions to support us so government the ministry of agriculture environment  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:30:27):**  and this different project such as the one that i've mentioned with the international development  bank but we are also using starting different peers other peers that are working with uh methane  and how um you know cow feed can decrease methane emissions and how we can the crop rotation can  
**[0:30:48-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:30:48):**  sequestrate carbon and decrease also gas emissions and um the taste of the product also changes a lot  and that's one of the key things yeah um so how did it change since you i mean how how would you  again we're we're an audio program but like how does the taste changes when the milk changes or  
**[0:31:09-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:31:09):**  what the cow ate and how the cow ate this is so and this is so we're so uh we need to develop so  much in terms of how we understand food because when you go to a supermarket when you go to a  shop you go to a restaurant you know that today you're going to have your favorite favorite plate  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:31:26):**  and tomorrow it might taste different right have ever had this experience where you go to a  restaurant and like it's like the difference more i don't know um you just know that you expect that  from a restaurant but when you go to the supermarket and you get a package you as a consumer  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:31:46):**  um have this knowledge that you're gonna have the same thing and the same you know taste over and  over again because that's how food industry developed our our brain i mean if you eat a  mcdonald's here in brazil another one in japan it's gonna have the same taste because everything  
**[0:32:02-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:32:02):**  is ultra industrialized and this is something that we are putting in the package this is a natural  you know with artisan ingredients and handcrafted ingredients and it's gonna taste the same because  it's not gonna taste the same because it's natural and you know naturally it's not gonna taste the  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:32:21):**  same and that's one of the things that we see that from different farms and we buy from different  farms the cheese um they just taste different and we have uh in the factory you have a room a cheese  room and we say that they hear country music because you know the wines in in argentina or  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:32:40):**  in france they hear like classical yeah like classic music um we hear country music but just  just fun fact but um we see difference from different uh farms and it just tastes better  i don't know how we we haven't put it um any lab data on it but it tastes better  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:02):**  do you ever get complaints like people saying yeah but this wasn't like this package is different  than that one oh yeah did you ever get comments on that like yeah and then what do you respond and  the color is also different and i'm like okay so the chicken put in some eggs that has more orange  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:20):**  color in it this season and you know that's just gonna happen and we don't like butter changes  color i had a conversation last week with someone and said yeah of course during the season butter  change it if you have grass fat butter or grass fat cows that the butter changes color and for sure  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:35):**  changes fat content depending on the pasture and they never thought about it you could see the  light bulbs going on um like oh my god it's actually it's an alive product and it changes and  it yeah it depends on the season etc exactly and like is that i mean i can't imagine that your  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:33:54):**  customers that are buying these products are off put by that because otherwise they would be going  for the industrialized one but how do you respond to that as a customer service like yeah  this is this is nature welcome welcome to the season or pictures yeah we have this um we have  
**[0:34:09-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:34:09):**  this new ladder called newa and we started eight months ago after we were deep diving in the  regeneration and we just had this mission to inform consumer that everything changes and it's  so neat i'm gonna send it to it's in portuguese though but it's so neat we have a journalist  
**[0:34:29-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:34:29):**  that goes and interview chefs and go to farmers and interview them to see what's in the season  just i think that this is a message that we want to educate consumers to understand that nature  doesn't it's not in their disposal just because you know they want to it's not because they want  
**[0:34:46-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:34:46):**  to eat avocado every month that they should be eating because it's no driving overseas this  avocado and doesn't make any sense and that's why um the first question that you've asked that's why  i think that everything should be local we need to be eating as much as we can pick things that  
**[0:35:04-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:35:04):**  are produced here and in the seasons and respecting nature when you see that enormous attention that  let's say the the industrialized plant-based meats get or plant-based dairy and and the investors  are all um it seems really it seems really hyped or like the amount of attention going in that  
**[0:35:25-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:35:25):**  space what would you tell a room full of investors about the the excitement or the potential of  regenerative dairy and regenerative cheese and regenerative beef etc or meat in general or  proteins like what would you um say to a group like imagine we're in in a in a live theater and  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:35:43):**  it's a room full of investors and you've convinced them about okay nature is extremely important  or extremely fundamental they will walk out to at the end of the evening and and what would you tell  them obviously without giving investment advice but where would they start looking more where  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:35:57):**  would they start um digging a bit deeper or where where to start as an investor in this space because  it's so easy to join the hype on the left let's say on the right whatever side you choose but the  hype that is going okay we just have to to build a lot of huge factories with fermentation fats  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:36:14):**  etc and and all these slides look amazing and the everything just goes up and up and up and the  rounds seem to to never end and and then we're sort of in the other side saying yeah but actually  there there might be another way and there might be a different way like how do we what would you  
**[0:36:28-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:36:28):**  tell them if investors are interested to explore further i would say that just look at the numbers  and what size you know how big is dairy products compared to plant-based how big is meat products  compared compared to plant-based it's gonna only i know that plant-based is going to increase but  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:36:49):**  meat consumption and dairy consumption it's also going to increase and these are the biggest sales  in the supermarket i mean i have one of our distributors um he is he he uh he sells 400  million reais per year and it's huge and 50% of everything that he sells it's meat  
**[0:37:10-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:37:10):**  so people are eating meat it's part of their daily routine they you know use butter in every  morning and they are eating cheese every morning so um i feel they're missing out an opportunity  to go to the market that it's already developed it's already inherent in every cuisine every show  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:37:29):**  and there is a lot of people in the plant base but few people in dairy looking at dairy ingredients  and and meat itself and i feel that we're just missing this opportunity to find you know how  you can incorporate regeneration um in the products they're already selling and that they're in the  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:37:49):**  the biggest sales actually um in the retail so i would just look for this tradition and and  people usually say oh you you sell cheese bread this is not there's no innovation there is no  technology obviously there's a lot of technology involved um you know from a dairy perspective but  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:38:07):**  also from the many of that's the root and that's going to come the dairies uh up in it and we're  going to put the product up but um how many technology you can unfold from you know understanding  maniac as a superfood ingredient then you can have a pasta or you can have a flower you can have so  
**[0:38:27-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:38:27):**  many other ingredients and bake it with dairy products that's what we are trying to do i think  it's a very interesting point i mean there's an enormous amount of innovation happening and it  needs to happen which involves a lot of technology but going to the the sector that is already  
**[0:38:45-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:38:45):**  developed and that that needs a massive shift i mean there's no there's no question about it but  it's not going to disappear tomorrow nor in 10 years even if we completely are disrupted by any  cellular ag etc it's just it won't i don't think it won't uh disappear that quickly um and so we  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:06):**  if we like it or not we need to change that sector just as we if we like it or not in general we need  to change agriculture even if tomorrow we we invent the the best modular nuclear fusion machine  that we can scale really really quickly and we get our fossil fuel in in a second or we scale  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:22):**  solar extremely quickly we still have to change agriculture if we like it and and so it's uh it's  a shame that it's but it's neglected which should be very exciting for investors and other people in  the space because there are not so many others which means you can make a huge difference and  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:37):**  you can play a huge role if you want to um because yeah it's it's literally as you were sort of  referring to as calling in the desert like you were uh you were quite lonely in that place maybe  still are partly that is changing but it's still there is there's a lot of room for other innovation  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:39:53):**  and there's a lot of room for investments and there's a lot of room for technology and people  like oh yeah let's go back to how it was a hundred or two hundred years ago i think they they really  they really need to visit the farm and see the potential of drones of certain light equipment  
**[0:40:08-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:40:08):**  new robotics of virtual fencing of processing on the spot um or much more local and to keep all  this freshness of um obviously the dna dna sequencing following bio acoustics i mean there's so much  i heard somebody's talking about an ai um an ai use case to help farmers incorporate cover crops  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:40:32):**  um and i mean there there's a lot on the technology side to do there but i think it's a very good  message let go where the opportunity is and this is this is a blue ocean basically so what would  you do if you would be an investor let's say you you're not running new because you cannot both run  
**[0:40:46-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:40:46):**  a company and put a lot of money to work and have twins and do a gazillion other things for sure but  if you had to put let's say a billion dollars to work um could be in brazil could be anywhere else  what would you focus on like what would be the main would it be really on the food company side  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:41:02):**  would it be on technology side would it be on a transition finance all of the above but what  was your your main where would you start i'm very interested in understanding the power of  smes they're looking up different ways to produce products so um there is this group called the good  
**[0:41:22-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:41:22):**  food hub that i'm involved in it was created from for from me and after the food summit and it's a  hub where there are a lot of smes around the world we i we won the the prize for united nations 50  best small business and we are all together and it's just so interesting to see this smes working  
**[0:41:44-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:41:44):**  in different fields to fix the broken food system so i would definitely look at this small startups  that are in different areas just trying to understand how you can produce products and  in a nature positive way and not just decentralizing the whole operation because that's  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:42:03):**  just something that when you go to the supermarket and you see everything now all this packaging this  is agribusiness you know agribusiness is a it's inside all of those packaging so if you don't see  if you don't look if smes don't look how they are impacting the whole system um who's going to do  
**[0:42:24-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:42:24):**  that you know big corporations are having their um their plans for 2040 2050 but smes can shift  now and we did that in two years we shifted the whole model so i would definitely look at smes  around the world and um they're usually entrepreneurs passionate about you know  
**[0:42:46-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:42:46):**  their clematarians and they're passionate about regeneration and and regenerating also  recipes right that's one of the things that we've mentioned people are not talking so much about  um indigenous recipe or grandma recipes or things that were used you used to eat your grandmother  
**[0:43:04-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:04):**  used to eat and you don't find it any longer so i would put some investment in those people  yeah i think it's very interesting that sort of layer i mean we keep it keeps coming back i don't  know over the last six months or so uh with poor light food as well which i will put in the in the  
**[0:43:21-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:21):**  climate neutral or climate positive food companies like this layer which is beyond the farm and and  sort of is that interaction between the farm or the land and our consumer or the hospital that  buys it or the restaurant i mean but there is a layer in between because many many products  
**[0:43:38-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:38):**  rightfully so are not going to end up on a farmer's market and we don't buy directly from  the farmer because they have to be processed in a good way and processing is not necessarily an  ugly word but somehow there is a transformation going on there and that layer is so fundamental  
**[0:43:51-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:43:51):**  and you're saying there's a huge opportunity there but because there are these companies that can  shift if they haven't already done so and they have a lot of space to grow because what you see  and i think just asking the question the consumer is ready for for this the consumer wants clean  
**[0:44:08-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:44:08):**  label exactly not every consumer but enough of it to have an interesting business obviously have you  seen a shift there as well yes like the last years well there was a research run here in brazil last  year and said that 83 of consumers want to buy sustainable products but they don't want to spend  
**[0:44:28-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:44:28):**  more so that's a tricky thing because they want to buy from um you know local producers and obviously  with impact but they don't want to spend more just because inflation is huge here in brazil  um but i feel that you we have an opportunity to produce products in a more intelligent way  
**[0:44:46-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:44:46):**  and we saw that when we built the factory i mean it's cheaper to have clean energy to have solar  panels it's it's cheaper to storage rainfall rainwater and use it in the in the factory i mean  if you bring technology but also sustainability and you can see circular economy principles  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:45:06):**  it's going to be cheaper it doesn't need to be expensive more expensive the product and  so there is obviously a shift and i feel that food food tax and and startups it doesn't need  to be a food tech but startups that are having cpg brands they work in so many different areas  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:45:24):**  right because they dialogue with farmers because they need to buy the ingredients they dialogue  with co-packers or they eat the process that in their own factories they dialogue with consumers  the dialogue with retailers i mean there are so many different stakeholders they can change  
**[0:45:41-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:45:41):**  yeah and that's why i'm so um interested in seeing how this this food tax can change  perspective perception in different areas so you're arguing that that's the biggest lever we have  or leverage point we have are the food companies and especially the small to medium sized ones  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:02):**  because they're still nimble they can shift around in a couple of years or a couple of  months if they're very small and and they can grow quite rapidly and in touch a lot of farmers a lot  of land and a lot of people obviously on the consumer side but also all the other stakeholders  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:16):**  you interact with they will be and maybe at the beginning they're annoyed at this regeneration  piece comes up again or maybe they're like oh they're talking again about recycled rainwater  etc but at some point yeah it becomes almost normal like you're you're definitely opening  
**[0:46:29-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:29):**  a path there which is very tiring but those are very needed yeah and i think that the key point  it's how much can we grow and this was a aha moment that i had a couple of months ago i was  with my husband and we ordered mcdonald's because we're in this business but sometimes you drink  
**[0:46:51-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:46:51):**  coca-cola or something you know i'm not so rigid and we ordered mcdonald's and we were eating  mcdonald's and we were eating mcdonald's and i thought if new was the size of mcdonald's how  how it would be how could that be possible and that's the thing about cpg brands once they grow  
**[0:47:12-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:47:12):**  they can't sustain regeneration that much because you know if i i have a hundred tons uh factory  here in brazil but if i go to 10 000 tons per month i'm not gonna have the suppliers local  suppliers i'm not i'm gonna export to netherlands and you're gonna eat it and you know um we're  
**[0:47:30-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:47:30):**  just gonna um yeah it's a contradiction so then i thought how can a cpg brand be global  and at the same time doesn't harm the ecosystem and the and that's the theory that we're going  through and that's why i mentioned that we're going for the first round of investment is  
**[0:47:50-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:47:50):**  that we're expanding but being global but at the same time being local and that's the only way  you can't produce here in brazil and export all around the world you need to go to us and see  who are the dairy producers who are the egg producers you know how you can find local  
**[0:48:08-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:48:08):**  farmers and smallholder farmers and how can you produce there and then sell it there and go to  europe and go to you know um repeat yeah exactly so you can be a global cpg brand um and be a  regenerative with a nature positive perspective but you need to be local that's the only way that  
**[0:48:29-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:48:29):**  we found is that what you referred to at the beginning as scaling deeply is that the similar  or is that connected to it yes and then how does it look like would it be sort of a collection of  global brands under the same principles guiding principles because different would it be different  
**[0:48:46-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:48:46):**  food as well because it's not a different brazilian cheese bread in kentucky because that's  yeah i mean yeah it would be a funny a funny thing to eat but it's not part of the culture  so you can take the guiding principles and yeah and set up local i wouldn't say versions but like  
**[0:49:04-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:49:04):**  the almost local version but in like the local translated version of what you're building in  brazil or building exactly yeah that's exactly what we're doing um we're gonna obviously we  don't have many in us um and we're gonna need to import but that's the only ingredient we need to  
**[0:49:20-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:49:20):**  import the rest of ingredients we can find it locally and that's the part of scale deep you  need to find local suppliers for your products you can have a co-packer it doesn't need to be  you know you don't need to have a factory but you can find local co-packers and um work with  
**[0:49:38-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:49:38):**  the small other farmers and if you reach a state as we've reached here in brazil you can bind that  you can build a factory but it doesn't need to be um a factory replica replicable replicable  better word as we are doing here in brazil but we're using brazil as a living lab and that's why  
**[0:49:59-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:49:59):**  the factory is within 40 kilometers from the farmers and that's why we're putting the agroforestry from  petaterra we're already doing free range eggs here we need to learn right we need to learn  so then we can teach to other farmers and that's the only solution we see to scale the model  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:50:19):**  it should go deep to go from soil to plate that's the thing about cpg you can go from soil to plate  two things on that wouldn't it be possible to find a local route that is that so you don't  have to import the manioc into some place like what what would it be ideally we would try to find  
**[0:50:39-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:50:39):**  the the local route that that is very unloved but also a superfood and it could be a perfect  ingredient not sure if that's possible and second i'm imagining in brazil there's so many biomes in  so many different regions that are so different from each other that there is a lot of space to  
**[0:50:56-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:50:56):**  repeat there as well to repeat because brazil is enormous and you're doing 40 kilometers 80  of your ingredients come from 40 kilometers that means there are a lot of these radiuses you can  you can draw on the map and we are another one yes that's part that's part of the plan and but what  
**[0:51:14-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:51:14):**  we want to do for next two years is go to us just to prove that we can replicate the model internationally  but in brazil we have opportunities to go to north for instance we're in in the center of brazil but  we have we mapped producers in the north and in the south they're doing great they're using dairy  
**[0:51:35-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:51:35):**  their dairy farms producing amazed cheese and milk but yeah that's that's the the knowledge  just have this small production in different areas and produce it in small scale and then you can be  and scale up and if you could change one thing overnight in the food and egg space what would  
**[0:52:00-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:52:00):**  that be you have a magic wand you have the magic power to do one thing differently and tomorrow  morning we wake up and that's the case you have done one thing what would that be yeah  there's so many things that would do but i know i know it's one idea  
**[0:52:20-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:52:20):**  but i'll again try to localize everything i'll again try to shift the way we consume and not  have avocado every month and just educate consumers and find what's in the surroundings  and restore biomes and restore you know local biodiversity we saw that we lost 60 percent  
**[0:52:43-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:52:43):**  of biodiversity since the nine since the 70s after we grew a lot the agribusiness so we lost  so much and we came to this tipping point where there's no coming back and i feel that if we  localize and see what is you know in the state and what can be produced there's so many amazing  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:53:07):**  products that the indigenous used to eat and we don't have the privilege to do it so that's  you've mentioned about a root in us i bet they have and i bet we can use it and it's going to  taste a little bit different but it's going to be as yummy you know and for us we always say that  
**[0:53:23-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:53:23):**  taste is queen because that's the most important part of cdpg band but i will localize if i could  have a magic wand and how does that contradicts almost your your wish to repeat in the us if you  have so much work laying out for you for the next decades probably in in brazil why not simply i mean  
**[0:53:46-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:53:46):**  simply between markets but inspire someone in the us to do this as well why do you need to to do  that which is far from culture far distance simply because it's going to be running two brands in two  different countries etc why why is there that that wish to to do something in the us if you have so  
**[0:54:02-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:54:02):**  much work and so much things have to be rebuilt and built in brazil as well i feel that i have  a personal wish um to extend the knowledge that we are learning here with new to different sms  around the world and that's part of what we are doing we're in so many forums in different um  
**[0:54:25-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:54:25):**  united nations and the good food hub and just different institutions that we're just explaining  things and the way that we're doing here but there is a just a personal wish for me and my family  want to move to us and spend a couple of years there um and with the twins and just bring  
**[0:54:42-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:54:42):**  everything that we're learning here to different uh countries and that's one of the ways that we can  increase impact the most not only have all knowledge stored in my company but  understand how we can inspire and really explain to other sms sms what we are learning what have  
**[0:55:02-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:55:02):**  been you know going right what have been going wrong and all knowledge shouldn't be only with us  thank you so much for that and i want to be conscious of your your time and i don't think  it's the last time we'll be chatting and thank you so much for sharing this this super early

**[0:56:58-0:57:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:56:58):**  question how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned  what have we seen in the space over the last years how have we built our decision making  
**[0:57:12-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:57:12):**  framework what to focus on with the podcast how have we picked interviewees and what questions  should you ask what is happening in the space what should you read what should you listen what  should you watch how to approach this space for whom is this course you the soil builders and  
**[0:57:30-0:57:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:57:30):**  investors in the space the soil builders people working in this space entrepreneurial farmers  fund managers vehicle builders crowd investing platform builders ag tech companies farm to gut  food companies permaculture key line designers holistic management consultants etc etc people  
**[0:57:45-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:57:45):**  that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money to work through  their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money  to work through foundations institutional capital banks insurance companies etc is this course free  
**[0:58:02-0:58:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:58:02):**  no this is pay what you think it's worth meaning i have no way of knowing what this course will be  worth to you and i'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast and we have people with  very different means so i'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have  
**[0:58:18-0:58:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:58:18):**  the means to consider paying what you think it's worth thank you so what is this course it's  currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus pdf slides so you  don't have to ride along we're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why  
**[0:58:37-0:58:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:58:37):**  extractive agriculture is so risky how to invest what kind of frameworks you could and i think  should build what to invest in and what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of  investors you could find if you're a soil builder every lesson will have a digging deeper part where  
**[0:58:53-0:58:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:58:53):**  i will share what kind of reports what kind of interviews what kind of videos you can look into  if you want to dig deeper we're going to look at nutrient density landscape design and a lot more  so what is it not it's not a list of investable deals unfortunately that doesn't exist in this  
**[0:59:08-0:59:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rafaela-gontijo-lenz#t=0:59:08):**  world we're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution  it's also not investment advice before making any investment please find professional investment  advice so get ready get a cup of coffee a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:00:14):**  What if every restoration project, which could be a farm, a forest or a wetland, is registered  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:00:19):**  on a science-based open data platform and thus the progress, or lack of it, is made  
**[0:00:23-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:00:23):**  transparent for all of us to follow?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:00:26):**  We covered what satellite data can already tell us and what is coming in the future and  
**[0:00:30-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:00:30):**  why Clara is so interested in bioacoustics and biodiversity.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:00:37):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:00:41):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:00:43):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:00:47):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:00:52):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:57-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:00:57):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:00:59):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:03):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:05):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers, start paying much  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:10):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:14):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:18):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:21):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:26):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:39):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:41):**  Welcome to another episode.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:43):**  Today with Clara Roe, the CEO of Restore.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:45):**  Restore is a science-based open data platform to support and connect the global restoration  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:50):**  movement.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:51):**  Welcome, Clara.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:52):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:53):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:54):**  And to start with the personal question I always like to ask, how did you end up in  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:01:59):**  the restoration movement and why are you focusing on restoration of soil and also obviously  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:03):**  of other places, but how did you end up in the restoration movement?  
**[0:02:08-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:08):**  Great question.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:10):**  It's been a whirlwind year since I started at Restore.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:13):**  So it's always fun to kind of look back and remind myself how I got involved in the first  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:17):**  place.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:18):**  Before I was at Restore, I worked in sustainable supply chains.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:23):**  So I worked for a nonprofit that supported companies who were trying to figure out how  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:28):**  to get deforestation and exploitation of people out of their supply chains, palm oil and cocoa  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:34):**  and soy.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:35):**  I worked mostly in Latin America.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:37):**  And what I started to see was that over time, in addition to the no deforestation commitments  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:43):**  that companies were making, there was more and more interest in figuring out how to integrate  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:47):**  their forest and ecosystem related commitments with their climate commitments.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:52):**  And ultimately what that means is restoration of nature of some sort within supply chains  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:02:58):**  on farms.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:03:00):**  And so when Tom Crowther, the founder of Restore, reached out to me over a year ago to say that  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:03:07):**  he was starting this organization and would I like to come on to lead it, it felt like  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:03:11):**  a perfect transition in terms of being able to approach restoration from a different perspective.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:03:17):**  From a science-based and tool-based and digital perspective.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:03:22):**  And so, I mean, I described it in a sentence or a sentence and a half, but what is your,  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:03:27):**  I hate to say elevator pitch, but like Restore in a few sentences or a few more sentences,  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:03:32):**  how would you describe it to your grandparents, your children or anybody that is interested  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:03:37):**  but doesn't really have the background?  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:03:39):**  Right.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:03:40):**  So for me, whenever I talk about what Restore is, I always have to start by talking about  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:03:45):**  what restoration is, what nature restoration is.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:03:48):**  And as we think about it at Restore, restoration is really a continuum that ranges from sustainable  
**[0:03:55-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:03:55):**  agricultural practices and agroforestry to protecting existing ecosystems to restoring  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:04:03):**  in some form or another wetlands and peatlands and forests.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:04:07):**  And so it involves many, many ecosystems.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:04:10):**  I think often we just think about planting trees, but there are of course many other  
**[0:04:14-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:04:14):**  native ecosystems to protect and to restore.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:04:17):**  And it involves many different kinds of intervention.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:04:21):**  So it's not just putting a seedling in the ground.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:04:24):**  It's also often just fencing off an area and allowing it to restore itself.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:04:28):**  And there's this huge potential in that range of nature restoration, one, to be able to  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:04:34):**  draw down carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:04:37):**  So restoration of forests alone has the potential to draw down about 30% of carbon emissions  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:04:44):**  and it has the potential to prevent about 60% of expected biodiversity loss.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:04:51):**  And it could improve food security for over a billion people around the world.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:04:56):**  And so fundamentally Restore's mission is to unlock this potential of nature restoration  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:01):**  for biodiversity and for climate and for people.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:05):**  And we're doing this by bringing together every nature restoration project around the  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:09):**  globe on a single open access platform.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:13):**  Believe it or not, there's actually nowhere you can go today to find all the restoration  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:17):**  work that's happening.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:18):**  You know, whether that's at a large scale or a very small scale, there's just no one  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:22):**  single place.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:23):**  We don't know where it's all happening.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:25):**  And so we are bringing those projects together.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:28):**  We're offering free standardized ecological data to these projects to help them with their  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:33):**  decision making.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:34):**  We're offering best in class satellite monitoring, which allows them to track progress.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:39):**  And also, you know, it brings transparency to these restoration efforts around the world.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:44):**  And by bringing projects together, we're also allowing them to learn from each other and  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:49):**  to gain visibility, you know, whether that's to funders, to other projects, to technical  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:54):**  tools who might be able to provide them support.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:05:57):**  So in a way, you can think of us sort of as a Google Maps for restoration, you know, really  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:06:01):**  putting restoration together on the map.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:06:04):**  What has been the biggest surprise over the last year or general, but what has been your  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:06:10):**  biggest surprise once you started leading restore in terms of I mean, the attention,  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:06:15):**  let's say, has exploded for restoration, regeneration, restoring things in general, but that's maybe  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:06:21):**  not a surprise that maybe we were just waiting for it.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:06:23):**  But what has been your biggest surprise over the last, let's say, 12 months?  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:06:26):**  You know, I think that for me, the incredible positivity in this space has been surprising.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:06:33):**  In, you know, compared to the negative energies in climate in general.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:06:38):**  Yeah, well, yeah, you know, there's, there's a lot of reasons to be worried about the direction  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:06:44):**  that the planet is going.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:06:46):**  But restoration is this very positive space, right?  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:06:49):**  It's not focused on simply protecting what's there and watching, honestly, a lot of what's  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:06:55):**  there disappear.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:06:56):**  It's focused on how can we not only keep what is there today intact, but also grow back,  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:03):**  right?  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:04):**  And so there's just a lot of excitement.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:06):**  There's a lot of potential.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:08):**  We hear because we're bringing together all these restoration projects, we get to hear  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:12):**  from people all over the world.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:13):**  Some people who are just doing this as a hobby in their backyard and, you know, communities  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:18):**  who have been doing this for decades and are excited to connect and to share the work that  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:22):**  they're doing.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:23):**  So it just feels like a very positive, buzzing place to be.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:28):**  And what is, I think investors always like to ask the question of why now?  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:32):**  Like what is it that this moment in time, apart from all the attention, and that's,  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:37):**  I mean, biodiversity finally gets attention, soil gets attention, etc, etc, trees get a  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:42):**  lot of attention.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:43):**  But why, let's say from a technology perspective, or why is this the moment to launch something  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:48):**  and to build something like Restore?  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:50):**  Well, we're running out of time to be able to fight the climate crisis, to be able to  
**[0:07:56-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:07:56):**  fight global poverty as climate also compounds that, to be able to prevent species extinctions.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:04):**  And technology can be an enabler.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:06):**  And for me, enable is that key word, right?  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:09):**  Restoration is the center of what we do.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:11):**  We're just simply trying to, through technology, enable that to happen more efficiently, more  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:17):**  effectively, more responsibly.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:19):**  There's a lot of money on the line.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:21):**  There's a lot of money that needs to be invested in order for restoration and nature-based  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:27):**  solutions more broadly to be able to contribute what they need to contribute to address the  
**[0:08:32-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:32):**  climate crisis by 2050.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:35):**  I've heard a lot of numbers thrown around, but 8 trillion is what is estimated is needed  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:42):**  to be able to unlock the potential of nature-based solutions between now and 2050.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:47):**  And so we need to do that, as I say, efficiently, effectively, responsibly.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:52):**  And that requires transparency.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:54):**  And at Restore, that's what we're trying to bring to this movement right now.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:08:58):**  And what do you see your role as a restore to, let's say, the financial world, the world  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:04):**  that wants to put money to work in an investing way, is not necessarily the grand side of  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:08):**  things.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:09):**  What can you bring already now or like investors that are listening, but what are you also  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:13):**  planning to bring in the near future?  
**[0:09:15-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:16):**  You know, today we're making visible many, many projects that never were visible in the  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:21):**  past.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:22):**  Some of the restoration projects on our platform already have funding.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:27):**  Some of them are seeking ongoing funding.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:30):**  Sometimes they're seeking philanthropic contributions, but sometimes they're open for investment.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:34):**  And so if you are an investor interested in contributing to nature restoration in some  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:39):**  way, again, across that continuum that I described, Restore is a place that allows you to start  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:44):**  looking for where you might be able to invest and also guarantee that there's transparency  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:50):**  in the long term about what's actually happening on the ground where investments are occurring.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:09:55):**  And as we build, we want to make that easier and easier and easier for the transparency  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:00):**  piece for searching, right, for projects to support really building kind of a smart infrastructure  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:05):**  for the way that restoration projects can be connected to funders and that real accountability  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:12):**  happens between that in terms of progress made.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:16):**  There's a lot to unpack there.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:17):**  And in terms of technology, like how do you make sure that transparency is there?  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:22):**  Is that a big part?  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:23):**  And maybe that's why it's happening now, like the satellite part of it, that you make sure  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:27):**  like you cannot choose to not be covered by a satellite, like you will be followed in  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:32):**  a good way or a bad way, but in a good way.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:33):**  In this case, is that the core of that?  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:36):**  Like we can transparently follow these projects, even if the projects itself or the companies  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:40):**  or the farms, etc. don't supply data?  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:43):**  It is.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:44):**  That's a really core piece of it.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:45):**  So when projects join Restore, they have two options.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:50):**  They can join publicly or they can join privately.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:52):**  So if they join privately, the Restore data is really just for them.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:56):**  And no one else can see the boundaries of their project.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:10:59):**  But if they join publicly, which many, many projects are doing now, anyone can see the  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:04):**  boundary of the work that they're doing.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:06):**  And therefore the satellite imagery that we have compiled that is available globally is  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:11):**  available to be able to compare with the boundaries of that work.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:15):**  And there's a number of different sources of satellite imagery that we use.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:19):**  But perhaps the most impactful in terms of the visual progress is the Maxar imagery that  
**[0:11:25-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:25):**  we're hosting.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:26):**  It goes back to 2011 and there's updates every few years.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:30):**  And that's half a meter resolution.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:32):**  So 50 centimeters in some areas, actually 30 centimeters resolution, which essentially  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:37):**  allows you to see every tree.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:41):**  And that's an incredibly powerful tool from a transparency perspective.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:45):**  And just to give people perspective, that's something that's relatively recent that you  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:50):**  have access to, that we as society have access to this kind of level, or is it something  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:55):**  has been around for a while?  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:56):**  Or was it very expensive?  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:11:57):**  Like, why is this happening now?  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:01):**  So I mean, the satellites are getting better and better, like almost every day, it feels  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:05):**  like right, there's launches of new satellites with higher resolution.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:09):**  Is that difficult for you or not to keep up?  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:12):**  It is.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:13):**  Because so much seems to be happening?  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:14):**  Or is it amazing?  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:15):**  I mean, both.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:17):**  We have a geospatial team who is responsible both for making sure that we're bringing in  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:23):**  the best available global satellite data, and also that we're building analytics so  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:29):**  that you can actually derive meaningful insights at scale.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:33):**  So I mentioned this half a meter resolution visual imagery, for example.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:38):**  That's terrific if you're willing to take the time to look at any given place on Earth.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:43):**  But if you wanted to have an automated report that tells you how has the land changed here,  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:48):**  or how many trees here, you need to do additional analytics on top of that.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:52):**  So our team is working with external partners as well to figure out how can we bring the  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:12:58):**  ability to delineate individual tree crowns, for example, to this high resolution imagery.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:04):**  How can we take that imagery and estimate diversity of the area based on the structural  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:10):**  diversity that's visible in terms of forest cover?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:14):**  So that's another key piece is, you can show as much as you'd like to show, but until you  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:19):**  can actually say something meaningful about what that means to a restoration effort, it  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:25):**  has limited utility in terms of the scale that it can reach from a decision making perspective.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:30):**  Yeah, it's what is often referred to.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:33):**  I mean, I think the amount of terabytes of data coming to decision makers, to farmers,  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:38):**  to land stewards, etc, is theoretically enormous.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:41):**  And practically as well.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:42):**  I mean, many people are flying drones that collect so much data that basically will blow  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:46):**  up a hard drive in a second.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:48):**  Exactly.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:49):**  But then the question is, what do you do with that?  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:50):**  How does it translate into doing something or not doing something?  
**[0:13:54-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:54):**  And how does that work?  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:13:55):**  And that there it's where it seems to be where the real juicy part and the magic happens.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:00):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:01):**  And that's a real midterm priority for us is the way that we integrate existing data  
**[0:14:07-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:07):**  that projects might already have and provide meaningful analytics.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:10):**  So drone imagery is a good example.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:13):**  You know, being able to allow projects to upload drone imagery and get simple analytics  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:18):**  in terms of, you know, coverage, in terms of spectral diversity, perhaps.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:23):**  We've been thinking a lot about how we can also help with the bottlenecks in terms of  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:28):**  bioacoustic data processing, which could have huge potential in terms of the ability to  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:34):**  monitor biodiversity.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:35):**  But again, big kind of data storage and analytic challenge.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:38):**  So we would really like to be able to make it so that anyone on Earth can upload some  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:43):**  standard data formats and get useful information from RESTORE about what's happening in their  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:49):**  area and that we can then use that to bring additional transparency to what's happening  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:53):**  everywhere.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:54):**  And just for anybody, how would you describe bioacoustics?  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:14:57):**  Because I know more or less what it is, but I'm really, why is it so promising and why  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:01):**  are you so interested in it?  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:04):**  So, you know, bioacoustics are basically just the sounds that are coming from nature.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:09):**  And I think there's been a lot of focus on, for example, being able to identify birds  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:15):**  and estimate bird biodiversity, but also you can do that for insects.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:19):**  You can actually do it for abiotic, right?  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:21):**  For living factors like water and the sounds that water picks up.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:25):**  So basically when you put together all of those sounds, you know, you get this sound  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:29):**  steep, which you can then use to estimate, you know, how much this area has recovered  
**[0:15:34-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:34):**  in comparison to an intact area.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:37):**  And the reason it's so exciting from a scalability perspective is that in theory, this could  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:43):**  happen through a phone, right?  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:45):**  And anything for me, anything that could happen with a handheld device that many, many people  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:50):**  around the world have access to is something that we should really invest in.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:53):**  And to be clear, it's not perfect yet.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:15:55):**  We can't just take any phone and get a perfect idea of the biodiversity in an area, but there  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:02):**  are more specific recording devices that when used with proper protocols can do that.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:09):**  And we can imagine a path to scale through cell phones.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:13):**  So basically we would be able, maybe with a little add on on our phone or with a really  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:17):**  good phone, and of course with the GPS built into that and the proper app with the right  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:22):**  protocols to make sure that we record a standard, but phones are relatively cheap and they can  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:28):**  store etc.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:29):**  So you can imagine a cheaper way or a much easier way to record a lot of audio from ecosystems  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:35):**  that then could be analyzed when they're uploaded and things like that.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:39):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:40):**  Which, you know, provides an incredible compliment to the information that we can derive from  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:45):**  satellites, which starts to give us a richer and richer perspective on what's actually  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:50):**  happening in these areas that we're trying to restore.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:54):**  And I'll just emphasize, you know, bioacoustic biodiversity.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:16:58):**  It's a very key dynamic as we think about the future of restoration, especially in the  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:17:04):**  next 20 years when there's so much focus on carbon sequestration.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:17:07):**  And that's of course incredibly important.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:17:10):**  But if we only think about that, right, we lose many other dimensions of what makes an  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:17:15):**  ecosystem whole.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:17:16):**  And so the ability to have scalable ways to measure biodiversity and not just carbon is  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:17:22):**  something that we're really interested in helping to bring to the table.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:17:26):**  And how is Restore itself organized as an entity itself?  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:17:30):**  Like what's your quote unquote business model or what's your founding path in that sense?  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:17:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:17:37):**  So we spun off from the Crowther Lab, a science lab at ETH Zurich in Switzerland at the end  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:17:45):**  of 2020.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:17:47):**  So we're about a year old now.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:17:49):**  And we were basically set up as a company that is owned by a charitable foundation.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:17:55):**  So right now, 100% of our shares are owned by the Restore Foundation that was set up  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:18:00):**  in order to be able to protect and restore Earth's ecosystems.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:18:06):**  And that means that we operate in a nimble startup fashion.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:18:11):**  We grew our team last year from one to 12 full-time people and a lot of part-time people  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:18:16):**  spread around the world as well.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:18:18):**  But we fundamentally have a mission to do good.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:18:22):**  And any profit that we generate in the future will be reinvested into the work that we're  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:18:27):**  doing with restoration projects around the world.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:18:31):**  And we're still working on our business model, but essentially, we have a core platform which  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:18:37):**  we intend to keep free forever.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:18:40):**  And we're going to be building digital services, for example, the ability to monitor restoration  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:18:45):**  projects across many sites and compare the ability to select sites for investment and  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:18:50):**  create portfolios around those sites to be able to generate revenue and cover cost over  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:18:55):**  time.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:18:56):**  So we're eager to experiment in 2022 with partners around the digital services that  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:19:02):**  we build and ensuring that we're really adding as much value as possible to the broader restoration  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:19:07):**  ecosystem as we do that.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:19:10):**  I think the setup by being owned by a foundation is extremely interesting.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:19:15):**  We've had Armin Storjnagel of Purpose on the show actually quite a while ago, we should  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:19:19):**  check in.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:19:20):**  But how to preserve or protect the mission of mission-driven companies is obviously a  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:19:26):**  very hot topic in the investment and impact investing movement.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:19:30):**  But do you see a role for investors at some point in restore?  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:19:34):**  Is that too early as you've been basically a year old so far?  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:19:37):**  Yeah, I think it's early for us to decide.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:19:40):**  I think, of course, the key balance that we want to strike is maintaining our core focus  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:19:47):**  on our mission, but having the capital to be able to grow.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:19:51):**  There's not a lot of time to do the things that we need to do in terms of the piece that  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:19:57):**  nature restoration can play in the broader fight against climate change.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:01):**  So we know that we want to be able to scale quickly.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:04):**  So for us, this year, we'll be doing a lot of learning in terms of our ability to both  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:09):**  attract additional philanthropic contributions through the foundation in order to grow our  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:14):**  work, our own ability to generate revenue through digital services and grow that way.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:19):**  And that will help us evaluate the space for investors in the impact that we're trying  
**[0:20:24-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:24):**  to have.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:25):**  And what do you see as a more general role for investors in this restoration movement  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:32):**  and space?  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:33):**  You mentioned, of course, a few projects are looking for investors, etc.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:37):**  But what I imagine I usually like to say, I mean, we're in a digital space now, but  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:41):**  let's say we're recording this in a theater and we're sitting on stage and the room is  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:46):**  full of smart impact investors.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:48):**  They've read the books.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:49):**  They've read the nature based solutions, documentaries, etc.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:51):**  And they want to get involved, obviously without giving investment advice.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:54):**  But what would be your pointers like where to look or where to dig a bit deeper or where  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:20:58):**  to get involved if people want to start getting involved also with their investment amounts?  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:21:02):**  Yeah, I think it's a great question.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:21:05):**  I guess in no particular order, I would say I'll reiterate kind of my message about thinking  
**[0:21:12-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:21:12):**  beyond carbon.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:21:13):**  So as investors are thinking about investing in climate change solutions, thinking about  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:21:19):**  the way that those solutions are also thinking about people and are thinking about biodiversity,  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:21:25):**  remembering that restoration, regenerative agriculture, it's not a silver bullet from  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:21:31):**  a carbon perspective.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:21:33):**  And I think often it's something that I talk a lot about when we talk about restoration  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:21:38):**  because I think kind of a common concern about forest restoration, especially as a solution  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:21:45):**  in the climate world is that we will only focus on that and we will forget that we also  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:21:50):**  will use that as an easy way out.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:21:53):**  And we won't focus on the investments needed in renewables and the changes in behavior  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:21:58):**  that are needed and the changes in government policy.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:00):**  So it's a long way of saying if a project is promising that they are the solution to  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:07):**  climate change, you probably want to look a little bit deeper because it's always just  
**[0:22:11-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:11):**  going to be one piece of the solution.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:14):**  Look for science-backed initiatives as much as possible, I think is really important.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:19):**  What is the tie to the scientific community?  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:22):**  But on the other hand, what is the social focus that projects are bringing?  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:27):**  Because this is really key to the long-term sustainability of work.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:30):**  Yeah, I think they're both very, very good points.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:34):**  We often see in the space people coming with the solution to everything and it could be  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:38):**  an input company.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:39):**  Like if you spray this, then everything grows better.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:42):**  And it's like if we only would do this, then we'll be fine, et cetera.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:47):**  And at the same time at the science piece, it's very difficult, I think, to filter there  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:52):**  because there's so much noise and a lot of things look and sound like science and not  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:22:56):**  necessarily are the way we've had a very interesting scientist turned farmer on the regenerative  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:01):**  egg piece, Jonathan Lundgren in the US that left the scientific world, but not necessarily  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:06):**  he set up a farm and does a lot of research there with the scientific world, but says  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:11):**  in terms of region egg, he says the most interesting things currently are happening on farms.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:15):**  The problem is we, as many university scientists have no longer farmed or haven't farmed in  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:20):**  a long time.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:21):**  So we don't see either what's happening or it sounds impossible.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:24):**  Like this is, you cannot do this according, but he says we have to set farms up again  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:30):**  and then be in deep science work and write the papers and do the work and not the other  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:34):**  way around because otherwise we miss this movement, unfortunately.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:37):**  So there's that tension, but that doesn't mean obviously that we should, I mean, the  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:42):**  scientific principles are extremely important there.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:45):**  No, I'm so glad you brought that up though, because it is, it's about holding that tension  
**[0:23:49-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:49):**  of the knowledge of actually doing right practitioner knowledge, local knowledge, indigenous knowledge,  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:23:56):**  and the ways in which we scale that.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:00):**  One of the paths to scale is through the scientific process and understanding common principles  
**[0:24:06-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:06):**  and thinking about how to bring that elsewhere.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:08):**  So it is a tension to pay attention to and not something I think to be taken lightly  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:14):**  in terms of science providing all of the answers.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:18):**  And especially many things might sound impossible and many things are, but some of them actually  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:24):**  are not and our common knowledge in five or 10 years and we all look back and thought,  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:28):**  of course now we know that the trees communicate to each other.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:31):**  And of course now we, but at that time the person, and I wouldn't say discovering that,  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:36):**  but the person really banging the drum and writing the papers was put away as a complete  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:41):**  idiot.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:42):**  And there are many examples of that.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:43):**  The problem is figuring out which one actually makes sense five or 10 years down the line  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:47):**  and we don't have that time.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:48):**  So it's a very interesting tension to not underestimate the seemingly impossible, which  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:53):**  we have a lot of things like that in regeneration and restoration.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:24:56):**  I mean, we get promised the moon and the stars of stabilizing climate, bringing back rivers  
**[0:25:01-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:01):**  and all of that.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:03):**  And some of it might be true and some of it probably is true, but not all.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:07):**  So what would you do if you would be in charge of a large investment fund?  
**[0:25:11-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:11):**  Could be a billion dollars.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:12):**  I used to say a billion dollars, which was a lot of money until billions started flying  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:15):**  around everywhere, but let's say a lot of money.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:17):**  What would you prioritize if you had to put that to work?  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:20):**  That's such a good and hard question.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:24):**  I think big picture, you start with dividing your values, setting policies.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:31):**  And I mentioned that I used to work in the sustainable agriculture world and the supply  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:37):**  chain world.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:38):**  And there are a lot of good standards that exist out there around no deforestation, no  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:43):**  exploitation, respect for indigenous and local communities and including smallholders and  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:47):**  supply chains.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:49):**  And so I think starting there and saying, what is the baseline?  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:53):**  What are the values that I want to hold as I'm thinking about investment is really important.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:25:59):**  Mapping enabling conditions, government policy, where are subsidies, what is incentivizing  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:26:05):**  or disincentivizing regenerative agriculture around the world.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:26:09):**  And then thinking about a diversity of approaches, both geographically in terms of farm size,  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:26:17):**  bottom up versus top down.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:26:19):**  You can think about going through a giant supply chain, corporate supply chain and reaching  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:26:26):**  farmers that way through their buyers.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:26:29):**  Or you can think about starting at the grassroots.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:26:32):**  And I would want to think about testing several of those different approaches and really building  
**[0:26:37-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:26:37):**  a diverse portfolio in that way.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:26:40):**  And what do you see as most underrepresented or under, I wouldn't say funded or under  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:26:46):**  invested, but most overlooked in the conversations you have, let's say, with the financial world?  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:26:50):**  Is that the biodiversity or is that beyond carbon piece or the other pieces?  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:26:55):**  Maybe it's the oceans or the mangroves or the insects in general.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:26:58):**  What do you see as most neglected in this phase at the moment?  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:01):**  I mean, you've mentioned a lot of key ones.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:05):**  I do think that the...  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:06):**  If you had to pick one.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:07):**  Yeah, if I had to pick one.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:09):**  Like your favorite neglected pet.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:12):**  I mean, I would say biodiversity and people from the restore perspective, we have more  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:17):**  to bring to the table in terms of bringing biodiversity into the conversation and ensuring  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:23):**  that that isn't overlooked.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:25):**  But it's equally as important to think about people and who owns land, who has traditionally  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:30):**  managed land, how do they contribute?  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:33):**  And so for me, those are things that are beginning to enter the conversation more and more.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:38):**  There's often a lot of lip service and then perhaps not the follow through in terms of  
**[0:27:43-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:43):**  funding.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:44):**  But I think that there are steps being taken down the path to center the biodiversity and  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:51):**  people part in addition to the carbon part.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:54):**  And I hope that we continue to take those steps really purposefully and that investors  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:27:58):**  are a really important piece of making that path really walkable in the longterm.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:28:04):**  And what do you see the role?  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:28:06):**  I mean, how much are you already asking those questions when projects are registering and  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:28:11):**  filling out the data, etc.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:28:13):**  On the people side, are you asking those questions already?  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:28:16):**  And if not, how would you do that?  
**[0:28:17-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:28:17):**  Or when will that come?  
**[0:28:19-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:28:19):**  Yeah, so we have some required and some optional self disclosed information that include social  
**[0:28:28-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:28:28):**  aspects around land tenure, around ownership and management of particular projects.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:28:36):**  And we want to make it both easier for projects to fill out that information.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:28:42):**  That's really just a user experience challenge from our perspective so that we are collecting  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:28:47):**  that data from more and more projects, but also incentivize the sharing of that information.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:28:53):**  So we've been thinking about how we might include transparency ratings, for example,  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:28:59):**  rather than a quality rating, which is not such an easy thing to compare when you have  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:03):**  an agroforestry project next to a massive forest restoration project.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:08):**  So we think that an important piece of what we're building is ultimately making it more  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:13):**  and more desirable to share more and more information, which allows us to be clearer  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:18):**  and clearer about how the social aspects as well as the other pieces of restoration are  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:24):**  visible.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:25):**  Yeah, because especially land ownership can be very sensitive, very interesting, but I  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:31):**  can also imagine maybe prohibitive of people sharing if they have to fill it out.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:36):**  But yeah, how do you still tease it out?  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:38):**  Because it's such an essential piece of the restoration movement, and a very often overlooked  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:42):**  one.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:43):**  Exactly.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:44):**  So right now we haven't required land ownership as a prerequisite for putting a project on  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:52):**  Restore for a few reasons.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:54):**  One is simply the practicality of being able to verify that and the reality that there  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:29:58):**  is so much land tenure conflict in many parts of the world.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:02):**  But the other is often restoration projects are really the coming together of many different  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:08):**  actors, right?  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:09):**  There might be a larger landscape with many small farmers who are brought together through  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:13):**  cooperatives and then you have NGOs and government agencies who are funding.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:17):**  And so there's no one quote unquote manager of that project.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:22):**  It's a big collaborative effort.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:23):**  And so right now, really on an ad hoc basis, we've addressed particular concerns that have  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:29):**  come up about projects that have been put on the platform without perhaps the knowledge  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:34):**  of one of the actors.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:35):**  And we've made it easy for projects to have multiple managers so that you can really bring  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:40):**  in that multi-stakeholder effort, that as we grow, we will have to continue to formalize  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:45):**  the way that we address any potential concerns around the ownership and management of a particular  
**[0:30:51-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:51):**  site.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:52):**  And this might be a good segue to a question I always like to ask.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:56):**  If there was one thing, it might have to do with land tenure, maybe absolutely not.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:30:59):**  But if there would be one thing you could change overnight, so you have a magic wand  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:31:03):**  and you've only one wish, unfortunately, what would that be?  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:31:07):**  Could be in the restoration movement, could be anywhere else as well.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:31:10):**  But what would you change?  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:31:13):**  Thinking about your work and your space in the regenerative agriculture movement, it  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:31:18):**  strikes me that farmers are risk averse, right?  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:31:23):**  And for good reason, because implementing change at the farm level takes time.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:31:29):**  I think if I could wave a magic wand, I would take away the risks that farmers face so that  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:31:39):**  behavior change could come more quickly.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:31:43):**  And parts of that is just funding that transition, right?  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:31:46):**  From going from traditional agriculture to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:31:50):**  And some of it is about opening up, I think, farmer minds to being able to think about  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:31:56):**  change.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:31:57):**  And I say that with deep respect for decades and centuries of farmer knowledge that have  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:32:03):**  built practices.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:32:04):**  But that's a piece that I keep coming back to is how do we help with this transition  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:32:10):**  that is so complicated from a management perspective and from a behavior perspective?  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:32:15):**  And in terms of restore, and let's say the agriculture side, what are you most looking  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:32:20):**  forward to bring on where the beginning of the year, like this year in 2022, on the agriculture  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:32:25):**  side, are there any exciting things coming or anything to you, obviously, if you're comfortable  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:32:30):**  sharing things that you're looking forward to, let's say on the ag piece?  
**[0:32:34-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:32:34):**  We've had some exciting conversations with, and I won't name specific names, but organizations  
**[0:32:41-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:32:41):**  and companies who are connected to many, many small farmers and who are trying to support  
**[0:32:48-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:32:48):**  farmers and bring better wages, better compensation to farmers for their environmental and social  
**[0:32:55-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:32:55):**  practices.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:32:56):**  I'm really excited about working to get larger groups of farmers onto the restore platform,  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:33:02):**  both so that we can think about the ways in which perhaps additional compensation through  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:33:07):**  carbon credits or others could supplement income that they have today through the sale  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:33:12):**  of the products that they're producing.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:33:15):**  And also so that more broadly, we all, and I use we very broadly here, can learn from  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:33:22):**  the work that's happening in the farmer space and we can inspire more and more farmers to  
**[0:33:27-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:33:27):**  change the way that they're practicing.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:33:29):**  So I know there's a little bit of vagueness there, but ultimately, as I say, restoration  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:33:34):**  includes sustainable agriculture and the umbrella that that represents.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:33:40):**  And so the more we can highlight that and make that visible and also reward those farmers  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:33:46):**  who are doing that work, the better for all of us and the more we can expand what we think  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:33:51):**  of as the restoration movement.  
**[0:33:52-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:33:52):**  And do you see that the vision that sometimes I feel that that's quite clear on like the  
**[0:34:00-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:00):**  restoring nature movement and let's say the regenerative or agroecology or sustainable  
**[0:34:07-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:07):**  agriculture movement, they don't always seem to talk.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:09):**  Do you see that often in the projects you work with, or as they're often landscapes  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:14):**  or larger pieces that often they include both?  
**[0:34:17-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:17):**  Or is it a very divided space?  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:20):**  The restoration one, like one side is growing food and the other side is trying to restore?  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:24):**  Yeah, I do think that it tends to be divided or it has historically been divided.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:29):**  And there's many, many reasons for that.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:31):**  There's sort of traditional Western views of what conservation and kind of restoring  
**[0:34:36-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:36):**  to a quote unquote natural state look like.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:39):**  And those are often in contrast to what it means to have restoration in the context of  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:44):**  producing food and supporting people.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:47):**  And so I think that those historical divides have meant that there's sort of different  
**[0:34:52-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:52):**  directions and the broader restoration space.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:56):**  I do think, you mentioned landscape scale restoration.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:34:59):**  I think that that really helps to bring together a bigger picture of how these things connect.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:35:05):**  And I hope that by bringing these many different kinds of projects together in one place, that  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:35:11):**  as Restore we can help raise awareness about both the interconnectivity and the nuance  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:35:16):**  and the great diversity of what it means to be able to restore and the many, many different  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:35:21):**  reasons why restoration is important for climate, for people, for biodiversity.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:35:27):**  And if there was one thing you could wish for, like in terms of technical ability, would  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:35:31):**  that be a special satellite or be a really good data set on biodiversity, like on the  
**[0:35:36-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:35:36):**  restore perspective, what would really help you?  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:35:39):**  What isn't possible yet or maybe completely unaffordable?  
**[0:35:43-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:35:43):**  What would you wish for if you could choose something in the shop with that pay?  
**[0:35:46-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:35:46):**  I would love to be able to, I guess, skip over all of the development work that I mentioned  
**[0:35:52-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:35:52):**  bioacoustics.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:35:53):**  So it's on my mind that if we could skip over all of the development work that still needs  
**[0:35:56-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:35:56):**  to happen and we could simply say, OK, with your existing smartphone, download this app,  
**[0:36:03-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:03):**  stand out here, record, put it on restore, done.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:06):**  If we could kind of skip the development that's still needed, I think that would just be an  
**[0:36:10-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:10):**  incredible gift to the restoration movement.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:15):**  And I think it's I've seen I have to look there's an American artist on the soundscaping  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:20):**  side that has done some very interesting and of course, the name doesn't pop into my mind  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:25):**  now, but as I put it in the show notes below, some very interesting work on showing the  
**[0:36:29-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:29):**  soundscapes basically of forests, intact ones, even some of them have selectively been cut.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:36):**  And the difference in sound like the forest seems the same, but the difference in sound  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:39):**  is stunning, like the quantity, the quality, the diversity, et cetera.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:44):**  You can hear the difference, but not see the difference, which is very, very interesting,  
**[0:36:47-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:47):**  obviously, from an investor perspective as well.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:49):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:50):**  And there's so much incredible work, right?  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:53):**  That's already happened in this space.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:36:55):**  And so really, it's about figuring out what are the pieces that we can pull together to  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:00):**  make it accessible, to make it scalable, to overcome the hurdles around the analytics  
**[0:37:05-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:05):**  of all of it.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:06):**  But it's not like we're starting from zero.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:08):**  No, luckily not, luckily not.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:10):**  And then of course, we have to map and compare and baseline and all of that.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:14):**  So that's an extremely... and do you feel we're close to that?  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:18):**  Like if we have this conversation in a year from now, have we made a lot of progress with  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:22):**  the acoustic side of things and the biodiversity side?  
**[0:37:25-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:25):**  I do think so.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:26):**  Yeah, we're going to be piloting, I mean, again, many people around the world are doing  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:31):**  this work, and we're trying to just build upon the incredible work that's already happened  
**[0:37:35-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:35):**  so far.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:36):**  We'll be piloting that work with a number of projects this year, we'll be piloting the  
**[0:37:40-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:40):**  integration of that onto the Restore platform.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:44):**  So I think that by the end of the year, we'll have the beginnings of what it looks like  
**[0:37:48-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:48):**  for anyone to be able to upload an audio file and get some basic information from Restore  
**[0:37:55-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:55):**  about what that area looks like.  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:57):**  Wow, that's extremely exciting.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:37:58):**  I'll definitely be checking in.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:01):**  And I want to thank you so much for your time and for sharing this early journey.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:05):**  I mean, it's a year, which is a lot and nothing at the same time, going from one person to  
**[0:38:09-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:09):**  12, obviously.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:11):**  But it seems like there's a lot of momentum behind it.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:13):**  And I'm very much looking forward to follow it over time.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:17):**  And also what this means for agriculture, for agroforestry, for ocean farming, and then  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:22):**  all of the pieces of this globe that have to be restored.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:25):**  Well, thanks so much for having me, Koon.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:27):**  Yeah, I'm very, very excited about continuing to bring together these narratives of more  
**[0:38:33-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:33):**  traditional forest nature restoration and, you know, agroecology and the agriculture  
**[0:38:37-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:37):**  space.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:38):**  And I think that these kind of conversations are a really terrific opportunity to help  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:42):**  bring those worlds closer.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:43):**  Yeah, they're definitely not separate as we, we, I'm saying in the global north, have thought  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:48):**  for a long time that's nature in one corner, big fence around it, and it will be okay.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:53):**  And agriculture somewhere else and cities somewhere else.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:55):**  It's all a flux and a continuum.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:38:59):**  If you found the investing in regenerative agriculture and food podcast valuable, there

**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:39:43):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:39:47):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:39:52-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:39:52):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:39:56-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:39:56):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:39:57):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:01):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:06):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:11):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:40:14-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:14):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:40:16-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:16):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:18):**  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:21):**  What questions should you ask?  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:23):**  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:40:24-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:24):**  What should you read?  
**[0:40:25-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:25):**  What should you listen?  
**[0:40:26-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:26):**  What should you watch?  
**[0:40:28-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:28):**  How to approach this space?  
**[0:40:30-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:30):**  For whom is this course?  
**[0:40:32-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:32):**  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:34):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:39):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:44):**  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:49):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:51):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:40:54-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:54):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:40:59):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:04):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:41:05-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:05):**  No.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:06):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:08):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:13):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:18):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:41:23-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:23):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:26):**  Thank you.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:27):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:41:28-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:28):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:34):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:36):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:41:41-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:41):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:41:47-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:47):**  invest in and what kind of co investors you could find or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:51):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:53):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:41:58):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:42:02):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:42:06):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:42:08-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:42:08):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clara-rowe#t=0:42:09):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.

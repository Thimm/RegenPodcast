**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:13):**  This interview is all about nutrient density and how the scientific advisor of Chef Dan  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:18):**  Barber has been focused on the connection between healthy soils, healthy food and healthy  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:23):**  people for the last 25 years.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:28):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:32):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:37):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:42):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:48):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:50):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:54):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small  
**[0:00:59-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:00:59):**  and consumers, start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:06):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:10):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:14):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:18):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:22):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:27):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:31):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:36):**  support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:38):**  For more information please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:43):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:46):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:47):**  So welcome to another great episode.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:50):**  Today I'm joined by Jill Clepperton, founder of Rizotera.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:53):**  Rizotera is an international company based in the Pacific Northwest region of the US  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:01:58):**  that's devoted to creating information and knowledge to assist farmers, ranchers and  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:02):**  land managers in their quest to create healthy, productive soils.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:06):**  And it's all for the love of food, which obviously I enjoy a lot.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:09):**  Welcome Jill!  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:10):**  Thank you!  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:11):**  It's a pleasure to be here.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:13):**  And can you tell, because you've told your amazing background story already to me, but  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:17):**  can you tell to the audience why you're doing what you're doing, why you're so focused and  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:22):**  actually for quite a few years already on soil?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:25):**  Well, yeah, okay.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:27):**  So my background is I started my career with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada as the Risesphere  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:36):**  ecologist.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:37):**  So the Risesphere is the rooting zone.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:40):**  So it's the root, the soil attached to the root and the soil that's actually influenced  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:44):**  by the root.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:45):**  And what I love about that is it's a whole system look.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:48):**  So I am looking at everything that affects plant growth and how plants affect everything  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:54):**  below ground as well.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:55):**  So it's this beautiful whole systems approach.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:02:59):**  And what I learned when I was there was that, you know, we can actually influence the soils,  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:06):**  we can create and build wonderful soils and plants are the most critical part of that.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:12):**  And then we started experimenting more with different kinds of plants and cover crops  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:16):**  and companions and diverse cropping rotations.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:19):**  And what we found was that when just wildly, and I would say wildly, I had this idea that  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:26):**  maybe we should, you know, analyze the grain.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:29):**  And so we had to do a lot of work.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:30):**  My technician, she had to work really hard to ramp up the analysis so we could actually  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:36):**  do this.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:37):**  And what we found was that when we integrated diverse cropping systems, we had this change  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:45):**  in the nutrient density within the wheat, within our four year rotation.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:50):**  And when was this?  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:51):**  Because this sounds almost, I wouldn't say normal now, I mean, at least in the region  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:03:56):**  X space, it sort of starts to become accepted, let's say nutrient density, the connection  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:01):**  to healthy soil.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:02):**  But I'm guessing that this has been, it wasn't last week.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:05):**  I know it was really we started the study in 1997.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:13):**  Wow.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:15):**  And it took me a really long time.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:18):**  It didn't take me a long time.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:19):**  But I really had to convince everybody to even have a go.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:24):**  And you know, pushing that, honestly, I have always thought that it was my job to be 20  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:32):**  years ahead of everyone, the farmers, not my research partners, but and my research  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:38):**  colleagues, but to be 20 years ahead of the farmers so that when they got there 20 years  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:43):**  later, I already had the answers.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:46):**  I had practice for them.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:49):**  I knew how to do some of these things, so that when they're ready, the information was  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:55):**  there to help them so they didn't have to try and develop that themselves.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:04:59):**  So that was my goal.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:02):**  And so we did this work.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:05):**  And it was really interesting because this was the first organic research study in Ag  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:11):**  Canada.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:13):**  And so what we did was I was trying to integrate no-till into organic agriculture is really  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:18):**  what I was doing.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:19):**  And so we had, I mean, we had four replicates of every treatment in there, including this  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:26):**  one with integrated livestock.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:28):**  And I remember the first meeting.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:30):**  The first meeting was amazing because I had these organic farmers and I had the conventional  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:36):**  farmers and some of the people from the commodity groups and stuff.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:39):**  And we were all sitting at the table.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:40):**  And I felt like I was mediating a labor dispute.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:44):**  I mean, it was like, I can do anything that you can do as long as I can do it my way.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:49):**  And I'll put my yields against yours any day.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:52):**  And it was like, oh, my gosh.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:05:54):**  And it got like people yelling across the table and a lot of passion and a lot of energy.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:00):**  And there started to be anger.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:01):**  And so I said, okay, everybody outside, taking a break, everybody out.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:07):**  And they all went outside.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:08):**  It was a nice day.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:09):**  So they all went outside and had a drink and everything.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:12):**  And then they were talking more casually because we were at a round table.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:16):**  And they came back in and they had the answer.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:19):**  I mean, they had, we'd been sitting there for like two hours with people yelling and  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:23):**  arguing and they all went outside and they came back and we have the answer.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:27):**  But we can't do it in a normal scientific way.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:29):**  And that was a hard sell for me because what they want is, well, we'll have an organic  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:34):**  rotation and we'll have a non-organic rotation and we'll have them side by side.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:39):**  So we'll have simple, which is wheat fallow against wheat with an under seeding of sweet  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:45):**  clover and then a sweet clover year.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:48):**  And then the next one we'll have like a four year rotation and we'll have crops in the  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:52):**  sequence that we want them in organic.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:55):**  And you guys will have, you know, crops in the sequence that you think's okay.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:06:59):**  And then we'll go into one that's really wild.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:02):**  And I said, well, that one has to have integrated livestock grazing.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:07):**  Okay.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:08):**  Well, we'll have a year of, it'll be a cover, but it will also be a forage for livestock  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:11):**  grazing.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:12):**  And those two were pretty much the same.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:14):**  And then the last one was continuous wheat with full inputs, but not full in the normal  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:21):**  way.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:22):**  It was in a way that was measured.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:25):**  So we said, we're only going to put in what we think we really need.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:29):**  And what was the difficulty for the science part, which you mentioned?  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:33):**  Why was that so difficult to capture?  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:36):**  Because the rotations weren't exactly partnered.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:42):**  You see that they weren't exactly the same.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:44):**  So you couldn't read the variables.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:45):**  There were too many variables.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:48):**  They weren't exactly the same.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:49):**  So I think ideally it would have been wheat fallow, wheat fallow, and we would have partnered  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:52):**  that with organic, but you can't grow organics that way.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:56):**  You can't.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:57):**  I mean, what would I do?  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:07:58):**  I mean, I can't spray weeds.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:00):**  I would have to do a lot of tillage.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:01):**  And my goal was to do no tillage at all.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:04):**  So as a scientist and scientists are reductionists and we like to do statistics and that made  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:10):**  the statistics very hard, but I came from ecology and a PhD in plant physiology.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:16):**  Which is not about producing.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:18):**  Which means that I can never have a true replicate.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:21):**  I mean, if I'm in a natural ecosystem, where's the true replicate?  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:24):**  Where does it exist?  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:25):**  It doesn't.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:27):**  So I mean, I can go from, I could take a step and it's different again.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:34):**  And the same in range ecology, if it's really natural range, every step I take, it's going  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:38):**  to be different.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:39):**  And it's very true from an underground situation.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:42):**  I can move an inch and it could be different.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:44):**  I can move a centimeter and it will be different.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:47):**  So what we had to do then was go back and go, okay, I'm going to use ecological statistics  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:53):**  to analyze the study.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:55):**  And that means I'm not going to have true replicates.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:56):**  I'm going to have what's called pseudo replicates.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:08:59):**  And people in agriculture hate that.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:01):**  I mean, scientists and that they hate it because most of the statisticians in agriculture are  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:09):**  breeders.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:10):**  And they have like 12 replicates and they have all, you know, 12 replicates of everything  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:16):**  because that gives them a better power test and all these things that, you know, in ecology,  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:21):**  there's no way I'm going to do all that.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:22):**  In fact, I'm incapable of doing it even with the team of graduate students.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:27):**  So it's like, no, I can't do that.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:29):**  So I had to do a lot of convincing to the statisticians and I had to do a lot of convincing  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:35):**  to my fellow scientists who were going to work with us on this.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:40):**  And in the end, they all bought in and we had 12 scientists working on it.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:42):**  We had tons of data and we went for 12 years.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:49):**  And it was an amazing experience.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:55):**  And we generated a lot of interesting things.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:09:58):**  But it was every year was a sell because every year was like, oh, my gosh, like, well, what  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:04):**  if the cows get out?  
**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:05):**  They'll ruin all these breeding trials.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:07):**  And because, you know, one might actually like leave a cow patty in something and will  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:13):**  change the nutrition.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:14):**  And that's a really bad thing.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:16):**  But what's important about that for me, looking back now in saying that is that we had already  
**[0:10:24-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:24):**  recognized the value of manure and the value of cattle.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:27):**  Like they were going to change the nutrition of that crop and that was going to ruin my  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:32):**  experiment.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:34):**  And so if you think about that now, you're like, whoa, we knew that and we know how important  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:39):**  that was 20 plus years ago.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:42):**  And so then so then we say, holy henna, here we are.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:48):**  We have we have got this organic paired experiment.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:53):**  We are analyzing new we're actually analyzing nutrient density.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:10:59):**  We did that in the second year of the study.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:01):**  And we only analyzed everything for years.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:03):**  So we finished the whole rotation and we had four reps of everything before we went through.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:09):**  Now what happened in that study that also changed the course of my career and my life  
**[0:11:15-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:15):**  was that we because we were replicating everything every year, we had every treatment and every  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:23):**  rotation every year.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:25):**  So we started to build up a population of sweet clover weevils because we were feeding  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:30):**  them every year.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:33):**  Like which no farmer would ever do.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:36):**  And so I also realized that when we set up these experiments, they have a really they  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:41):**  have this other value of showing up all the things that you do wrong if you do monoculture  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:46):**  and you do the same thing over and over and over again.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:49):**  Because when I did it over and over again, it only took four years for me to have sweet  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:53):**  clover weevils that ruined my experiment because now the sweet clover didn't work anymore to  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:11:57):**  control weeds because I didn't have any because the weevils had eaten it all.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:03):**  And then we had we didn't we didn't get a competitive crop one year on the canola.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:09):**  And then I had like thistles, like Canadian thistles that, you know, defied any kind of  
**[0:12:17-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:17):**  management.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:18):**  And it's like, OK, well, I guess we're doing tillage and we're going to learn how to manage  
**[0:12:21-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:21):**  thistles in a different way.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:23):**  And the lesson in that was, you know, build a competitive crop.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:27):**  But it didn't matter.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:28):**  Every year I had a field day.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:30):**  Every two years I had a field day so that people could come out and see what we were  
**[0:12:34-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:34):**  doing.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:35):**  And and it didn't matter.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:36):**  I mean, I had sisters and everybody like, oh, my gosh, that's a really big mess.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:39):**  And I was like, yeah, it's a mess.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:41):**  So how are we going to solve that mess, guys?  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:43):**  Like what are we going to do here?  
**[0:12:44-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:44):**  How do we manage this?  
**[0:12:45-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:45):**  And and here's how we got there.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:47):**  But now we have a mess and this is a problem.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:50):**  Now we have weevils.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:51):**  But, you know, one of the coolest things that happened in that with a field day was we were  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:12:58):**  we had wheat, sweet clover and organics.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:02):**  So we sowed the wheat and we undersowed sweet clover in there.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:06):**  And those sweet clover grew up and grew underneath the wheat.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:09):**  And then the next year we had a sweet clover year and we had no weeds in the organics.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:16):**  Which is quite, quite unique.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:20):**  And we had beautiful wheat.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:24):**  We had always made protein.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:26):**  So we were always over 14 percent.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:28):**  And we had the same yields as we did in the conventional.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:31):**  And my yields were always with the county average.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:34):**  So it was always fine.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:37):**  And I remember somebody thinking, you know, so some of the people in the group said, you  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:44):**  know, give us the map.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:46):**  You're showing us this.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:47):**  But we don't know if they're really the organic plots.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:50):**  So can you give us a map?  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:51):**  And we said, here's the map.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:54):**  And they walked off, you know, so it's like, OK, we're having a break right now.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:13:58):**  And everybody walked off with the maps and went and checked out.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:01):**  You know, so it's a good you know, they I said, you're going to have to share maps because  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:04):**  I didn't bring maps for like 80 people.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:07):**  So off you go.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:09):**  And they walked and they measured and they said, you have a tape measure?  
**[0:14:12-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:12):**  And we went back to the truck and like pulled out the tape measure.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:15):**  And they measured from the corner to make sure that we weren't lying to them.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:19):**  That's how far our little trust is in the system.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:24):**  Wow.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:26):**  So then they measured to make sure that we weren't lying about this being an organic  
**[0:14:29-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:29):**  plot.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:31):**  And after they measured everything and and were clear, we were good from then on.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:36):**  And the world of research, which you spent quite a bit of time in, what made you decide  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:42):**  to leave that world of, let's say, research and move to almost the applied research side  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:48):**  of things to work directly with farmers, to start your own company, basically to work  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:52):**  directly with farmers, with ranchers, with landowners?  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:14:55):**  What was that trigger and why did you decide to start Rise of Terror?  
**[0:15:00-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:00):**  So Dr. Ross Welsh, who was the director of the ARS Research Center at Cornell in the  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:09):**  United States, became a friend and a mentor.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:13):**  He was an amazing mentor for me.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:17):**  And he was very interested in nutrient density.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:19):**  I mean, that's what he did.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:21):**  I mean, he was very interested in soils and nutrient density.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:25):**  And he had written books on the subject and worked in all these countries building nutrient  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:30):**  dense food and understanding the relationship with disease.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:34):**  And he was working with a breeder like Robin Graham from Australia and really understood  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:39):**  it.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:40):**  And I said to him, I said, the rhizosphere is where it's at.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:41):**  And it's not about we need to work with breeders, but we also need to really build soils.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:47):**  And then I think I can optimize almost any genetics if I can do this.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:53):**  So we were having that discussion.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:15:57):**  And he was visiting for the field day.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:01):**  And the field day was really well attended.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:02):**  But then we had a public lecture, and I had 15 people at the public lecture with this  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:06):**  man that knew more about nutrient density than anything.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:10):**  And I was like, shocked.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:15):**  And that was in the early 2000s.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:19):**  And I was talking to Russ, we went hiking in Waterton National Park, and we were hiking  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:23):**  together.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:25):**  And I said to him, you know, we're going through a transition at Ag Canada.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:30):**  And they want me to move and they want me to do more of earthworm taxonomy.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:36):**  Because I was at that time, was very well known in Canada for founding the Worm Watch  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:41):**  program, which is a very successful program, citizen science program, on having people  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:48):**  monitor earthworm populations and whatnot.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:53):**  And they were changing from multidisciplinary studies to more single studies.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:16:58):**  And they wanted to take the emphasis off of applied research and put it more on pure research.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:04):**  And I spoke to him, I said, you know, I really know what to do here.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:08):**  And he said to me, he said, Well, Jill, I'm going to retire soon.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:15):**  And I've written all these books, and I've authored all these papers, and it doesn't  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:18):**  matter.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:19):**  He said, it doesn't matter.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:22):**  He said, what really matters is that somebody implements what you're saying and what the  
**[0:17:27-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:27):**  researcher is doing.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:28):**  And he said, I don't think anybody's implemented anything that I've ever done.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:32):**  And he said, so now as I approach 65, I'm thinking about doing I'm doing all this extension  
**[0:17:37-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:37):**  work, which he said, I'm, you know, sort of good at but not really to try and, and promote  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:45):**  what I think is really important.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:47):**  And he said, you are way ahead of me on that.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:49):**  Like he said, you all these farmers, you're here at this field day, and they're following  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:53):**  what you're doing, and they, they want you to do more and they, they are implementing  
**[0:17:58-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:17:58):**  what you're talking about in their fields.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:00):**  And it's making a difference.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:01):**  He said, you can't stop.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:03):**  So you can't stop doing this because it's too important.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:07):**  And I said, Well, I don't know how I'm going to keep going.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:09):**  You know, I'm gonna take a break and do these things.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:12):**  And he said, Well, why don't you quit?  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:15):**  And I just about thought I was gonna fall, I just felt like fall off the trail.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:19):**  And you know, like, what, what's easy for you to say you had your whole career and,  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:24):**  and you've done all these things, you know, and and now and you're gonna have this pension  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:28):**  and all this other stuff.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:30):**  And you're asking me halfway through my career to like, walk away.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:35):**  And you think it's a good idea.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:36):**  And he said, Well, it's either that or try and convince everybody to do something else.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:42):**  And he said, but I think you need another job, like one that really uses your skills,  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:48):**  and where you can use your skills.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:50):**  And I went and talked to my financial advisor.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:54):**  And he said, you know, I think you'd be a great entrepreneur.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:18:57):**  Is it really I know nothing.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:00):**  And he said, No, I really think that you would be.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:03):**  And so I was with the government, I could take a year off for personal leave.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:10):**  And I did.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:11):**  And when I came back, I resigned.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:14):**  And when was this?  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:15):**  And that was in 2007.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:19):**  And then you were searching for customers farmers to work with?  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:23):**  Where did you start?  
**[0:19:24-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:24):**  Or how did you?  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:25):**  Well, I didn't have to search very long because, but you know, people weren't using used to  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:29):**  paying for that kind of stuff.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:31):**  So it was a little tough, rough at the beginning, because people like, we don't normally pay  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:37):**  for this.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:38):**  And they were like, they're expecting it for free, because I'd always been free because  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:42):**  I worked for the government.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:43):**  So it was and it was hard for me to ask for money, because I love doing what I do so much  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:48):**  that I was like, I wanted to do it all for free.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:50):**  Like, I wanted to do it all for free.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:53):**  But that's impossible.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:19:55):**  I can't live and feed my family and send my son to school if I don't get paid.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:02):**  And it was a bit rough on everybody.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:03):**  So they're like, Oh, my gosh, like, but, you know, there were a lot of farmers that really  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:11):**  supported me in that venture.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:14):**  And we're willing to, you know, pay for a little time, get me studies, like where I  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:19):**  did research studies, where I was a contractor on research studies and whatnot.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:24):**  And I managed to get going my first.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:28):**  So my first company was not rise of Tara, it was Earth Spirit Consulting.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:33):**  And I still have that company, it's my Canadian company.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:36):**  And then it was really obvious for me that in the States, I had more opportunity.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:41):**  I think I have the opportunity now in Canada, but it was we still had even though they have  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:48):**  a lot of extension in states and whatnot.  
**[0:20:51-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:20:51):**  I think it was still an opportunity for me to have a company and in a different way.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:01):**  And I had more I did have more opportunity there.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:06):**  So and the universities were more into it, like, you know, having an ad company and a  
**[0:21:13-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:13):**  consulting company and things like that.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:15):**  So and I feel like now we've just kind of tipped, like really tipped where people are  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:22):**  ready to pay for advice.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:24):**  I mean, I did a lot of research experiments for companies and things like that.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:29):**  I tested a lot of varieties.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:30):**  I introduced new varieties with riso Tara into the Pacific Northwest.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:34):**  And there's a lot of farmers, you know, growing winter wheat that probably wouldn't have grown  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:38):**  winter wheat if they hadn't been on my field days.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:42):**  So I really feel like I've been very, very lucky.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:47):**  Well, I don't feel that way.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:49):**  I know I've been very lucky.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:51):**  And I've worked with great farmers and people who really believed in taking the change,  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:56):**  like being the change.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:21:58):**  And we were the change.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:00):**  And I can see it changing.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:02):**  I mean, I was during that time, it went through riso Tara.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:10):**  I did a number of workshops in Oregon for Oregon State University.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:15):**  And they were measuring, you know, the adoption rate of what we talked about.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:20):**  And what was really interesting, they said, well, we don't know if we don't think we've  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:23):**  succeeded because there was only 3% adoption rate, like full adoption rate of change.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:29):**  And they thought that was terrible.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:30):**  I was doing the happy dance.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:32):**  Because to you, that's a lot.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:35):**  Yeah, because farmers take a long time to change.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:38):**  And in five years, that 3% of the farmers that we talked to, which really represented  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:44):**  about four or five farms, had made a full transition.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:50):**  That's huge.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:51):**  That's enormous.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:52):**  I mean, there's, I think there's a lot of research around tipping points, etc.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:22:56):**  And I think usually they put it somewhere, but it depends on the system and the complexity  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:00):**  and the variables.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:02):**  I think it's around 10 or 10 to 15 before a full system starts to switch.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:07):**  So three is a lot.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:09):**  You're like one third there, basically.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:12):**  And I thought that was just absolutely amazing.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:14):**  And I'm jumping around and they're thinking it's a failure because they I don't know if  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:18):**  they figured that they were going to get 90% or something like that.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:20):**  But if they were, holy, I mean, good grief.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:25):**  That for a farmer to change in five years, like, and if they change in five years, that  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:30):**  means they started immediately to make a transition.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:35):**  So there's probably a second group basically following that a few years later would be  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:39):**  similar.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:41):**  And so what do you now work on with your clients, with your customers, with your partners?  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:47):**  What is where you spend most of your time as riso Terra?  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:51):**  Well, right now.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:53):**  So welcome to the new year.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:23:57):**  We nutrient density has really taken off.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:02):**  So all that work that I did all those years ago, now people are going like, well, where  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:05):**  is that?  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:06):**  You know, like, I was like, well, I've got to revisit all that.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:12):**  And there was some stuff we didn't publish because nobody would publish it because it  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:15):**  was like too weird.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:16):**  Like an example of what was to win?  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:19):**  Well, some of it was like, why would you measure nutrient density?  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:22):**  That doesn't mean anything like so what if it changed?  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:24):**  Like you need to measure that over 20 years or something like that.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:27):**  And I was like, well, we measured it over four.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:30):**  Isn't that enough?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:31):**  Or like we measured over three.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:33):**  Isn't that enough?  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:34):**  And it was like, no, I mean, like if you're going to make a claim like that, you better  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:37):**  have measured it like over 20 years.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:40):**  And what kind of claims were you making?  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:42):**  Well, we showed.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:43):**  OK, so we showed that when we put a cover crop ahead of wheat, for example, because  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:50):**  that was where we went after we had the weevils.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:52):**  We had to develop more crops to go to under seed.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:55):**  So we started working on companions in the early like in 2003.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:24:59):**  We were working on companions.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:00):**  We were working on all that.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:02):**  Nobody was doing that.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:03):**  And that was also really weird.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:04):**  Like people like, oh, she's so weird.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:07):**  Like like like that's too weird.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:11):**  But what we showed when we were doing like testing all these different crops and putting  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:15):**  them all underneath wheat was that we could change the nutrient density in one season.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:20):**  Like obviously significantly.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:23):**  But what kind of levels are we talking about in terms of change?  
**[0:25:27-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:27):**  We could we could double zinc.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:30):**  That's zinc deficiencies.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:32):**  It's a huge issue around the world.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:35):**  And we were focusing on zinc because some of the nutritionists that I had met at a conference  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:40):**  in Tufts when I met Ross Welch, they said to me, said, well, measuring quality is really,  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:46):**  really hard.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:47):**  I mean, it is outstandingly hard.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:50):**  And they will tell you that again today, that measuring quality, nutritional quality is  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:57):**  like something they don't know.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:25:58):**  It's sort of like measuring soil health and soil quality.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:01):**  So you need a proxy, basically.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:04):**  And I said, well, OK, so Ross said to me, he said, OK, here are the important elements.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:09):**  Zinc and, you know, from a malnutrition standpoint in the world, zinc, iron, beta carotene, so  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:17):**  vitamin A.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:18):**  So he said, if you focus on those three, you know, that will make a huge difference.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:26):**  And we couldn't really measure vitamins very well.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:29):**  So and they were expensive and we didn't have the money because obviously I was doing really  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:33):**  weird things.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:34):**  So it's not like I was like super well funded.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:37):**  And so we but we could measure nutrient density because we had this ICP for measuring all  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:42):**  these other things.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:43):**  So we were measuring nutrients.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:45):**  And we could see that in our four year rotations, like even when we took the fallow out and  
**[0:26:51-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:51):**  just added a legume for one year, we doubled the mineral nutrient density in the grain,  
**[0:26:57-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:57):**  in the wheat.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:26:58):**  We doubled it.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:00):**  And so we could say at that point, and I have said this publicly, that if you're growing  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:05):**  a wheat fallow, wheat fallow, your grain is rubbish.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:08):**  They probably didn't like that.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:09):**  No, they didn't like that.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:10):**  But I had the data to show it.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:11):**  I mean, I could prove it.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:12):**  I can put it up on the screen for you and you can see that you don't have the calcium.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:17):**  You don't have the potassium.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:18):**  You don't have any of that.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:19):**  It's terrible.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:20):**  And does the wheat look the same?  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:22):**  Like if I would have two plots of land with like a little road in between just.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:27):**  It looks the same, but it's absolutely not the same.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:30):**  It's absolutely not the same.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:32):**  If I eat this one, I get what I need.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:35):**  If I eat this one over here, I mean, no, I have to eat like three times more of it, four  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:39):**  times more of it, and I didn't even get the nutrition, which is what Ross had taught me.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:44):**  You know, like we can grow bushels and bushels and bushels, but is it just calories or is  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:49):**  it actually good for me?  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:51):**  And this is the central, I mean, you were mentioning 2020, new year.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:27:56):**  And I think it's going to be one of the central themes in ag and food in this decade.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:01):**  Like this wheat, although it seems the same or this tomato is not the same as its neighbor.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:06):**  No, it's not.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:07):**  It could be fundamentally different depending on obviously even variety, et cetera.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:11):**  But let's say they're the same.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:12):**  It depends on management, soil health and what happened underneath.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:15):**  Totally.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:16):**  It totally depends on your management.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:18):**  And my great growers in South, the great growers that I've worked with and know in South Africa  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:24):**  will tell you that when they started growing cover crops between the vines, they knew it  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:28):**  was going to change everything.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:29):**  I mean, they knew, right?  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:31):**  It changes the terroir.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:34):**  It changes it.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:35):**  The wine makers, I had the same discussion today on that the wine makers and wine people  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:40):**  have been very, very advanced in terms of marketing, in terms of terroir, in terms of  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:45):**  soil science, in terms of a lot of things, I think in agriculture, they've been the leading  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:51):**  edge of, and we should really look at how they have been doing that.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:28:54):**  And they know in coffee too, like in Guatemala, we saw, Hector saw that when he started putting  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:01):**  cover crops in, it was changing his coffee and the cupping of the coffee.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:07):**  And if we change the diversity, if we shift diversity a little bit, we change it again.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:13):**  So at Avondale Vineyard in Parle, South Africa, Jonathan had been really advanced in the cover  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:26):**  crops.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:27):**  He had covers between all the rows and he had a whole system and he had ducks eating  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:32):**  all his slugs and snails.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:35):**  And then he was marketing the ducks afterwards.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:38):**  And then he said that when he started doing this, and we were having a conversation one  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:42):**  night away from the workshop, and he said, you know, I started to see hyrax coming in,  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:47):**  like native rodents.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:48):**  And he said, and then one night I heard a civic cat.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:52):**  I said, we hadn't heard cats for years.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:54):**  And he said, I started to realize that it was growing an ecosystem.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:29:58):**  Like I was growing an agroecosystem.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:01):**  So then he did something revolutionary by all his agronomist standards.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:07):**  He went and let the native veld come back into his vines.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:12):**  What is a native veld?  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:13):**  Just for the unknown.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:14):**  A native veld are the native small shrubs.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:17):**  Like it's native plant vegetation that would have been there.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:21):**  So and these trees, most of these plants are melaleuca.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:24):**  So that means that they are like tea tree related.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:26):**  So they have a very strong, well, it's like rooibos too.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:32):**  I mean, very strong.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:34):**  The roots exude a lot of interesting things.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:38):**  And he knew it would really change.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:40):**  What happened to the wine?  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:41):**  The wine was amazing.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:42):**  He created these two wines that were from the native veld and we got to taste them at  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:47):**  the workshop.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:48):**  It was the first time he had cracked the bottles.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:50):**  And they were so complex.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:53):**  I mean, the flavors, the spiciness, the overtones.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:30:56):**  I mean, it was like nothing I'd ever tasted and nothing like anybody had ever tasted.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:04):**  And you know, and then he was partnering these wines with these ducks that had eaten in there  
**[0:31:08-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:08):**  and eaten all the, you know, and the whole story became and he called his wines au naturel.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:17):**  It became the story of au naturel, where everything was going natural, not everything, because  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:23):**  it became I can create these wines by just changing what grows between my rows.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:27):**  And I mean, you won't be focusing, I think, the whole year on wines.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:32):**  But what does that nutrient density for you mean now practically in terms of your work,  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:39):**  in terms of your week, your day to day, your months?  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:43):**  It means it's changed everything for me.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:44):**  Because now it's become where I was just really mentioning to people every now and again.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:51):**  And what now everybody's going, well, how do we do that?  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:53):**  Like, how do we get there?  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:55):**  I mean, and what does it mean?  
**[0:31:58-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:58):**  What does it mean for me?  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:31:59):**  And I because I met you personally, but before that, I saw you on Instagram stories of an  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:04):**  Instagram and a number of photos and a small video of Dan Barber, because you are the working  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:10):**  with Chef Barber, the scientific advisor of Chef Dan Barber, which most people know from  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:14):**  the Third Plate, I actually know quite some listeners of this podcast are in the space  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:18):**  because of the Third Plate.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:21):**  So what is how did that happen?  
**[0:32:23-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:23):**  And tell us more about nutrient density.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:25):**  That was magical.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:27):**  So I was at Climate Underground, sitting on a panel.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:32):**  And Dan was chairing that panel.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:36):**  So he was the moderator for the panel.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:39):**  And he was really challenging me.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:42):**  Like, you know, I have all these amazing chefs in my kitchen, and we can tell you what tasty  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:48):**  food is.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:49):**  And he said, if it's any good, he said, I think that if it's tasty, it's really good  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:53):**  for me.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:32:55):**  And I said, and he said, so, you know, he challenged me, he said, Well, you're measuring  
**[0:33:00-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:00):**  this, like, you know, what's the correlation?  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:02):**  I said, you know, I say, I don't know.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:07):**  And and he said, Well, can we measure it?  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:10):**  And I said, Well, I think, you know, we we'd have to work together, because I need to have  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:15):**  a tasting panel.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:16):**  And they'd have to say, you know, we'd have to have a few things out.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:19):**  And they'd have to say, Okay, this is the best tasting.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:21):**  And then we have to go and analyze it to see what if there were differences between them  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:26):**  to try and understand.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:27):**  And who's better than the chefs of Dan Barber, who probably has internal is better, right?  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:33):**  In terms of like his team, he and him and his team, probably in terms of tasting experience  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:39):**  are probably at the top in the world.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:41):**  But they're all about taste.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:42):**  I mean, their restaurants are all about tasty food.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:46):**  And Dan recognizes genetics are important.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:49):**  But I think that we can also optimize genetics with the way we do nutrients and whatnot.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:55):**  And I and I know from the work that we've done in the vineyards and in the coffee plantations  
**[0:33:59-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:33:59):**  that it makes a difference.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:00):**  Like, I mean, I don't think that vegetables are any different.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:04):**  And wheats any different than anything else.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:06):**  And so we analyzed all this wheat, like the Barber wheat from grown in four locations.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:11):**  So how did that happen?  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:12):**  So you're in the kitchen of Dan Barber with all these amazing chefs, including them Barber,  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:17):**  discussing nutrient density, and you have your tracer, which is just nutrient density  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:21):**  measuring gun between brackets.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:24):**  What was that experience like?  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:25):**  I mean, you can see some pictures, I will link that below in the show notes of the Instagram  
**[0:34:29-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:29):**  report, basically, that then Barber did.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:32):**  But how was that experience of being there measuring nutrient density?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:35):**  What did you measure?  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:36):**  How did you measure it?  
**[0:34:37-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:37):**  What was it like?  
**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:38):**  It was an incredibly exciting time.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:41):**  It was so fun to be with people who cared so much about food.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:47):**  I mean, cared so much about food and really, really love food.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:53):**  So first of all, we just started with the grains.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:56):**  I OK, Barber wheat.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:34:58):**  Yeah, because what's Barber wheat for anybody who didn't read?  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:01):**  Definitely should.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:02):**  But the third plate.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:04):**  So anyways, I was so we were sitting at the back of the kitchen and we set up this instrument  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:11):**  and we're all standing around and everybody's like, whoa.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:16):**  And it and it does look like a gun.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:19):**  So so we're getting ready to do all this analysis and everybody's standing around and we're  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:24):**  all really excited.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:25):**  Like, I'm excited, too.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:28):**  And and we it's like, well, what should we start with?  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:33):**  Well, I said anything, you know, we can just do everything.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:37):**  So that's what we did.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:38):**  I mean, it was pretty amazing because we were at the we were there at five o'clock.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:42):**  So it was after I'd done seminars all day.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:45):**  So the kitchen was busy.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:46):**  I mean, chefs running around, waitstaff running in and out.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:51):**  I mean, for me, it was amazing because I was actually in the kitchen and then they would  
**[0:35:54-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:54):**  just come over and hand me something.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:56):**  So let's measure this.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:35:57):**  And then we Dan and I'd be standing there talking and looking at the screen.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:02):**  It was fabulous.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:03):**  So anyways, Barbara Wheat is is just that it's Dan Barbara's wheat.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:09):**  It's a it's a variety of wheat.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:11):**  And and but he's also been having it grown in in four different places.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:16):**  So we had wheat in the bakery that had been grown in four different places.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:23):**  And so we took that grain, we ground it up in my coffee grinder because I need to have  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:27):**  it ground a little bit because we want to measure the whole density.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:31):**  So the one thing is, is that when you're measuring grains, I can this instrument will actually  
**[0:36:36-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:36):**  measure what's in the outside.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:37):**  And then if we can, we can measure in the inside.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:39):**  But if we want to measure the whole grain, because it in with those restaurants, you're  
**[0:36:44-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:44):**  actually measuring the whole grain.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:46):**  I mean, Dan's using whole grain flour, whole grains, fermenting whole grains.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:52):**  So we ground it up, measure it.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:54):**  And there was differences between all four places was grown.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:36:57):**  So the same variety, the same, but very different climate management, maybe even different rotations.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:05):**  You could see significant differences between those four types.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:08):**  Wow.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:09):**  Yes, we could in calcium and potassium and zinc and some of the iron and some of the  
**[0:37:14-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:14):**  other trace elements.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:16):**  So we're like, wow, okay, so, you know, so that's where you say, okay, maybe we blend  
**[0:37:21-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:21):**  it all.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:22):**  Or maybe we just have it grown here.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:24):**  Or maybe we talk to the people who are growing it somewhere else and then actually look at,  
**[0:37:28-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:28):**  well, how they're growing it.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:30):**  And maybe we change that so that we everything becomes more nutrient dense.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:35):**  Then we measured grass fed versus grain fed beef.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:39):**  And we at first, we didn't have the same cuts.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:41):**  And I said, well, that's not fair.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:43):**  I mean, we have to have exactly the same cut.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:46):**  Or you have to blend it again in your coffee blender.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:48):**  But I'm not sure if that's.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:50):**  So, you know, and we're like, no, I was like, so we had the same cut.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:54):**  And then we analyzed that and then we did fermented grains and then we analyzed bread.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:37:58):**  And then the last day I was there for three days and the last day we're like, well, maybe  
**[0:38:02-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:02):**  we could create whole meals.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:04):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:05):**  I saw that picture.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:06):**  That was fascinating.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:07):**  What happened there?  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:08):**  Well, so we blended them all up in a blender and I had the chefs running the instrument.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:14):**  So they were running the instrument.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:17):**  And they were, I said, okay, you know, it's instruments easy to run.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:20):**  So you guys run it.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:22):**  And we could see where we had more salt, like, you know, we could see the salt.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:27):**  We could see, I mean, we could see a lot of differences and then we could see the differences  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:31):**  between the meals.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:32):**  And they were like, well, well, how do we create that difference?  
**[0:38:36-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:36):**  And then how do we create this difference?  
**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:38):**  And then we started as well, what are the differences?  
**[0:38:41-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:41):**  So then it was like, okay, you know what?  
**[0:38:44-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:44):**  I'm going to have to analyze, I'm going to have to actually create a calibration for  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:47):**  pureed meals so that we can start to understand, you know, what the whole nutrient package  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:52):**  is if you eat this meal.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:53):**  Because that's the big difference.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:38:54):**  This tracer is a device, just to explain for people that haven't seen it, it's basically  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:00):**  about, let's say half a meter high, maybe with less on us, basically sticking up.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:05):**  So up from the table and you put whatever you're measuring, which could be the powder  
**[0:39:10-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:10):**  of wheat, could be the mixed meal on top.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:12):**  And basically it's connected to, in this case, your laptop.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:15):**  And that's where the magic is because that's where the calibration software is to actually  
**[0:39:18-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:18):**  understand when it comes out.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:19):**  Because this tracer is something, and you explained it to me before, is something that  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:23):**  you can buy off the market.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:24):**  It's not cheap at all, but it's actually a thing that has been there and has been used  
**[0:39:28-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:28):**  in museums to understand the paint job without actually destroying the painting and getting  
**[0:39:34-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:34):**  the paint.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:35):**  So it's basically a device to understand the quality or the density or the paint mixture,  
**[0:39:40-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:40):**  what has been used, photons.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:41):**  Yeah, it measures photons.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:42):**  It measures the number of photons coming from each element that's in whatever you are measuring.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:48):**  And you don't need to do a whole lot of prep.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:50):**  I mean, you really just puree it.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:52):**  Or we could have done each thing separately.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:54):**  But if we wanted to know the value of the whole meal, so now I have to actually go ahead  
**[0:39:58-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:39:58):**  and create a calibration for pureed meals because-  
**[0:40:02-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:02):**  It makes sense.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:04):**  Because we had to add some water so we know we diluted it.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:07):**  So it was the first time I never pureed a meal.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:11):**  I felt terrible pureing these beautiful meals because they looked gorgeous.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:15):**  And there we were like sticking them in a blender.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:18):**  Roll for science.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:19):**  I was just like, oh my gosh, look at that beautiful meal.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:23):**  And we are pureing.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:24):**  I'm pureing a Dan Barber meal.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:25):**  Yeah, that would be-  
**[0:40:28-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:28):**  Yeah, it almost seemed wrong, but we did it and we could see the differences.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:34):**  And so now what we were thinking was, well, what if we could create these meals and even  
**[0:40:38-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:38):**  meals for people who had unique requirements?  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:41):**  Because we could actually go out there and say, oh, you need more of this or your diet.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:47):**  We already know if you're diabetic, we can do these other things, but then we can add  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:51):**  nutrients that we know will improve, like help you with your diabetes and things like  
**[0:40:55-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:55):**  that.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:40:56):**  So not only do you get this amazingly tasty meal, but it's awesomely good for you.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:00):**  And then we get to the fundamental discussion as food is medicine, which has been thrown  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:06):**  around a million times, but we're finally, it seems like, and correct me if I'm wrong,  
**[0:41:11-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:11):**  getting to a place we can actually start having a serious discussion.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:14):**  I think John Kemp says that in a number of his interviews, like we can actually finally  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:18):**  have, or it seems like we can have a serious discussion for food as medicine, which we  
**[0:41:23-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:23):**  couldn't have until now.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:25):**  I think there are a number of people who have been having it.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:27):**  I mean, I have a quote from a scientist at UCLA, she's in 2003 that says, now that we  
**[0:41:34-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:34):**  have solved our food shortage, now we can really focus on food as medicine.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:41):**  So why did it take so long to get to, let's say more general audience like myself and  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:46):**  like other people on the podcast before we start using that?  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:50):**  I think we as scientists are not really good at communicating what we're doing because  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:54):**  we're really focused.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:41:55):**  I mean, we have tunnel vision and we are really narrowly focused and we were saying, whoa,  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:01):**  I mean, we're just diving into this in a deep drive way.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:05):**  And we're also speaking in terms that generally people don't understand.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:11):**  If somebody has really done a deep dive, you're not going to understand that they're talking  
**[0:42:15-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:15):**  about pathways and for a doxin and doing all these other things.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:18):**  They're like, oh, and you watch people's eyes glaze over.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:24):**  Scientists are really excited about it.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:28):**  But a lot of people aren't.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:29):**  Like I have a graduate student now right now working on iron and zinc and selenium and  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:35):**  how they affect inflammation.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:38):**  And we are actually scanning tissues with the tracer looking at where, if you're really  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:44):**  inflamed, where all the iron is and where all selenium is.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:48):**  And if you're not inflamed, where is it and how is it broken down?  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:51):**  And we're starting, I'm trying to blend, I'm trying to bridge the gap.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:56):**  Literally.  
**[0:42:57-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:57):**  Yeah, literally.  
**[0:42:58-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:58):**  I am.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:42:59):**  I'm trying to bridge the gap where we are, you know, this is really exciting work on  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:03):**  bio iron.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:04):**  And we as farmers can change that.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:08):**  I mean, we can grow things that are really good for people.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:11):**  In a very regenerative way.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:13):**  Like we're not talking here about spraying some weird thing, like adding something to  
**[0:43:17-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:17):**  the system.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:18):**  No, you're actually doing an amazing job for soil, an amazing job for the farmer.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:22):**  And long behold, actually the food, it's a different thing.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:26):**  And it's full of the specific iron you need.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:28):**  Yeah, it's a very different thing.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:31):**  And the thing is, I know we can do it.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:33):**  We're not there quite yet, but we know, and actually I think the only way we can do it  
**[0:43:38-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:38):**  is regeneratively.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:39):**  I'm going to say that I think the only way we can do it is through regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:45):**  What makes you say that?  
**[0:43:46-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:46):**  There's no way to cheat or to play?  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:49):**  Because I asked the same question to Dan Kittrich.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:52):**  I said, like, can't we, like in greenhouses, like really play with all the different elements  
**[0:43:58-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:43:58):**  and variables we have and stuff you can add?  
**[0:44:00-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:00):**  And he said, maybe possibly potentially we could, but it will be so costly that it doesn't  
**[0:44:07-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:07):**  like, it will be so costly to beat mother nature or to beat nature in that way, to beat  
**[0:44:12-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:12):**  healthy soils that it wouldn't make any sense.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:14):**  You might be able to get to that level, but you're actually saying, no, I don't think  
**[0:44:18-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:18):**  we can get to that level of nutrient density without Regenec.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:21):**  I really strongly believe that.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:23):**  I mean, I have worked in hydroponics.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:25):**  I do work in hydroponics and you know, okay, so we've known this for a very long time.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:31):**  Plant physiologists have understood that if roots aren't stressed, and I don't mean like  
**[0:44:37-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:37):**  nutrient stressed or water stressed.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:39):**  I mean, if they actually don't have to push through something, they don't develop properly.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:44):**  So in hydroponics where you're developing in water or some kind of liquid, they don't  
**[0:44:49-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:49):**  have that stress?  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:50):**  They don't have that stress and they don't have to develop in the same way.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:54):**  They don't have to push.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:44:55):**  It means that, okay, they take everything up and it goes straight into the plant and  
**[0:45:00-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:00):**  the plants are weaker.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:01):**  We've always understood that the plants are weaker.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:03):**  I mean, historically we've understood that.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:07):**  Which comes back to the nutrient density and how does this, to the full picture of nutrient  
**[0:45:12-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:12):**  density and not just a few things that we've been measuring so far.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:15):**  No, I mean, it really comes down to whole plant health.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:20):**  And it's much like us.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:21):**  Plants have to be fit.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:24):**  And the fitter they are, the stronger they are, the more they can fend off disease and  
**[0:45:28-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:28):**  insects and the more they talk to each other.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:30):**  And we are exactly the same way.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:32):**  I mean, if you're sitting around swilling nutrients and you're not using your body,  
**[0:45:37-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:37):**  you're not healthy.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:38):**  Plants are exactly the same.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:39):**  They have to exercise themselves.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:41):**  And to switch gears a bit in this interview and get to the finance and investment side,  
**[0:45:47-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:47):**  you mentioned before we've known, we as scientists have known this for a long time.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:51):**  What do you think are the investors listening to this podcast are the biggest things to  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:45:56):**  look out for, things to understand more, things to dive deeper into when it comes to regenerative  
**[0:46:01-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:01):**  agriculture and specifically actually in nutrient density?  
**[0:46:05-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:05):**  What excites you most if you put your entrepreneur hat on and maybe even your investor hat on  
**[0:46:10-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:10):**  over the next years?  
**[0:46:11-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:11):**  Well, and this is always the tricky question for me.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:15):**  From a nutrient density perspective, we are going to develop new methods.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:20):**  We have to develop new methodology and we have to make that methodology accurate.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:25):**  And we have to also have the methodology accessible for farmers.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:30):**  And it's not a hard thing to understand, but it once again, it's about putting the information  
**[0:46:35-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:35):**  in context because quite often context gets blown out of proportion.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:42):**  And I really want, so I would really like investors to be making decisions based on  
**[0:46:48-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:48):**  science.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:49):**  Ask for the numbers, ask for the data.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:51):**  I mean, you make decisions based on numbers like dollar numbers and econ and metrics and  
**[0:46:57-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:57):**  economy metrics and stuff like that.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:46:59):**  But we're not asking for scientific metrics.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:03):**  And I think we need to ask for more of those.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:07):**  And we have to not take no for an answer, like say, okay, well show me your numbers  
**[0:47:12-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:12):**  and show me how you did this.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:14):**  And we also need to understand that a lot of the studies that are going to generate  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:19):**  these things are things that are going to be a little bit more complicated.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:24):**  And we might even, yes.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:27):**  And we have to involve the farmers.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:30):**  And fortunately, some scientists are seeing that now that instead of creating these experiments  
**[0:47:35-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:35):**  yourself, some of these experiments are already on people's farms.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:39):**  Go and use them.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:40):**  Just go and use them.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:42):**  And then as an investor, invest in some of these farmers that are doing those experiments  
**[0:47:47-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:47):**  and the people who are going there and analyzing them, knowing that those numbers are going  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:52):**  to help you invest more wisely and going to help you understand the potential of that  
**[0:47:57-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:47:57):**  system to really generate food that is really nutritionally dense.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:03):**  And it's going to help you develop all these other markets, like food as medicine and develop  
**[0:48:08-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:08):**  cover crop seed and campaigning crop seed markets and genetic markets.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:12):**  I mean, there's all these other markets that just some simple experiments could spin off.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:20):**  And we're not seeing the whole picture, because a lot of times we're focused on the genetics.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:24):**  So we're focused on this, or we're focused on that.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:27):**  And we're not looking at this whole big picture.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:32):**  And we need to see that we're not just spinning off one thing, we're spinning off all these  
**[0:48:36-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:36):**  other things.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:37):**  And we're actually creating momentum for other people to change when we do that.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:42):**  So going back to the whole idea of transition, we're actually creating the transition and  
**[0:48:48-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:48):**  the movement for transition by showing people that these things are possible and that investors  
**[0:48:55-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:48:55):**  really care because they see the value in these other markets.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:01):**  And I think that's just now starting to happen where we're seeing those things.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:10):**  And one other thing that I want to mention there, and I thought about this a lot, is  
**[0:49:16-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:16):**  that I've worked in Africa quite a lot.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:19):**  I've worked in all the poorest countries in Africa, because I believe very strongly in  
**[0:49:27-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:27):**  helping people grow their own food.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:30):**  And it doesn't matter where I am, I really believe strongly in that.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:34):**  And I want them to grow good food.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:36):**  I want them to grow healthy food.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:38):**  But I also want them to integrate everything.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:41):**  And the one thing I would say about investors, and what I really noticed in Africa, and there's  
**[0:49:46-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:46):**  a lot of money invested in Africa, is that investors do not pay attention to culture.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:55):**  And I mean the culture of the people.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:49:58):**  We're focused on growing food for them, but a lot of times we don't realize that we can't  
**[0:50:03-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:03):**  even, they can't even go there unless we're actually embracing their culture first.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:08):**  The things that really matter to them as a group of people.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:12):**  I think that's a point for not just let's say the global south, but any community, any  
**[0:50:19-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:19):**  pharma community.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:20):**  I've seen way too many people easily step into another home or another culture and assume  
**[0:50:27-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:27):**  x y z and tell what to do or what to grow or what to use in terms of tools, etc.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:32):**  And tell them, you know, tell them what to do.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:35):**  And it's the same with the peoples of the First Nations.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:37):**  Exactly.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:38):**  We're not respecting their culture when we come in.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:42):**  And so I've seen, I mean I've seen in Africa, it's like, well why didn't you bring in big  
**[0:50:46-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:46):**  tractors?  
**[0:50:47-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:47):**  I said, well, you know, as a woman, I think about women carrying fuel on their heads for  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:52):**  10 miles and think, I wouldn't want to do that.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:50:56):**  So why would I ask somebody else to do that?  
**[0:51:00-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:00):**  And but I have all these oxen around me.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:03):**  I have all these horses in Lesotho.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:05):**  I have oxen.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:06):**  Well, why wouldn't I use something, a piece of Amish equipment that's really advanced,  
**[0:51:11-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:11):**  but is pulled by animal traction, of which I have lots of.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:17):**  And then why wouldn't I do that?  
**[0:51:18-0:51:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:18):**  Because the culture of men in a lot of these tribal systems, in a lot of these systems,  
**[0:51:25-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:25):**  in a lot of these countries in Africa, men are looked upon as herders and they are responsible  
**[0:51:31-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:31):**  for the livestock and their status in the community.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:35):**  And their self-worth is based on their livestock and the quality of their livestock and how  
**[0:51:39-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:39):**  many animals they have.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:40):**  And if we just focus on growing vegetable matter, then that changes that whole aspect  
**[0:51:45-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:45):**  of their community and their self-worth.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:49):**  And I don't want anybody to feel like they're not worthy.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:54):**  I want them to feel that they are part of this change and that they are an integral  
**[0:51:58-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:51:58):**  part of this change and that everybody needs to work together.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:01):**  And if I'm telling them that they need to throw away this really important part of their  
**[0:52:04-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:04):**  culture and just go here because you just need to feed everybody, it's not going to  
**[0:52:09-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:09):**  happen.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:10):**  And it doesn't happen and it hasn't happened.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:12):**  Yeah, we've seen way too many examples of that going wrong.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:17):**  So that's the one thing that I would say to investors is, you know, be there for the culture,  
**[0:52:25-0:52:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:25):**  respect the culture of the people.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:27):**  It may not be what you think should be right, but they have to take tiny steps.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:32):**  And the one thing I've also learned in developing citizen science programs in that is that everyone,  
**[0:52:39-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:39):**  including the people in developed countries, need to succeed at the first step.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:44):**  So if we are making a transition, every farmer needs to succeed the first step.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:49):**  Because if I don't succeed in the first step, I have no confidence.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:53):**  I don't know that I can go the next step.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:55):**  But if I succeed at the very first step, I will go the next step.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:52:59):**  And if I succeed at that step, I will take the third step.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:01):**  And then by the time I get past the third step, you can walk away from me because I'm  
**[0:53:05-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:05):**  just going to innovate like crazy and I'm good.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:11):**  And too many times, we're not respecting influence theory.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:18):**  And we've learned a lot about how to influence people in influence theory and about how to  
**[0:53:23-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:23):**  cut to the core of, you know, what is inhibiting the behavior and really start working with  
**[0:53:31-0:53:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:31):**  people to do that.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:32):**  And part of that is your culture and your community.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:36):**  Every community is different.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:37):**  Every farm is its own agroecosystem.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:40):**  And oftentimes, we're not respecting that.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:42):**  We want everybody to be the same.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:44):**  And I'll use a French term at this point, vive la difference.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:50):**  We need to celebrate the difference and know that one size fits no one.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:54):**  Which is a very nice bridge to ag, obviously.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:53:57):**  I want to be conscious of our time and finish with two questions, which usually becomes  
**[0:54:03-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:03):**  more.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:04):**  But to start with a very difficult one, because you've been saying you investors and investors  
**[0:54:08-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:08):**  should.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:09):**  If tomorrow morning you wake up and you are in charge of a one billion dollar investment  
**[0:54:15-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:15):**  or one billion euro, depending on Canadian dollar, depending on what you choose, investment  
**[0:54:20-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:20):**  portfolio.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:21):**  And I'm asking this question because I think in the sector, we need to get used to larger  
**[0:54:25-0:54:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:25):**  amounts, not because we have to get more comfortable with that.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:28):**  And we have to start asking ourselves the question, what would we do if people start  
**[0:54:32-0:54:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:32):**  knocking on the door and they want to place larger investments in the space?  
**[0:54:36-0:54:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:36):**  Because I think we're going to see a lot of that happening over the next decade and we  
**[0:54:40-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:40):**  need to be ready.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:41):**  So I'm going to ask you that difficult question.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:43):**  What would you be focusing on?  
**[0:54:44-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:44):**  How would you how would you go to put that to work?  
**[0:54:48-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:48):**  Wow.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:49):**  Well, I would be putting it to work to change.  
**[0:54:54-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:54):**  I'd be I'd be building some demonstrations.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:54:59):**  I'd be looking to certain farms and I'd be, you know.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:05):**  Not helping them, but I'd be looking to really innovative farmers to see if they're first  
**[0:55:10-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:10):**  I'd be asking them and this is I'd be asking them, what can I do to assist you?  
**[0:55:16-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:16):**  Like, is there something that you really need?  
**[0:55:19-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:19):**  You know, if I have this money, is there something that I could do with this money that would  
**[0:55:25-0:55:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:25):**  change your life, change your change the way you do things?  
**[0:55:31-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:31):**  And you know, and honestly, I know already that it might be something simple as well.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:36):**  Yeah, if I could have a mobile seed cleaner, or I could have a mobile average for something  
**[0:55:39-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:39):**  like that, you know, which is which honestly is like, if you had like a few million dollars,  
**[0:55:45-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:45):**  it's not a big investment, but you'd go, really?  
**[0:55:48-0:55:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:48):**  Okay, well, yeah, now what do I do with the rest of the money?  
**[0:55:52-0:55:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:52):**  But I'd be starting there, I'd be starting to ask people, not telling them, but asking  
**[0:55:58-0:56:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:55:58):**  them to really look at what it is that would make their life, which would help them change  
**[0:56:06-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:06):**  or make a transition to something else.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:08):**  Or I'd even ask them the question of what helped you make this change to this next phase  
**[0:56:14-0:56:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:14):**  of you?  
**[0:56:15-0:56:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:15):**  Like, what drove that change?  
**[0:56:17-0:56:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:17):**  Because if you're dealing with an innovator, you say, well, what drove your change to do  
**[0:56:20-0:56:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:20):**  this?  
**[0:56:21-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:21):**  Well, it was this, okay, so how can we make that next change?  
**[0:56:23-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:23):**  And what do you need from me to make that next change?  
**[0:56:26-0:56:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:26):**  And it may be as simple as I need a 10,000 gallon tank to put all my compost extract.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:32):**  And then I need the money to run a field day or to bring people in, you know, and run workshops  
**[0:56:40-0:56:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:40):**  for all the people in my area so that we can all change.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:47):**  And I think that's where some of the time we go.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:51):**  Some of it would be going into like, working with people in the First Nations and we're  
**[0:56:56-0:57:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:56:56):**  bringing people in Africa who are struggling with nutrition and asking them what I just  
**[0:57:03-0:57:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:03):**  asked the other farmers like, no, I don't want you to tell me what the donors think  
**[0:57:09-0:57:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:09):**  you should do.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:10):**  I want to know what you want to do.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:13):**  Because if you want to do this, you will make a change that you will actually embed the  
**[0:57:16-0:57:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:16):**  change in your culture, you'll embed the change, and it will make a difference.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:21):**  And so I'd be using the money to make a difference.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:24):**  And I've used my time.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:26):**  So you know, I look at a sweat equity with my company.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:30):**  And I donate my time, because a lot of times I don't charge.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:35):**  And I donate my time and my expertise to asking people those things and then trying to find  
**[0:57:41-0:57:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:41):**  and match investment funds, and create studies and put people together and build teams that  
**[0:57:48-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:48):**  actually make that difference.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:49):**  And so I'd be doing the same thing.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:51):**  And the last part of what I've been doing with that is looking at bringing in government  
**[0:57:57-0:58:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:57:57):**  officials and people who are influencing government and who are influencing policy change, and  
**[0:58:02-0:58:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:02):**  bringing them to the table as well.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:04):**  But not bringing them to the table.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:08):**  You know, I'm going to put covers on their fancy shoes, and I'm going to put a coat over  
**[0:58:12-0:58:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:12):**  their their suits.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:15):**  And I'm going to make them walk the field with me.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:17):**  And get dirty boots.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:19):**  And get dirty boots, because I want their boots on the ground.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:21):**  I want them to be out with the farmers.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:23):**  I would love them to take the time to spend like two or three days on a farm with the  
**[0:58:29-0:58:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:29):**  farmer in their home, understanding what they're or in a community of farmers and sitting there  
**[0:58:37-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:37):**  every day and talking to them not a town hall style.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:40):**  I don't want politicking.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:41):**  I want them to really hear and experience what these people are doing.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:45):**  Sit in a combine.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:46):**  Sit in a combine in the Pacific Northwest and have the ride of your life in a self leveling  
**[0:58:51-0:58:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:51):**  combine.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:52):**  It scares the wits out of you.  
**[0:58:54-0:58:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:54):**  And these farmers are doing it every day.  
**[0:58:56-0:59:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:58:56):**  They just, you know, riding the side hills, coming straight down things that, you know,  
**[0:59:01-0:59:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:01):**  defy gravity and understanding what they're what they're doing.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:05):**  And also understanding how important it is what they're doing when they start doing these  
**[0:59:10-0:59:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:10):**  regenerative practices.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:13):**  Stand out of their way.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:16):**  Don't try and legislate them all to pieces.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:18):**  Like stand out of the way and let them innovate and support the innovation.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:23):**  You know, so if I think in the states like the risk management agency, well, I need 20  
**[0:59:27-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:27):**  years of data before we can change that practice and we can ensure this.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:30):**  Well, how does a new farmer, if they're buying a farm from the bank, they have to have insurance.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:36):**  So how do they use this?  
**[0:59:37-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:37):**  I'd be using money to change that, too.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:39):**  I mean, I'd be using money to get after that.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:43):**  And even if it meant starting my own insurance company to actually insure these young farmers  
**[0:59:48-0:59:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:48):**  so they could actually do those practices or creating a bank that actually paid attention  
**[0:59:54-1:00:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=0:59:54):**  to that and actually loaned, gave preferential loans based on soil health and based on the  
**[1:00:02-1:00:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:02):**  fact that I'm building all these ecosystem services in and, you know, give me a preferential  
**[1:00:08-1:00:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:08):**  loan based on that basis.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:10):**  You know, help me out.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:11):**  That would be truly revolutionary.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:13):**  And now for the final question, if you could change, so you're unfortunately no longer  
**[1:00:18-1:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:18):**  in charge of the one billion dollar investment fund, but you have the power to change one  
**[1:00:23-1:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:23):**  thing in the food and agriculture system.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:26):**  And overnight with your magic wand, you, Jill, can change one thing.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:29):**  What would that be?  
**[1:00:32-1:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:32):**  If I could change one thing, I think I would do the last thing.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:36):**  I would actually create a bank, much like the microloan system.  
**[1:00:42-1:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:42):**  I would create a bank that allowed farmers that were doing regenerative practices to  
**[1:00:47-1:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:47):**  be free to innovate, be free to try things, be free to do what they thought was, you know,  
**[1:00:57-1:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:57):**  to brainstorm and do their wildest idea.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:00:59):**  I would support that.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:01):**  I would still want to see some data on it and I would support them to keep records on  
**[1:01:05-1:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:05):**  it.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:06):**  But I would be supporting that kind of innovation.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:10):**  And some of it would be really simple.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:11):**  Like, well, I just want to try this mixed cover crop.  
**[1:01:16-1:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:16):**  And I would also support a system of people that were there, just like the chat.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:21):**  You know, when you are on a new software system and you can hit the button to chat with somebody,  
**[1:01:26-1:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:26):**  it's like, well, I want to talk over, you know, I'm going to try this new system.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:30):**  You know, what is the background that I would need to, you know, understand?  
**[1:01:34-1:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:34):**  Like, should I have these species together or what would this be?  
**[1:01:37-1:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:37):**  Is have something there that would support them so they just like go, okay, well, now  
**[1:01:41-1:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:41):**  I'm going to go and do that.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:44):**  And because I think more farmers would, and everywhere around the world, gardeners, anybody,  
**[1:01:52-1:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:52):**  would do some more things if they, you know, felt like they could be successful and that  
**[1:01:56-1:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:01:56):**  there was somebody that really cared behind them, like standing there to just support  
**[1:02:02-1:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:02):**  their change or for them to be able to talk about their change or their crazy wild idea  
**[1:02:06-1:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:06):**  that was like totally off the wall like I did and just say, okay, well, you know, I  
**[1:02:12-1:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:12):**  think you should go for it.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:13):**  Let's go and try.  
**[1:02:14-1:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:14):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:15):**  Just, just the Aussies have a great saying, give it a go, mate.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:19):**  Just be able to give it a go.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:22):**  And they need some regenerative agriculture.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:24):**  And they need regenerative agriculture, just like the rest of us.  
**[1:02:27-1:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:27):**  With that, Joe, I want to thank you so much for your time.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:30):**  I don't think it's the last time we'll be talking on the podcast.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:34):**  I wish you a lot of luck with all the work you've been doing.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:37):**  And it's going to be a very interesting year.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:38):**  Thank you so much.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:39):**  It is.  
**[1:02:40-1:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:40):**  And good luck to you too.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:41):**  I mean, I hope more people support your podcast.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:44):**  I really do.  
**[1:02:45-1:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:45):**  It's well worth supporting.  
**[1:02:46-1:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:46):**  You're doing a great job.  
**[1:02:48-1:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:02:48):**  Thank you so much.

**[1:06:10-1:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:06:10):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:06:12-1:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/27/jill-clapperton/#t=1:06:12):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

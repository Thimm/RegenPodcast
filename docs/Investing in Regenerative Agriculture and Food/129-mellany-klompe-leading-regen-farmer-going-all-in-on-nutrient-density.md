### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 17:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:04-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:04):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course, or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:13):**  One of the leading region farmers in Europe is building an experience center in the Netherlands  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:18):**  to show the connection between healthy soils, healthy produce, and healthy people, and empower  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:22):**  farmers to seek independent advice on a regenerative transition, not advice paid for by the chemical  
**[0:00:28-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:28):**  input industry.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:29):**  So farmers can finally negotiate a better price with the retail industry based on quality,  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:34):**  not on quantity.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:38):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:42):**  planet mattered podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:47):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:51-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:51):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:58):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:00):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:04):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:06):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:11):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:15):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:19):**  our work.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:20):**  And so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:22):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:27):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:40):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:42):**  Welcome to another episode today with farmer Melanie Klompa together with her husband Jeroen,  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:46):**  who we had on one of the earlier podcasts.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:49):**  She runs probably one of the most innovative farms in Western Europe.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:51):**  She's also co founder of soil heroes and director of the soil heroes foundation.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:55):**  Welcome Melanie.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:56):**  Hello, Koon.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:57):**  Good morning.  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:58):**  Good morning.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:59):**  I'm so happy to have you on the show.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:01):**  And I'm starting with a personal question, which I know in this case is a very interesting,  
**[0:02:05-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:05):**  very interesting journey that you had leading you to working very deeply on soil and on  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:11):**  farming.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:12):**  But what has been that journey to farming?  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:13):**  Yeah, I think it started with my study.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:16):**  I studied environmental science at the time when I needed to choose which direction I  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:23):**  wanted to study it was or I wanted to make people healthier.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:27):**  So become a doctor or something else.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:31):**  Or yeah, try to achieve a better world and make the world healthier.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:36):**  So I choose the letter.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:38):**  And after I finished that education, I worked on several governmental organizations, primarily  
**[0:02:46-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:46):**  on landscape biodiversity, and as we are and water here in the Netherlands, we have a specific  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:54):**  organization.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:56):**  It's called the water boards here.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:59):**  And it's a very big governmental organization.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:02):**  So you could say from that perspective, I always were involved with water, with soils  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:09):**  and biodiversity.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:12):**  And as we are living in the Netherlands, if you look at the rural countryside, it's always  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:17):**  about agriculture combined with all these elements.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:22):**  So yeah, the old things together, agriculture, soils, biodiversity, water.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:28):**  Yeah, I created and developed my own interest.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:31):**  And then because we have a farm at home, I'm also in the time between married farmer.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:39):**  I'm not a native farmer myself, but my husband is.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:44):**  And if you talk to each other on the kitchen table, yeah, you could say the two worlds  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:48):**  big yeah, emerged together.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:52):**  And I discovered that the soil problems were huge for the farm.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:57):**  And then together with my husband, yeah, we started to, you could say, on this journey  
**[0:04:03-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:03):**  to see how we could make the soil healthier and better as we had discovered about 10 years  
**[0:04:11-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:11):**  ago, especially we suffered from a big, you could say, soil compaction, soil depletion,  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:19):**  or our organic matter was going down rapidly.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:23):**  So yeah, from that point on, together with my husband, step by step, plot by plot, we  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:29):**  added measures to create a systemic change in it.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:34):**  And it meant for us that we need to do farming on a very different way than the conventional  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:40):**  way we were used to.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:42):**  And we also discovered that, for instance, advisors, the current advices, which we had  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:48):**  done around the farm could not help us with the systemic change.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:53):**  So we needed to develop our own knowledge on that.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:57):**  And at that time when we started, the word regenerative farming was not known at all  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:02):**  here in the Netherlands.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:04):**  And I think about seven years ago, that was the first time we discovered that there was  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:09):**  a technique like regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:13):**  And from that point on, yeah, I'm always telling the world, from that point on, you have a  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:18):**  word you can Google, and then the world opens up.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:22):**  And then everything becomes easier.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:24):**  You're not alone anymore.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:25):**  No, but we saw we were pretty alone in Northwest Europe.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:32):**  But we saw that farmers in, especially Australia and the center of America and South Africa  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:40):**  already were exploring and doing a reach and act practices.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:45):**  And yeah, we read a lot about them.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:48):**  We got in contact with them and tried to step by step apply those measures also on our farm.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:55):**  So that's how we began with our journey.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:58):**  And do you remember what was the first step from the kitchen table discussions in the  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:02):**  evenings during dinner, breakfast, etc, where you sort of started working together on that?  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:08):**  Like what was the first things you did in the field?  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:11):**  Like how did it get from the kitchen table to the field for the first time, which could  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:14):**  be something very big, something very small?  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:16):**  Like what was the first pilot or the first trial or the first steps you did when you  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:21):**  realized, okay, our soil is going down.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:23):**  We don't want to leave farming and just give up.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:26):**  I'm saying just between brackets because it's obviously not easy, but we want to do something  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:30):**  about it.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:31):**  What was the first step there?  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:32):**  Yeah, I think the first step, we are always looking at the practices with the lowest costs  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:38):**  and the biggest benefits.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:39):**  And if you're talking about that, it's about for us here in the Netherlands, it was about  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:45):**  aiming for 365 days of covered soils.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:50):**  Just to give a bit of background, how big is the farm?  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:52):**  I mean, I will link to it obviously in the show notes, but just to give a bit of background.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:56):**  Yeah, we have an arable farm just 20 kilometers below Rotterdam.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:01):**  It's one of the real specific regions in the Netherlands for arable farming.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:07):**  So there are a few, mostly in the Netherlands.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:10):**  We have dairy farms.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:12):**  There are more on the Netherlands and on the peat areas, but on the sea clay areas, there  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:17):**  are some specific spots in the Netherlands and those are very useful and you could say  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:23):**  highly productive for arable farming.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:26):**  And those are also the, you could say the areas where the potatoes are growing in the  
**[0:07:32-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:32):**  Netherlands.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:33):**  You could say potatoes is our biggest export product together with the onions and the shallots.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:40):**  And then in, you could say the areas with the lower quality.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:44):**  Yeah, they usually grow or the cereals on it or it's in the Netherlands and peat land.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:52):**  So we are under one of those real specific arable plots.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:56):**  We have a farm of 360 hectares for the Netherlands that is pretty big because the average in  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:02):**  the Netherlands is about 100 hectares.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:04):**  So we are more than three times bigger than that.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:09):**  And yeah, that's also, you could say a bigger challenge to make the transition towards rich  
**[0:08:15-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:15):**  and egg possible because what we saw in examples is that a farms of a few hectares or just  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:23):**  10 or 20 hectares, it's much more easier to do the transition to what's rich and egg compared  
**[0:08:30-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:30):**  with these, you could say highly industrial farming areas, which we are in margins, which  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:38):**  we have here on the island.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:41):**  So for us, what I would just tell you highly industrial, very efficient, heavily financially  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:49):**  based crop rotation plan.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:52):**  So the first steps were mainly about, okay, cover the soil 365 days.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:57):**  So we started with cover crops.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:00):**  It's beginning, it was just grass, but then soon later we saw that it was better to use  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:06):**  a bigger variety of a cover crop.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:09):**  So we looked at root structure.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:12):**  So it's about more deep root name, a cover crops.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:15):**  Also looking at added values of cover crops, like a nitrogen fixing, but also, yeah, you  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:23):**  could say the more various your root system is, the better your soil structure can improve.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:30):**  So that was the first thing we started with.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:33):**  And then also one of the other measures we cut out is that we, and that was more about  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:39):**  my knowledge from the waterboard is that I saw that the level of antibiotics in slurry  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:46):**  manure became very high.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:49):**  So we measured that for instance, in the water levels through the waterboard.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:53):**  So basically what, instead of using artificial fertilizer, a lot of farmers are using slurry,  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:59):**  especially because we have a large dairy industry.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:01):**  No, no, no, in a conventional farming here in the Netherlands, they use artificial fertilizers  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:09):**  combined with slurry.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:11):**  Coming from the dairy industry.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:12):**  Yeah, dairy or pigs industry.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:16):**  And you were seeing that antibiotics coming, which they were feeding or they were giving  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:20):**  to these animals.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:21):**  You were seeing that in the water.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:22):**  So it meant it went through the animals onto your land, into the water.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:27):**  And so through the manure, we saw that the, you could say our salts were being toscated  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:32):**  by antibiotics and the water around it.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:36):**  And, and with runoff and it came in the surface water and the waterboard was measuring that.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:41):**  And because we are such a specific arable region, the only way it, antibiotics, which  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:48):**  have a reference to dairy must come from the manure.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:53):**  So I told my husband, yeah, and sorry, life is very important.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:57):**  So let's cut out the slurry of manure and turn it to compost and only solid manure.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:04):**  How difficult was that?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:05):**  Very difficult because it's not difficult to cut out the slurry manure, but to find  
**[0:11:11-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:11):**  solid manure, that's a very big challenge because most farmers only have slurry manure,  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:19):**  solid manures only from farms, which you could say a very authentic way of farming.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:26):**  So they have the cows and the pig still on straw and not on a, on a surface where the  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:32):**  concrete, where the slurry goes through.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:36):**  Because that's where they mix the manure with the liquid and then you get a slurry.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:40):**  And then you have the separations.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:43):**  So that's, what's the first challenge.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:45):**  And then we combined it with compost, but not any quality of compost.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:49):**  You have big varieties of quality of compost.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:52):**  We had it on the show before.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:55):**  It's it could be anything.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:57):**  We were very critical about that.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:59):**  And did you see the antibiotics going down because with a solid manure, is there less  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:03):**  antibiotics in it or it's less prone to runoff?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:06):**  Did you see that as an effect also on the land and the water around?  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:09):**  Yeah, that's because there are so much farms around us.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:13):**  We can't measure the difference, but it is only about my knowledge that I know that in  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:17):**  slurry manure, the antibiotics level is much higher than solid manure.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:23):**  So that's why for our soils, we want to detoxify it.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:28):**  And those were the two steps to start with.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:31):**  And now like when you're looking, because you have many fields that are in almost all  
**[0:12:36-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:36):**  the fields are in transition somewhere.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:38):**  And when we look, this was quite a few years ago when you started with this.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:41):**  Now, when you look at the most advanced fields, the fields that are by far the most, let's  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:46):**  say onwards in this journey, what are you doing there different than let's say a neighbor  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:50):**  that's on a field next door?  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:51):**  How can we as non-farmers, if we're listening, if we would stand there and we would stand  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:55):**  there maybe for a year, what would we see as difference compared to the neighbor that's  
**[0:13:00-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:00):**  doing things convention?  
**[0:13:01-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:02):**  From the foundation, we created guidebook for 20 principles.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:07):**  And from those 20 principles now on the most advanced plots, we apply 16 of them.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:14):**  So that's, you could say, what makes this difference than the neighbor is that, yeah,  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:19):**  maybe those 16 practices we are doing.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:23):**  And those four, now I'm curious, obviously, because I think we can, I will link obviously  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:27):**  to the guidebook.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:28):**  What are the things you are not doing yet and why?  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:31):**  The thing we are not doing yet is integration.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:33):**  And that's also the regional problem to combine it with cows or have a collaboration with  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:40):**  a dairy farm where you can, you could say rent cows or pigs or, or sheeps.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:46):**  They are more than 60 kilometers away.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:48):**  So that gives a very big challenge.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:50):**  So we are not doing that yet.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:52):**  We try to substitute that with applying bio fertilizer and make our own bio fertilizer.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:58):**  And one, you can make various recipes of bio fertilize.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:04):**  And one of them is you can make one from solid manure.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:09):**  So you can have the advantage of all the fungi and biological activities and multiply it  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:15):**  via bio fertilize and then spray it on the fields.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:20):**  So that is how we try to substitute them.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:23):**  Also one of them is use your own, you could say growing material.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:28):**  So if you harvest potatoes, keep your potato separate and then use the baby potatoes to  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:35):**  seed the year after that again, because if you are able to do that, you will build up  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:41):**  a natural resilience in your primarily product.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:45):**  You could say the seeds you are using.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:48):**  We are not allowed to do that in the Netherlands because all seed material must be certified.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:56):**  And yeah, we don't have that capacity and that facilitation here on the farm.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:03):**  So we can get all our seed material certified.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:07):**  And if we are not producing food from certified seed, we are not allowed to sell our products  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:15):**  to the retail.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:16):**  So that's more like keeping it closed.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:20):**  So that's one else.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:22):**  And then yeah, you could say practices like the ultimate way is agroforestry that you  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:29):**  also integrate trees on your plots in lanes and bushes.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:34):**  We are not there yet.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:36):**  This is the first year we experienced, we did some experience with lane farming.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:42):**  When you could say loin farming is a first step towards agroforestry.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:47):**  So integrate more trees.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:50):**  And what is lane farming just for people that the different lanes next to each other are  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:53):**  different crops or is that very simple?  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:56):**  Yes.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:57):**  So it's not one field of x meters by x meters?  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:00):**  No, you're not doing monocultures on a plot.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:04):**  So for instance, we started with, you could say our most advanced region ag plot with  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:10):**  this.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:11):**  It's a plot of 20 hectares.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:13):**  And on that 20 hectares, we grow five different crops and lanes like six meters broad.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:21):**  Also we integrated some biodiversity lanes in them, also to increase the natural resilience  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:27):**  of that plot.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:29):**  And by doing that, you could say you make your plants more resilient because you don't  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:35):**  have a monoculture.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:37):**  So diseases and plagues don't have that much to hold on when it's only a strip of six meters  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:45):**  and another crop is alongside it.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:48):**  And if you choose it right, it can empower the other crops.  
**[0:16:53-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:53):**  So it's also about looking at which a crop can be a companion in natural resilience to  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:00):**  other crops.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:01):**  And how did that go the first year?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:03):**  I mean, it's early still, but how did, what's your first, I mean, it's tricky for sure,  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:07):**  because like planning wise, you need to be really, and movements of machines, et cetera,  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:12):**  need to be orchestrated in an absolutely perfect way.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:16):**  Yeah, but that's also, we are working with GPS and controlled traffic farming, so we  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:22):**  are already there.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:23):**  So that's also one of the practices we apply in the farm.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:27):**  But what we see now, if for instance, in the lane farming, we also grow our own soybeans  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:33):**  because we also produce soy sauce.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:35):**  Yeah, we had Bert on the show.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:37):**  I will link it below as well.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:38):**  Yeah, from Thomasu.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:40):**  And what we see now is that we did not spray anything on the soy field.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:44):**  We had some problems with snails and then we made a bio fertilizer based on garlic and  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:53):**  we spray that on it.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:54):**  And then the problem was solved.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:57):**  And that was mainly the only problem we had.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:59):**  And the plants are looking so healthy and big.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:02):**  We did not see them that big because we also have a plot, a mono plot, a monoculture plot  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:08):**  with soybeans.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:09):**  So you can easily compare, even though it's not the same plot and it's not in the same  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:13):**  journey, but you can.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:14):**  Yeah, but the plants in the lane farm looks much bigger.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:18):**  The leaves looks bigger.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:20):**  The plants are bigger.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:21):**  So you see that the plant is much healthier than it is compared with the plot with the  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:27):**  monoculture on it.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:29):**  Wow.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:30):**  And that's in one year.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:31):**  So you start tweaking the recipe further and find even better companions or, and then how  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:36):**  to, I mean, the rotation becomes a bigger puzzle, but yeah.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:40):**  And in the winter, we also on the same lanes, we sowing different types of cover crops.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:46):**  For instance, for the soy, we wanted to sow in nitrogen fixing cover crops.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:51):**  So we will capture nitrogen on a natural way into the soil.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:55):**  And when you grow next year, the soil on that, the soil can benefit from the nitrogen, which  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:01):**  is yeah, you could say fixed in the soil for them.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:05):**  So on that way, you can cut out a artificial fertilizer also.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:10):**  And there are a lot of, if you have wheat problems, for instance, you can use other  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:16):**  cover crops to suppress those wheat problems.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:20):**  And so yeah, I have the benefit of that the year after when you are sowing your cash for.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:26):**  And with all these experiments and all this work you're doing and transitioning all these  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:31):**  plots, what was the reason to set up a foundation next to the farm and next to the work at Soy  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:37):**  Heroes and of course, next to work at Tommaso, what was the reason to set up a non for profit  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:42):**  on the farm, but next to the farm as a company farm?  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:45):**  Yeah, well, mainly because we experienced, as I told you that in Northwest Europe, rich  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:51):**  and ag farming is not known at all.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:54):**  And if we're looking at the system here, especially in the Netherlands, but also in Belgium, mainly,  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:00):**  it's all the advisors have the connection with the supply chain or the artificial fertilizers  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:06):**  or the plant protection product.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:08):**  So the agronomists, the ones that need to help and work alongside the farmers at the  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:12):**  end of the day are paid through the industry, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:16):**  you know what they're selling.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:17):**  That's their...  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:19):**  And it is in their benefit.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:22):**  You don't try other things and divide from their track.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:25):**  Or other companies or make your own bio fertilizer like you're doing.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:29):**  So they don't like that.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:31):**  Maybe that's a little bit bad to say, but they sell fear and they sell risk.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:38):**  So if you're telling a farmer, you're taking a risk, not by spraying, you should be afraid  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:44):**  because your neighbor has played this.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:47):**  Maybe you also need to spray.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:48):**  So the plague don't come to your crop.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:52):**  That's their job.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:53):**  So they're telling you all things about risk management, about safety to protect your crops  
**[0:20:59-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:59):**  against plagues and diseases without it's really in your field, but just in case of,  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:07):**  we saw, okay, we need an independent place where people can come for knowledge about  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:13):**  region egg.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:14):**  So that's why we started the foundation.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:17):**  So it's primarily, you could say to empower farmers in knowledge, in education about a  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:23):**  region egg practices.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:25):**  So we try to provide it via the documents we are producing.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:30):**  For instance, the 20 principles we have now on our website, also on the experience farm,  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:36):**  we receive a lot of, welcome a lot of farmers and organizations who wants to look at how  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:42):**  we are doing because farmers really like to hear from other farmers, how they are doing  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:47):**  it because it's really farm management related.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:51):**  And so that's one thing.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:53):**  And also we do a lot of projects on the farm to really make region egg practices and the  
**[0:21:59-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:59):**  improvement of soil, feasible and measurable because the more you can show them and more  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:07):**  it's measurable.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:09):**  The higher you could say the reliability is for them that it's working and they should  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:14):**  try it also.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:15):**  And so I think the measurement piece is absolutely essential as we often hear anecdotally stories  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:22):**  of farmers that are in some kind of transition, but then if you don't have the data underneath,  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:27):**  it's really difficult to persuade or encourage others to start as well.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:31):**  So what on the measurement part, what are you focusing on to show and to make public  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:36):**  in this, this massive transition that the farm is on?  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:39):**  What has been the measurement pieces you're working on?  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:41):**  Yeah, you could say in Soul Heroes, we started with the focus on four teams.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:46):**  So it's about carbon sequestration.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:49):**  It's about water holding capacity, biodiversity and nutrition.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:54):**  And on the first three elements like the carbon sequestration, water holding capacity and  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:59):**  by the first three we have now already projects running on the farm.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:04):**  We collaborate with, yeah, you could say, scientific partners on that with the University  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:10):**  of Wageningen and the University of Amsterdam on that.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:15):**  What has been the biggest surprise?  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:17):**  Because we often hear now in the scientific community or we often that they are actually  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:22):**  that some of the leading farmers in the Regen Ag movement are almost ahead of what's happening  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:26):**  in the university plots or university farms.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:28):**  So what has been your biggest surprise working with these?  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:31):**  What have you seen coming out that you may be expecting that they didn't or the other  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:35):**  way around?  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:36):**  Well, my first experience is that they were surprised that they were, you could say, approached  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:41):**  by farmers to do this research instead of the other way around.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:48):**  Basically university comes to farmers that they want to do some investigation.  
**[0:23:53-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:53):**  I think that also meant that we wanted especially to have scientific based research on a very  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:00):**  practical base.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:02):**  So it's about the lowest barriers for farmers.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:06):**  It's about gathering data which farmers understand, but a lot of farmers already are able to gather  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:13):**  those data in a very easy way.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:16):**  A lot of farmers, for instance, here in the Netherlands already have a lot of sensors.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:20):**  They can do very easy soil analysis at their farm.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:26):**  And with those data, then we can provide them with, that's what we're working on, on a real  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:33):**  outcome to measure water holding capacity and carbon sequestration.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:39):**  And for biodiversity, it's mainly about, yeah, real counting biodiversity activity on your  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:46):**  farm.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:47):**  So it's counting all the insects.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:48):**  It's also counting macrofauna in the canals alongside the plots and see what the differences  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:55):**  are.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:56):**  See how far the biodiversity power is divided from those, for instance, biodiversity lanes.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:02):**  Yeah, you published something on that recently, right?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:04):**  There's some research coming out on that.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:07):**  It's about designing your plots.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:10):**  Especially with this lane farming as well to really, so you're just in, just out of  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:14):**  clarity, a biodiversity lane is a lane that you have either around the farm or also integrated  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:19):**  into plots that is not being harvested, but it's primarily being seeded with a mix of  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:25):**  different plants and flowers, et cetera, to help biodiversity, a lot of insects mainly.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:29):**  And this research was to look at what's the effect, like how far do these insects actually  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:33):**  travel and help the plants?  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:35):**  And when do you need to plan your next biodiversity lane to have the full effect on the plots  
**[0:25:38-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:38):**  that are next door?  
**[0:25:40-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:41):**  And the research of Wageningen University, of the Amsterdam University, who's helping  
**[0:25:46-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:46):**  us is mainly in potatoes because the potato is the economic, the most important crop for  
**[0:25:53-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:53):**  us and what they choose to look at the aphids population in potatoes and see how much aphids  
**[0:26:01-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:01):**  looser.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:02):**  It's an insect.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:04):**  Okay.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:05):**  So it's one that you don't want, right?  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:07):**  That's just the way.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:10):**  And how much from such a biodiversity element, the aphids populations is suppressed by a  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:17):**  natural pest control.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:19):**  And how far was that?  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:20):**  Like how far did these insects fly and ate these aphids from the plant or somehow suppress  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:25):**  them?  
**[0:26:26-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:26):**  We are now in the third year.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:27):**  And what we see now is that it's about 100, 150 meters.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:33):**  Which is far.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:35):**  And if you have, for instance, on the side, the only field margins, you're by the diversity  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:41):**  lane, you need to have such a lane every 300 meters.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:46):**  And then you could say your crops is covered a bit for the natural pest control.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:52):**  So those are the first outcomes we are now having.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:56):**  And pollination, it even goes further.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:58):**  But we see that plots or plants who don't have access to natural pollination, we do  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:05):**  that research in our soya bean fields.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:08):**  And we see that those plants are producing 30 to 40% less in weight of beans compared  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:17):**  with the plants who have access to a natural pollination.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:21):**  So it really means something.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:24):**  Which means that you can make that calculation of, okay, I'm losing, losing between brackets.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:28):**  A few meters of a biodiversity lane, but I'm getting 30 or somewhere like a lot more in  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:34):**  terms of soya bean weight, which is a very important measure.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:37):**  And then you can make the calculation, which probably falls in favor of hiring insects  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:41):**  for the job.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:43):**  So it's more about what we add to the research of the universities that needs to be practical,  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:49):**  doable by the farmer himself.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:52):**  Clots that cost intensive because a lot of research done by university and when the farmers  
**[0:27:59-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:59):**  want to apply them, they're really cost intensive.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:02):**  And it also must be doable for them.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:05):**  They must understand what they are doing.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:07):**  And also because when they understand what they are doing, when they understand the outcome  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:12):**  of the data, they really see the improvement.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:15):**  And then they also get encouraged to go further with more measures or do it on more plots.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:21):**  And the same is with, for instance, the research on biodiversity.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:24):**  If you combine it with the elements economics, and you will have a very powerful instrument  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:30):**  because it's not about on ecology, it's also about economy.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:35):**  And those were the elements we are looking for here at the farm.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:40):**  And the third team we want to start this autumn is a big nutrition project.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:46):**  Mainly it's about if your soils are healthier or become healthier, you will see that the  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:53):**  dynamics in soil are increasing between also the plants and the products and soil.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:59):**  So there are a lot of literature available already where everybody is telling about if  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:06):**  you get healthy soil, you get a healthy plant, you get a healthy product.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:11):**  Okay, how can we make that measurable and visible?  
**[0:29:15-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:15):**  In your circumstances, in your context?  
**[0:29:17-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:18):**  And together with Dr. Jill Kleppertrom from the USA, she has developed a great system  
**[0:29:24-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:24):**  for that.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:26):**  And it's all based on measuring nutrients in the soil, measuring the same nutrients  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:31):**  done in the plant and in the products.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:34):**  And if the soil is healthy, the transition must be there.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:38):**  And you must see the correlation between the nutrients in the soil, in the plant and in  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:44):**  the products.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:45):**  So what we want to do with research is not only provide with evidence that the better  
**[0:29:51-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:51):**  the balance is reached in soil, the better the correlation is between those three elements,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:59):**  but also we want to show that the density of those nutrients and the difference between  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:05):**  the nutrients, so more nutrients in the products is achieved.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:10):**  And if we can do that, I think we have very powerful research for farmers to have a communication  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:18):**  with the retail because they then really can say, I've grown my potatoes on a regen egg  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:25):**  whey.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:26):**  My potatoes have a higher nutrition level than just a conventional grown potato.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:32):**  I've got a research paper here from Sol Harris Foundation who says that.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:38):**  And I want you to pay me more because I did a bigger and a greater job.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:43):**  So that's what we want to achieve with the last project.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:47):**  Super interesting.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:48):**  And very concretely, you're looking for funding for that.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:51):**  So anybody interested in showing this relationship between healthy soil, healthy plant, healthy  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:57):**  produce, and then we go, as I know, Joe Klepperta and I will put the interview below as well.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:01):**  We had her on the show.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:02):**  Thanks to you guys, by the way.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:04):**  She's also working with Dan Barber who also should be out soon or is already out for this  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:08):**  interview when you're listening to this, but showing that relationship then with healthy  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:11):**  people, healthy gut system and healthy people and then healthy ecosystem.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:15):**  That line is very, very strong and needs to be shown everywhere.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:18):**  It cannot be shown just in grain somewhere.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:20):**  It needs to be shown also in potatoes and also in soybeans and also in onions because  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:25):**  we need, as you're selling your huge farm, you're selling mostly to retail.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:28):**  You're not selling directly on a farmer's market, which is impossible.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:31):**  We need to have an argument to the retail saying, okay, this is not the same potato  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:35):**  as the other potato.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:36):**  This is a fundamentally different thing.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:38):**  And thus we need to have a discussion about price and because it has a different benefit  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:42):**  to your end consumer.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:43):**  And so that's, it's absolutely essential research that we have to do.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:47):**  It's nice you mentioned Dan Barber because Jill is also very connected with Dan.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:51):**  She wants to do this research also on the farm from Dan Barber.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:55):**  Then she wants to do the research on our farm, on our experience farm, you could say.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:00):**  And then probably also in a farm in Finland.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:04):**  So you've got like a more colder continent.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:07):**  You've got the, you could say the Northwest Europe continent, sea clay, and then she wants  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:14):**  to do it on a continental climate based farm and from Dan Barber.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:20):**  So by combining those three research projects, you could say, it's also building up a higher  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:27):**  reliability if it's done on three different farms and three different types of soils,  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:33):**  because then you really can show that the relation and the correlation is there.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:38):**  You've mentioned the experience farm a few times.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:40):**  What's your vision there?  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:41):**  What's already there?  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:42):**  I mean, people can experience the farm literally, but there's a bigger vision to be built.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:46):**  I mean, people can, I've done that other people I know, you, you go on a tour, you see many  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:50):**  different different, interesting things, but your vision on the experience farm, I think  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:54):**  is bigger than what it is now and just to visit the farm.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:58):**  So what's your vision on making sure that people can really experience this and mainly  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:02):**  farmers and other people from the food sector, obviously like retail needs to experience  
**[0:33:06-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:06):**  this as well, but let's start with farmers.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:08):**  What should they experience in your vision of an experience farm?  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:11):**  The experience farm is our own farm and that has his limits because we also have a very  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:17):**  highly economic pressure on the farm.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:20):**  You could say it's a family farm.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:22):**  So our highest ambition is to have an independence experience center with his own fields around  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:29):**  it where we can experiment on a much higher level than we do now, because now we always  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:35):**  need to be aware of the current farm management itself.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:40):**  We also need to rely on our own employees for that.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:44):**  But from my perspective, we really need an independent place.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:49):**  Which is not selling anything.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:51):**  And also, just to be honest, it's now in my house.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:56):**  It's in our home.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:57):**  Which is nice until it's not nice anymore.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:00):**  No, no.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:03):**  So an independent place where we can 100% focus on this with experience fields around  
**[0:34:10-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:10):**  it, giving students a full time 365 days, providing them an experience field research  
**[0:34:19-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:19):**  area.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:20):**  How big are you imagining?  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:22):**  How many hectares do you think is ideal in your context to show stuff?  
**[0:34:25-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:25):**  Is it 20?  
**[0:34:26-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:26):**  Is it 50?  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:27):**  Yeah, because we really want to be an example for the large-scale farms.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:32):**  As I told you, that is the biggest problem.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:35):**  And I think if you are aiming for the big change, then you need to aim for the industrial  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:41):**  way of farming.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:42):**  So we need to aim for bigger farms.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:44):**  Because it's the biggest amount of hectares and the biggest amount of antibiotics and  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:47):**  the biggest amount of spraying.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:49):**  I would say a farm of 100 hectares then must be the example, the ideal example.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:58):**  So having such an experience farm started here in Northwest Europe because I think we  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:03):**  have a lot of farmers to convince here.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:06):**  Also it's the area where a lot of industrial farming has been done.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:11):**  But then also, if you look at a wider global perspective, I also think that per climate  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:18):**  zone or per types of farm, I also think that for instance, for dairy, there's a totally  
**[0:35:24-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:24):**  different scope of measure, scope of focus for transition towards rich and ag.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:32):**  So it's not only, we want to start with our own arable experience farm, but I think we  
**[0:35:38-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:38):**  also in the end need to look at different global zones and also different types of farming.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:46):**  And do you see any business model there?  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:48):**  I'm asking because I always love to ask the question, what would you do with a billion  
**[0:35:51-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:51):**  dollars?  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:52):**  And it sounds like you would focus on experience farms, but do you see any way a business model  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:56):**  or it would really be experienced farms need to be, I mean, they need to be independent  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:00):**  for sure, but they also need to be a non-for-profit or they shouldn't have to focus.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:04):**  Like what do you see there?  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:05):**  Is there any way, because it's maybe a lot easier to start many of these if there is  
**[0:36:10-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:10):**  some kind of small, even very small business model and you don't need to raise only grant  
**[0:36:13-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:13):**  funding for it.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:14):**  Or will it be blended?  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:15):**  What do you think?  
**[0:36:16-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:16):**  No, I think the aim is that it's a farm which provides profit because otherwise we don't  
**[0:36:23-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:23):**  empower farmers.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:24):**  From the farming properly, from the farming system as a whole.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:27):**  And that's also why I think the experience farm needs to be about 100 hectares because  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:33):**  of a crop rotation plan and the types of crops.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:37):**  And it must be economically feasible also.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:40):**  What do you need for a hundred hectares in the Netherlands for an experience farm as  
**[0:36:43-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:43):**  an investment?  
**[0:36:44-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:44):**  I'm asking very bluntly.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:45):**  A million.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:46):**  Which, I mean, I'm not saying I have it in my back pocket, but yeah.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:51):**  And here in the area where we live, it's almost a hundred thousand euros per hectare.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:57):**  So if you want a hundred hectares, it's a million plus the buildings.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:01):**  Running costs and everything.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:03):**  It's not just that.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:04):**  Plus the bio-fertilizer, because just for clarity, when you say we make our own bio-fertilizer,  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:09):**  how many litres do you make?  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:10):**  Because it's not one little pan somewhere that some farmers I know use.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:14):**  This is almost a brewery basically.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:16):**  Yeah, it is a brewery.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:18):**  And as an employee working on that full time, three days a week during the growing season,  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:25):**  three to four days a week.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:28):**  And then also we make our own compost tea.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:31):**  Compost tea is a process of 24 hours and making bio-fertilizers is a process of several months  
**[0:37:40-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:40):**  when you have a batch ready.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:42):**  So we make a batch for a thousand litres and it's about making your bio-fertilizer mainly  
**[0:37:50-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:50):**  through the whole year and storage it.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:52):**  The good thing about bio-fertilizer is you can storage it as long as it's in a dark place  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:59):**  and it's not getting there too hot and it's not getting there below zero.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:04):**  So that's a good thing.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:05):**  You can make it in advance.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:07):**  But we use thousands and thousands of litres of bio-fertilizer and it's mainly looking  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:14):**  like a factory on its own.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:18):**  And above that, the compost tea.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:20):**  So the compost tea is usually, for instance, sprayed every eight to 10 days.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:27):**  And if you use that on 360 hectares, yeah, you can imagine how much that must be.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:33):**  And if there is one thing you could change in the agriculture and food system or in general,  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:38):**  but let's say agriculture and food.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:39):**  So you have a magic wand, you have a magic power to change something overnight.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:42):**  We wake up tomorrow morning and Melanie has changed one thing in the food system and agriculture  
**[0:38:47-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:47):**  system.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:48):**  What would that be?  
**[0:38:49-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:49):**  Yeah, I would like to change from the quantity focus within industrial farming towards the  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:57):**  quality of the products in industrial farming.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:00):**  So it's about the nutrients density in the products.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:03):**  It's about the diversity of the nutrients in the products, because what we see now is  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:10):**  farmers are only paid for the amount of food they are producing.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:15):**  They're not looking at the nutritional value of the food.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:19):**  They are not looking at the density of nutrition.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:22):**  So if I could change one thing, that would be the one.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:26):**  And also by just focusing on that one, knowing that there is a correlation between health  
**[0:39:32-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:32):**  source and the nutrient density and the diversification in nutrients in your products.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:38):**  Yeah, you will achieve what we are looking for and that's building source again.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:43):**  And for the non-farmers listening to this, and I hope there are many obviously investors  
**[0:39:48-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:48):**  either managing their own money or managing other people's money listening to this without  
**[0:39:52-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:52):**  giving investment advice, because obviously that's not what we're doing here.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:55):**  But what would you advise and nudge them towards to look at as you are in this journey, there's  
**[0:39:59-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:59):**  still a lot of unknowns, but there's still a lot of knowns already.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:02):**  What should investors focus on?  
**[0:40:04-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:04):**  Is that the nutrient part mostly?  
**[0:40:06-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:06):**  Is it machinery?  
**[0:40:07-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:07):**  Is it setting up independent agronomic advice?  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:09):**  What do you tell to people that come to your kitchen table now, still your kitchen table,  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:12):**  not the experience farm when they have a coffee and they say, okay, I'm ready.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:15):**  I'm ready to put money to work, to invest in this movement, but I don't know where.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:20):**  Help me.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:21):**  What do you tell them?  
**[0:40:22-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:23):**  I would say it would be definitely everything to make measurable and visible the amount  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:29):**  of nutrients in the products, because I think that's the end.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:33):**  That's also the thing you could say the product, which is going to consumers.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:38):**  There is the accelerating also to our big social and global community around us.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:44):**  Health problems are one of the biggest problems we have.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:48):**  So I would say everything aligned with make it nutrient density and diversification of  
**[0:40:56-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:56):**  nutrient visible and measurable.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:59):**  And the better we can do that, the more reliable, you know, also the outcome must be for soil  
**[0:41:05-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:05):**  improvement.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:07):**  So if we can really measure and make it visible that things are changing in the nutrient density  
**[0:41:14-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:14):**  and in the different diversification of nutrients, we really know that the soil is getting healthier  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:21):**  also.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:22):**  And so would that be also your focus?  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:25):**  If you would be, let's say in charge of a large investment fund, let's say a billion  
**[0:41:29-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:29):**  dollars or billion euros, would that be on the experience farm part?  
**[0:41:32-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:32):**  Would it really be on a lot of measurement of nutrient density or both?  
**[0:41:36-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:36):**  Like what would you focus on if you would be in charge of quite a large investment amount?  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:40):**  So there are investments could be very, very long term.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:43):**  But how would you put that to work in the different sectors you're actively?  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:47):**  Yeah, first, if you want to communicate that it's the fact, then you need to do base it  
**[0:41:52-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:52):**  on research.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:53):**  So that's also why at the experience farm now, we are starting with the research project.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:59):**  But after that, I think it's about communication and it's about, yeah, maybe big market communication  
**[0:42:08-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:08):**  activities.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:09):**  To show this potato is not the same as that potato and this tomato.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:13):**  Yes.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:14):**  And not only for farmers to empower them to have a better negotiation level with the retail,  
**[0:42:21-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:21):**  but also to governments.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:22):**  I think governments also play a very big role in this also for consumers.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:27):**  So because a lot of change only exists because consumers asked it, consumers demands it.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:35):**  A lot of things about nutrition and food and soils are not known at all by consumers.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:42):**  So there's a big power there in consumers also when they are getting informed about  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:48):**  these practices.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:49):**  And then, of course, I think there are a lot of organizations and retail companies who  
**[0:42:55-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:55):**  are also, we will be seeing the benefit of this and maybe start a transition also so  
**[0:43:02-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:02):**  we can achieve the transition from the quantity towards quality.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:08):**  And what do you think of all this attention that I think the last 18 months specifically  
**[0:43:13-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:13):**  on carbon, like it seems to be the only thing that matters.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:16):**  And suddenly the world sort of wakes up to the potential of carbon.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:19):**  But you very specifically have been talking about nutrients and water and biodiversity  
**[0:43:23-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:23):**  and very little on carbon.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:24):**  What do you think of all the hype I almost would actually definitely go with hype around  
**[0:43:29-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:29):**  the focus on carbon and soils?  
**[0:43:31-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:31):**  Yes.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:32):**  It's a pity that carbon is the only currency now for the services which the soil can provide  
**[0:43:38-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:38):**  us.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:39):**  So we're talking in research, we are talking about ecosystem services.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:44):**  So if we're talking about carbon sequestration from a farmer's perspective, this is not the  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:50):**  very interesting ecosystem services he's dealing with.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:54):**  If you're talking from a perspective of a farmer, and I think that is the really strong  
**[0:43:59-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:59):**  point from the Soul Heroes Foundation is we want to empower farmers.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:03):**  It's more about water holding capacity and have risk management on drought periods, have  
**[0:44:09-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:09):**  risk management on to wet periods.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:12):**  So increasing water holding capacity is for them much more important than carbon sequestration.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:20):**  The same is with bio, you could say the biodiversity part because it increases natural resilience  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:27):**  and therefore they can provide us with healthier crops and they don't need to apply as much  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:33):**  as plant protection products as they did in the last few years.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:38):**  But also the nutrient part because then you empower again the farmer with a negotiation  
**[0:44:45-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:45):**  with retail.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:46):**  With carbon you don't.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:47):**  Do you think people that are now getting hyped about carbon will at some point see that the  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:53):**  other layers will get excited and then hopefully transition to, let's say, a deeper understanding  
**[0:44:57-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:57):**  of all the other benefits?  
**[0:44:59-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:59):**  Like, is it a good gateway drug to start?  
**[0:45:01-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:01):**  Okay, and then you get hooked and you go deeper and deeper?  
**[0:45:04-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:04):**  Are you scared that people get super excited and then if they don't see the results immediately  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:09):**  that everybody's promising, like we can save the climate by farming differently and storing  
**[0:45:13-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:13):**  all the carbon, that it would start for looking for something else?  
**[0:45:16-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:16):**  Or what do you see happening?  
**[0:45:17-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:17):**  Do people go deeper?  
**[0:45:18-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:18):**  Yeah, I certainly think that carbon and the carbon sequestration market opened the first  
**[0:45:23-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:23):**  doors that people were aware of the ecosystem services, which are depleting now because  
**[0:45:30-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:30):**  our soils are depleting.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:31):**  But yeah, for looking at the real validation of those ecosystem services, it's a pity that  
**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:39):**  only carbon sequestration is now a form of payment.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:44):**  And it's again very strong based on maintaining industrial ways of producing, which we're  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:52):**  doing now.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:54):**  And what we are aiming for is going back to the natural basis.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:59):**  And that means we need to leave the industrial way of farming.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:02):**  So it goes beyond only carbon.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:06):**  And also the problems, especially which we have now in Europe, we have big drought and  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:12):**  heat in the south of Europe, pushes of burn, burns there.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:17):**  We have a very, very wet growing season here in the north of Europe.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:22):**  We are suffering floods here.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:24):**  We had a very big floods in Germany and in Belgium and also in the Netherlands.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:29):**  So also the ecosystem service of water holding capacity is becoming to be an issue.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:35):**  It's probably more important than carbon at the moment.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:39):**  And if you are looking at biodiversity and nutrition, the European committee tries to  
**[0:46:46-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:46):**  make first steps in the ecosystems of the new cap, but it's a very, on a very shallow  
**[0:46:53-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:53):**  basis and we don't have the time.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:56):**  We need to speed up.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:57):**  And the only thing we can speed up is by gaining the knowledge and try to make farmers aware  
**[0:47:05-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:47:05):**  of that, that they can benefit from it also when they are improving their source and make  
**[0:47:12-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:47:12):**  it validation, economic feasible for them towards retail.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:47:16):**  But this is also about empowering farmers because now if you're looking at farmers,  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:47:21):**  they get beat by the financial system.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:47:24):**  They are totally pushed in a corner by retail.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:47:28):**  They are totally empowered by advisors, which are working for fertilizers company and plant  
**[0:47:34-0:47:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:47:34):**  protection products company.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:47:36):**  So it's a holistic system and it's not one solution.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:47:42):**  And what we want to do is first knowledge and a true empowering farmers make the transition  
**[0:47:48-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:47:48):**  to farm himself instead of the world above it or around us coming with solutions and  
**[0:47:56-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:47:56):**  working towards them because then we know it's never in the benefit of the farmer.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:02):**  And if we really want to make the transition in farming feasible, the farmer needs to lead  
**[0:48:09-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:09):**  it.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:11):**  That's a perfect way and a perfect moment to end this conversation.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:14):**  Thank you so much, Manali, for taking the time and sharing.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:17):**  And I hope the Experience Center and Farm will be there.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:21):**  We'll soon move out of your kitchen, let's say, and many more people will be able to  
**[0:48:24-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:24):**  experience it because it's also a capacity thing.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:27):**  And of course, if you're farming full time, you cannot constantly, even if you wanted  
**[0:48:31-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:31):**  to constantly show people around.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:33):**  And I think there are many people that want to visit and experience.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:36):**  So I am really much looking forward to that.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:38):**  And obviously on all the research pieces, I will link a lot of it below.

**[0:51:35-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:51:35):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture

**[0:52:06-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:52:06):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:52:08):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.

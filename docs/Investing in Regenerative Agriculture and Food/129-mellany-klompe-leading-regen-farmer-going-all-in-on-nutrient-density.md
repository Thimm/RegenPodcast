### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2021-08-31)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course, or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:13):**  One of the leading region farmers in Europe is building an experience center in the Netherlands  to show the connection between healthy soils, healthy produce, and healthy people, and empower  farmers to seek independent advice on a regenerative transition, not advice paid for by the chemical  
**[0:00:28-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:28):**  input industry.  So farmers can finally negotiate a better price with the retail industry based on quality,  not on quantity.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:38):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  planet mattered podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:51-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:00:51):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:04-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:04):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:15):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  our work.  And so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:22):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:46-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:46):**  who we had on one of the earlier podcasts.  She runs probably one of the most innovative farms in Western Europe.  She's also co founder of soil heroes and director of the soil heroes foundation.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:55):**  Welcome Melanie.  Hello, Koon.  Good morning.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:01:58):**  Good morning.  I'm so happy to have you on the show.  And I'm starting with a personal question, which I know in this case is a very interesting,  
**[0:02:05-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:05):**  very interesting journey that you had leading you to working very deeply on soil and on  farming.  But what has been that journey to farming?  
**[0:02:13-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:13):**  Yeah, I think it started with my study.  I studied environmental science at the time when I needed to choose which direction I  wanted to study it was or I wanted to make people healthier.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:27):**  So become a doctor or something else.  Or yeah, try to achieve a better world and make the world healthier.  So I choose the letter.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:38):**  And after I finished that education, I worked on several governmental organizations, primarily  on landscape biodiversity, and as we are and water here in the Netherlands, we have a specific  organization.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:02:56):**  It's called the water boards here.  And it's a very big governmental organization.  So you could say from that perspective, I always were involved with water, with soils  
**[0:03:09-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:09):**  and biodiversity.  And as we are living in the Netherlands, if you look at the rural countryside, it's always  about agriculture combined with all these elements.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:22):**  So yeah, the old things together, agriculture, soils, biodiversity, water.  Yeah, I created and developed my own interest.  And then because we have a farm at home, I'm also in the time between married farmer.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:39):**  I'm not a native farmer myself, but my husband is.  And if you talk to each other on the kitchen table, yeah, you could say the two worlds  big yeah, emerged together.  
**[0:03:52-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:03:52):**  And I discovered that the soil problems were huge for the farm.  And then together with my husband, yeah, we started to, you could say, on this journey  to see how we could make the soil healthier and better as we had discovered about 10 years  
**[0:04:11-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:11):**  ago, especially we suffered from a big, you could say, soil compaction, soil depletion,  or our organic matter was going down rapidly.  So yeah, from that point on, together with my husband, step by step, plot by plot, we  
**[0:04:29-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:29):**  added measures to create a systemic change in it.  And it meant for us that we need to do farming on a very different way than the conventional  way we were used to.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:42):**  And we also discovered that, for instance, advisors, the current advices, which we had  done around the farm could not help us with the systemic change.  So we needed to develop our own knowledge on that.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:04:57):**  And at that time when we started, the word regenerative farming was not known at all  here in the Netherlands.  And I think about seven years ago, that was the first time we discovered that there was  
**[0:05:09-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:09):**  a technique like regenerative agriculture.  And from that point on, yeah, I'm always telling the world, from that point on, you have a  word you can Google, and then the world opens up.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:22):**  And then everything becomes easier.  You're not alone anymore.  No, but we saw we were pretty alone in Northwest Europe.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:32):**  But we saw that farmers in, especially Australia and the center of America and South Africa  already were exploring and doing a reach and act practices.  And yeah, we read a lot about them.  
**[0:05:48-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:05:48):**  We got in contact with them and tried to step by step apply those measures also on our farm.  So that's how we began with our journey.  And do you remember what was the first step from the kitchen table discussions in the  
**[0:06:02-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:02):**  evenings during dinner, breakfast, etc, where you sort of started working together on that?  Like what was the first things you did in the field?  Like how did it get from the kitchen table to the field for the first time, which could  
**[0:06:14-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:14):**  be something very big, something very small?  Like what was the first pilot or the first trial or the first steps you did when you  realized, okay, our soil is going down.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:23):**  We don't want to leave farming and just give up.  I'm saying just between brackets because it's obviously not easy, but we want to do something  about it.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:31):**  What was the first step there?  Yeah, I think the first step, we are always looking at the practices with the lowest costs  and the biggest benefits.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:39):**  And if you're talking about that, it's about for us here in the Netherlands, it was about  aiming for 365 days of covered soils.  Just to give a bit of background, how big is the farm?  
**[0:06:52-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:06:52):**  I mean, I will link to it obviously in the show notes, but just to give a bit of background.  Yeah, we have an arable farm just 20 kilometers below Rotterdam.  It's one of the real specific regions in the Netherlands for arable farming.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:07):**  So there are a few, mostly in the Netherlands.  We have dairy farms.  There are more on the Netherlands and on the peat areas, but on the sea clay areas, there  
**[0:07:17-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:17):**  are some specific spots in the Netherlands and those are very useful and you could say  highly productive for arable farming.  And those are also the, you could say the areas where the potatoes are growing in the  
**[0:07:32-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:32):**  Netherlands.  You could say potatoes is our biggest export product together with the onions and the shallots.  And then in, you could say the areas with the lower quality.  
**[0:07:44-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:07:44):**  Yeah, they usually grow or the cereals on it or it's in the Netherlands and peat land.  So we are under one of those real specific arable plots.  We have a farm of 360 hectares for the Netherlands that is pretty big because the average in  
**[0:08:02-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:02):**  the Netherlands is about 100 hectares.  So we are more than three times bigger than that.  And yeah, that's also, you could say a bigger challenge to make the transition towards rich  
**[0:08:15-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:15):**  and egg possible because what we saw in examples is that a farms of a few hectares or just  10 or 20 hectares, it's much more easier to do the transition to what's rich and egg compared  with these, you could say highly industrial farming areas, which we are in margins, which  
**[0:08:38-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:38):**  we have here on the island.  So for us, what I would just tell you highly industrial, very efficient, heavily financially  based crop rotation plan.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:08:52):**  So the first steps were mainly about, okay, cover the soil 365 days.  So we started with cover crops.  It's beginning, it was just grass, but then soon later we saw that it was better to use  
**[0:09:06-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:06):**  a bigger variety of a cover crop.  So we looked at root structure.  So it's about more deep root name, a cover crops.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:15):**  Also looking at added values of cover crops, like a nitrogen fixing, but also, yeah, you  could say the more various your root system is, the better your soil structure can improve.  So that was the first thing we started with.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:33):**  And then also one of the other measures we cut out is that we, and that was more about  my knowledge from the waterboard is that I saw that the level of antibiotics in slurry  manure became very high.  
**[0:09:49-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:09:49):**  So we measured that for instance, in the water levels through the waterboard.  So basically what, instead of using artificial fertilizer, a lot of farmers are using slurry,  especially because we have a large dairy industry.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:01):**  No, no, no, in a conventional farming here in the Netherlands, they use artificial fertilizers  combined with slurry.  Coming from the dairy industry.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:12):**  Yeah, dairy or pigs industry.  And you were seeing that antibiotics coming, which they were feeding or they were giving  to these animals.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:21):**  You were seeing that in the water.  So it meant it went through the animals onto your land, into the water.  Yeah.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:27):**  And so through the manure, we saw that the, you could say our salts were being toscated  by antibiotics and the water around it.  Yeah.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:36):**  And, and with runoff and it came in the surface water and the waterboard was measuring that.  And because we are such a specific arable region, the only way it, antibiotics, which  have a reference to dairy must come from the manure.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:10:53):**  So I told my husband, yeah, and sorry, life is very important.  So let's cut out the slurry of manure and turn it to compost and only solid manure.  How difficult was that?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:05):**  Very difficult because it's not difficult to cut out the slurry manure, but to find  solid manure, that's a very big challenge because most farmers only have slurry manure,  solid manures only from farms, which you could say a very authentic way of farming.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:26):**  So they have the cows and the pig still on straw and not on a, on a surface where the  concrete, where the slurry goes through.  Because that's where they mix the manure with the liquid and then you get a slurry.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:40):**  And then you have the separations.  Yeah.  So that's, what's the first challenge.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:45):**  And then we combined it with compost, but not any quality of compost.  You have big varieties of quality of compost.  We had it on the show before.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:54):**  Yeah.  It's it could be anything.  Yeah.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:11:57):**  We were very critical about that.  And did you see the antibiotics going down because with a solid manure, is there less  antibiotics in it or it's less prone to runoff?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:06):**  Did you see that as an effect also on the land and the water around?  Yeah, that's because there are so much farms around us.  We can't measure the difference, but it is only about my knowledge that I know that in  
**[0:12:17-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:17):**  slurry manure, the antibiotics level is much higher than solid manure.  So that's why for our soils, we want to detoxify it.  And those were the two steps to start with.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:31):**  And now like when you're looking, because you have many fields that are in almost all  the fields are in transition somewhere.  And when we look, this was quite a few years ago when you started with this.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:41):**  Now, when you look at the most advanced fields, the fields that are by far the most, let's  say onwards in this journey, what are you doing there different than let's say a neighbor  that's on a field next door?  
**[0:12:51-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:12:51):**  How can we as non-farmers, if we're listening, if we would stand there and we would stand  there maybe for a year, what would we see as difference compared to the neighbor that's  doing things convention?  
**[0:13:01-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:01):**  Yeah.  From the foundation, we created guidebook for 20 principles.  And from those 20 principles now on the most advanced plots, we apply 16 of them.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:14):**  So that's, you could say, what makes this difference than the neighbor is that, yeah,  maybe those 16 practices we are doing.  And those four, now I'm curious, obviously, because I think we can, I will link obviously  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:27):**  to the guidebook.  What are the things you are not doing yet and why?  Yeah.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:31):**  The thing we are not doing yet is integration.  And that's also the regional problem to combine it with cows or have a collaboration with  a dairy farm where you can, you could say rent cows or pigs or, or sheeps.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:45):**  Yeah.  They are more than 60 kilometers away.  So that gives a very big challenge.  
**[0:13:50-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:13:50):**  So we are not doing that yet.  We try to substitute that with applying bio fertilizer and make our own bio fertilizer.  And one, you can make various recipes of bio fertilize.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:04):**  And one of them is you can make one from solid manure.  So you can have the advantage of all the fungi and biological activities and multiply it  via bio fertilize and then spray it on the fields.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:20):**  So that is how we try to substitute them.  Also one of them is use your own, you could say growing material.  So if you harvest potatoes, keep your potato separate and then use the baby potatoes to  
**[0:14:35-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:35):**  seed the year after that again, because if you are able to do that, you will build up  a natural resilience in your primarily product.  You could say the seeds you are using.  
**[0:14:48-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:14:48):**  We are not allowed to do that in the Netherlands because all seed material must be certified.  And yeah, we don't have that capacity and that facilitation here on the farm.  So we can get all our seed material certified.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:07):**  And if we are not producing food from certified seed, we are not allowed to sell our products  to the retail.  So that's more like keeping it closed.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:20):**  So that's one else.  And then yeah, you could say practices like the ultimate way is agroforestry that you  also integrate trees on your plots in lanes and bushes.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:34):**  We are not there yet.  This is the first year we experienced, we did some experience with lane farming.  When you could say loin farming is a first step towards agroforestry.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:47):**  So integrate more trees.  And what is lane farming just for people that the different lanes next to each other are  different crops or is that very simple?  
**[0:15:56-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:15:56):**  Yes.  So it's not one field of x meters by x meters?  No, you're not doing monocultures on a plot.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:04):**  So for instance, we started with, you could say our most advanced region ag plot with  this.  It's a plot of 20 hectares.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:13):**  And on that 20 hectares, we grow five different crops and lanes like six meters broad.  Also we integrated some biodiversity lanes in them, also to increase the natural resilience  of that plot.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:29):**  And by doing that, you could say you make your plants more resilient because you don't  have a monoculture.  So diseases and plagues don't have that much to hold on when it's only a strip of six meters  
**[0:16:45-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:16:45):**  and another crop is alongside it.  And if you choose it right, it can empower the other crops.  So it's also about looking at which a crop can be a companion in natural resilience to  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:00):**  other crops.  And how did that go the first year?  I mean, it's early still, but how did, what's your first, I mean, it's tricky for sure,  
**[0:17:07-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:07):**  because like planning wise, you need to be really, and movements of machines, et cetera,  need to be orchestrated in an absolutely perfect way.  Yeah, but that's also, we are working with GPS and controlled traffic farming, so we  
**[0:17:22-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:22):**  are already there.  So that's also one of the practices we apply in the farm.  But what we see now, if for instance, in the lane farming, we also grow our own soybeans  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:33):**  because we also produce soy sauce.  Yeah, we had Bert on the show.  I will link it below as well.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:38):**  Yeah, from Thomasu.  And what we see now is that we did not spray anything on the soy field.  We had some problems with snails and then we made a bio fertilizer based on garlic and  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:53):**  we spray that on it.  And then the problem was solved.  And that was mainly the only problem we had.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:17:59):**  And the plants are looking so healthy and big.  We did not see them that big because we also have a plot, a mono plot, a monoculture plot  with soybeans.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:09):**  So you can easily compare, even though it's not the same plot and it's not in the same  journey, but you can.  Yeah, but the plants in the lane farm looks much bigger.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:18):**  The leaves looks bigger.  The plants are bigger.  So you see that the plant is much healthier than it is compared with the plot with the  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:27):**  monoculture on it.  Wow.  And that's in one year.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:31):**  So you start tweaking the recipe further and find even better companions or, and then how  to, I mean, the rotation becomes a bigger puzzle, but yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:40):**  And in the winter, we also on the same lanes, we sowing different types of cover crops.  For instance, for the soy, we wanted to sow in nitrogen fixing cover crops.  So we will capture nitrogen on a natural way into the soil.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:18:55):**  And when you grow next year, the soil on that, the soil can benefit from the nitrogen, which  is yeah, you could say fixed in the soil for them.  So on that way, you can cut out a artificial fertilizer also.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:10):**  And there are a lot of, if you have wheat problems, for instance, you can use other  cover crops to suppress those wheat problems.  And so yeah, I have the benefit of that the year after when you are sowing your cash for.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:26):**  And with all these experiments and all this work you're doing and transitioning all these  plots, what was the reason to set up a foundation next to the farm and next to the work at Soy  Heroes and of course, next to work at Tommaso, what was the reason to set up a non for profit  
**[0:19:42-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:42):**  on the farm, but next to the farm as a company farm?  Yeah, well, mainly because we experienced, as I told you that in Northwest Europe, rich  and ag farming is not known at all.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:19:54):**  And if we're looking at the system here, especially in the Netherlands, but also in Belgium, mainly,  it's all the advisors have the connection with the supply chain or the artificial fertilizers  or the plant protection product.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:08):**  So the agronomists, the ones that need to help and work alongside the farmers at the  end of the day are paid through the industry, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but  you know what they're selling.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:17):**  That's their...  Yeah.  And it is in their benefit.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:22):**  You don't try other things and divide from their track.  Or other companies or make your own bio fertilizer like you're doing.  Yeah.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:29):**  So they don't like that.  Maybe that's a little bit bad to say, but they sell fear and they sell risk.  So if you're telling a farmer, you're taking a risk, not by spraying, you should be afraid  
**[0:20:44-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:44):**  because your neighbor has played this.  Maybe you also need to spray.  So the plague don't come to your crop.  
**[0:20:52-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:20:52):**  That's their job.  So they're telling you all things about risk management, about safety to protect your crops  against plagues and diseases without it's really in your field, but just in case of,  
**[0:21:07-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:07):**  we saw, okay, we need an independent place where people can come for knowledge about  region egg.  So that's why we started the foundation.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:17):**  So it's primarily, you could say to empower farmers in knowledge, in education about a  region egg practices.  So we try to provide it via the documents we are producing.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:30):**  For instance, the 20 principles we have now on our website, also on the experience farm,  we receive a lot of, welcome a lot of farmers and organizations who wants to look at how  we are doing because farmers really like to hear from other farmers, how they are doing  
**[0:21:47-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:47):**  it because it's really farm management related.  And so that's one thing.  And also we do a lot of projects on the farm to really make region egg practices and the  
**[0:21:59-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:21:59):**  improvement of soil, feasible and measurable because the more you can show them and more  it's measurable.  Yeah.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:09):**  The higher you could say the reliability is for them that it's working and they should  try it also.  And so I think the measurement piece is absolutely essential as we often hear anecdotally stories  
**[0:22:22-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:22):**  of farmers that are in some kind of transition, but then if you don't have the data underneath,  it's really difficult to persuade or encourage others to start as well.  So what on the measurement part, what are you focusing on to show and to make public  
**[0:22:36-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:36):**  in this, this massive transition that the farm is on?  What has been the measurement pieces you're working on?  Yeah, you could say in Soul Heroes, we started with the focus on four teams.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:46):**  So it's about carbon sequestration.  It's about water holding capacity, biodiversity and nutrition.  And on the first three elements like the carbon sequestration, water holding capacity and  
**[0:22:59-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:22:59):**  by the first three we have now already projects running on the farm.  We collaborate with, yeah, you could say, scientific partners on that with the University  of Wageningen and the University of Amsterdam on that.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:15):**  What has been the biggest surprise?  Because we often hear now in the scientific community or we often that they are actually  that some of the leading farmers in the Regen Ag movement are almost ahead of what's happening  
**[0:23:26-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:26):**  in the university plots or university farms.  So what has been your biggest surprise working with these?  What have you seen coming out that you may be expecting that they didn't or the other  
**[0:23:35-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:35):**  way around?  Well, my first experience is that they were surprised that they were, you could say, approached  by farmers to do this research instead of the other way around.  
**[0:23:48-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:23:48):**  Basically university comes to farmers that they want to do some investigation.  I think that also meant that we wanted especially to have scientific based research on a very  practical base.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:02):**  So it's about the lowest barriers for farmers.  It's about gathering data which farmers understand, but a lot of farmers already are able to gather  those data in a very easy way.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:16):**  A lot of farmers, for instance, here in the Netherlands already have a lot of sensors.  They can do very easy soil analysis at their farm.  And with those data, then we can provide them with, that's what we're working on, on a real  
**[0:24:33-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:33):**  outcome to measure water holding capacity and carbon sequestration.  And for biodiversity, it's mainly about, yeah, real counting biodiversity activity on your  farm.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:47):**  So it's counting all the insects.  It's also counting macrofauna in the canals alongside the plots and see what the differences  are.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:24:56):**  See how far the biodiversity power is divided from those, for instance, biodiversity lanes.  Yeah, you published something on that recently, right?  There's some research coming out on that.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:06):**  Yeah.  It's about designing your plots.  Especially with this lane farming as well to really, so you're just in, just out of  
**[0:25:14-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:14):**  clarity, a biodiversity lane is a lane that you have either around the farm or also integrated  into plots that is not being harvested, but it's primarily being seeded with a mix of  different plants and flowers, et cetera, to help biodiversity, a lot of insects mainly.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:29):**  And this research was to look at what's the effect, like how far do these insects actually  travel and help the plants?  And when do you need to plan your next biodiversity lane to have the full effect on the plots  
**[0:25:38-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:38):**  that are next door?  Yeah.  And the research of Wageningen University, of the Amsterdam University, who's helping  
**[0:25:46-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:25:46):**  us is mainly in potatoes because the potato is the economic, the most important crop for  us and what they choose to look at the aphids population in potatoes and see how much aphids  looser.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:02):**  It's an insect.  Yeah.  Okay.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:05):**  So it's one that you don't want, right?  That's just the way.  Yeah.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:09):**  Yeah.  And how much from such a biodiversity element, the aphids populations is suppressed by a  natural pest control.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:19):**  And how far was that?  Like how far did these insects fly and ate these aphids from the plant or somehow suppress  them?  
**[0:26:26-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:26):**  We are now in the third year.  And what we see now is that it's about 100, 150 meters.  Which is far.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:34):**  Yeah.  And if you have, for instance, on the side, the only field margins, you're by the diversity  lane, you need to have such a lane every 300 meters.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:46):**  And then you could say your crops is covered a bit for the natural pest control.  So those are the first outcomes we are now having.  And pollination, it even goes further.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:26:58):**  But we see that plots or plants who don't have access to natural pollination, we do  that research in our soya bean fields.  And we see that those plants are producing 30 to 40% less in weight of beans compared  
**[0:27:17-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:17):**  with the plants who have access to a natural pollination.  So it really means something.  Which means that you can make that calculation of, okay, I'm losing, losing between brackets.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:28):**  A few meters of a biodiversity lane, but I'm getting 30 or somewhere like a lot more in  terms of soya bean weight, which is a very important measure.  And then you can make the calculation, which probably falls in favor of hiring insects  
**[0:27:41-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:41):**  for the job.  Yeah.  So it's more about what we add to the research of the universities that needs to be practical,  
**[0:27:49-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:27:49):**  doable by the farmer himself.  Clots that cost intensive because a lot of research done by university and when the farmers  want to apply them, they're really cost intensive.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:02):**  And it also must be doable for them.  They must understand what they are doing.  And also because when they understand what they are doing, when they understand the outcome  
**[0:28:12-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:12):**  of the data, they really see the improvement.  And then they also get encouraged to go further with more measures or do it on more plots.  And the same is with, for instance, the research on biodiversity.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:24):**  If you combine it with the elements economics, and you will have a very powerful instrument  because it's not about on ecology, it's also about economy.  And those were the elements we are looking for here at the farm.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:40):**  And the third team we want to start this autumn is a big nutrition project.  Mainly it's about if your soils are healthier or become healthier, you will see that the  dynamics in soil are increasing between also the plants and the products and soil.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:28:59):**  So there are a lot of literature available already where everybody is telling about if  you get healthy soil, you get a healthy plant, you get a healthy product.  Okay, how can we make that measurable and visible?  
**[0:29:15-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:15):**  In your circumstances, in your context?  Yeah.  And together with Dr. Jill Kleppertrom from the USA, she has developed a great system  
**[0:29:24-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:24):**  for that.  And it's all based on measuring nutrients in the soil, measuring the same nutrients  done in the plant and in the products.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:34):**  And if the soil is healthy, the transition must be there.  And you must see the correlation between the nutrients in the soil, in the plant and in  the products.  
**[0:29:45-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:29:45):**  So what we want to do with research is not only provide with evidence that the better  the balance is reached in soil, the better the correlation is between those three elements,  but also we want to show that the density of those nutrients and the difference between  
**[0:30:05-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:05):**  the nutrients, so more nutrients in the products is achieved.  And if we can do that, I think we have very powerful research for farmers to have a communication  with the retail because they then really can say, I've grown my potatoes on a regen egg  
**[0:30:25-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:25):**  whey.  My potatoes have a higher nutrition level than just a conventional grown potato.  I've got a research paper here from Sol Harris Foundation who says that.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:38):**  And I want you to pay me more because I did a bigger and a greater job.  So that's what we want to achieve with the last project.  Super interesting.  
**[0:30:48-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:30:48):**  And very concretely, you're looking for funding for that.  So anybody interested in showing this relationship between healthy soil, healthy plant, healthy  produce, and then we go, as I know, Joe Klepperta and I will put the interview below as well.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:01):**  We had her on the show.  Thanks to you guys, by the way.  She's also working with Dan Barber who also should be out soon or is already out for this  
**[0:31:08-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:08):**  interview when you're listening to this, but showing that relationship then with healthy  people, healthy gut system and healthy people and then healthy ecosystem.  That line is very, very strong and needs to be shown everywhere.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:18):**  It cannot be shown just in grain somewhere.  It needs to be shown also in potatoes and also in soybeans and also in onions because  we need, as you're selling your huge farm, you're selling mostly to retail.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:28):**  You're not selling directly on a farmer's market, which is impossible.  We need to have an argument to the retail saying, okay, this is not the same potato  as the other potato.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:36):**  This is a fundamentally different thing.  And thus we need to have a discussion about price and because it has a different benefit  to your end consumer.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:43):**  And so that's, it's absolutely essential research that we have to do.  It's nice you mentioned Dan Barber because Jill is also very connected with Dan.  She wants to do this research also on the farm from Dan Barber.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:31:55):**  Then she wants to do the research on our farm, on our experience farm, you could say.  And then probably also in a farm in Finland.  So you've got like a more colder continent.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:07):**  You've got the, you could say the Northwest Europe continent, sea clay, and then she wants  to do it on a continental climate based farm and from Dan Barber.  So by combining those three research projects, you could say, it's also building up a higher  
**[0:32:27-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:27):**  reliability if it's done on three different farms and three different types of soils,  because then you really can show that the relation and the correlation is there.  You've mentioned the experience farm a few times.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:40):**  What's your vision there?  What's already there?  I mean, people can experience the farm literally, but there's a bigger vision to be built.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:46):**  I mean, people can, I've done that other people I know, you, you go on a tour, you see many  different different, interesting things, but your vision on the experience farm, I think  is bigger than what it is now and just to visit the farm.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:32:58):**  So what's your vision on making sure that people can really experience this and mainly  farmers and other people from the food sector, obviously like retail needs to experience  this as well, but let's start with farmers.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:08):**  What should they experience in your vision of an experience farm?  The experience farm is our own farm and that has his limits because we also have a very  highly economic pressure on the farm.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:20):**  You could say it's a family farm.  So our highest ambition is to have an independence experience center with his own fields around  it where we can experiment on a much higher level than we do now, because now we always  
**[0:33:35-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:35):**  need to be aware of the current farm management itself.  We also need to rely on our own employees for that.  But from my perspective, we really need an independent place.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:49):**  Which is not selling anything.  Yeah.  And also, just to be honest, it's now in my house.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:33:56):**  It's in our home.  Which is nice until it's not nice anymore.  No, no.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:03):**  So an independent place where we can 100% focus on this with experience fields around  it, giving students a full time 365 days, providing them an experience field research  area.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:20):**  How big are you imagining?  How many hectares do you think is ideal in your context to show stuff?  Is it 20?  
**[0:34:26-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:26):**  Is it 50?  Yeah, because we really want to be an example for the large-scale farms.  As I told you, that is the biggest problem.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:35):**  And I think if you are aiming for the big change, then you need to aim for the industrial  way of farming.  So we need to aim for bigger farms.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:44):**  Because it's the biggest amount of hectares and the biggest amount of antibiotics and  the biggest amount of spraying.  I would say a farm of 100 hectares then must be the example, the ideal example.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:34:58):**  So having such an experience farm started here in Northwest Europe because I think we  have a lot of farmers to convince here.  Also it's the area where a lot of industrial farming has been done.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:11):**  But then also, if you look at a wider global perspective, I also think that per climate  zone or per types of farm, I also think that for instance, for dairy, there's a totally  different scope of measure, scope of focus for transition towards rich and ag.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:32):**  So it's not only, we want to start with our own arable experience farm, but I think we  also in the end need to look at different global zones and also different types of farming.  And do you see any business model there?  
**[0:35:48-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:48):**  I'm asking because I always love to ask the question, what would you do with a billion  dollars?  And it sounds like you would focus on experience farms, but do you see any way a business model  
**[0:35:56-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:35:56):**  or it would really be experienced farms need to be, I mean, they need to be independent  for sure, but they also need to be a non-for-profit or they shouldn't have to focus.  Like what do you see there?  
**[0:36:05-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:05):**  Is there any way, because it's maybe a lot easier to start many of these if there is  some kind of small, even very small business model and you don't need to raise only grant  funding for it.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:14):**  Or will it be blended?  What do you think?  No, I think the aim is that it's a farm which provides profit because otherwise we don't  
**[0:36:23-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:23):**  empower farmers.  From the farming properly, from the farming system as a whole.  And that's also why I think the experience farm needs to be about 100 hectares because  
**[0:36:33-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:33):**  of a crop rotation plan and the types of crops.  And it must be economically feasible also.  What do you need for a hundred hectares in the Netherlands for an experience farm as  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:43):**  an investment?  I'm asking very bluntly.  A million.  
**[0:36:46-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:36:46):**  Which, I mean, I'm not saying I have it in my back pocket, but yeah.  And here in the area where we live, it's almost a hundred thousand euros per hectare.  So if you want a hundred hectares, it's a million plus the buildings.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:01):**  Running costs and everything.  It's not just that.  Plus the bio-fertilizer, because just for clarity, when you say we make our own bio-fertilizer,  
**[0:37:09-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:09):**  how many litres do you make?  Because it's not one little pan somewhere that some farmers I know use.  This is almost a brewery basically.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:16):**  Yeah, it is a brewery.  And as an employee working on that full time, three days a week during the growing season,  three to four days a week.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:28):**  And then also we make our own compost tea.  Compost tea is a process of 24 hours and making bio-fertilizers is a process of several months  when you have a batch ready.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:42):**  So we make a batch for a thousand litres and it's about making your bio-fertilizer mainly  through the whole year and storage it.  The good thing about bio-fertilizer is you can storage it as long as it's in a dark place  
**[0:37:59-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:37:59):**  and it's not getting there too hot and it's not getting there below zero.  So that's a good thing.  You can make it in advance.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:07):**  But we use thousands and thousands of litres of bio-fertilizer and it's mainly looking  like a factory on its own.  And above that, the compost tea.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:20):**  So the compost tea is usually, for instance, sprayed every eight to 10 days.  And if you use that on 360 hectares, yeah, you can imagine how much that must be.  And if there is one thing you could change in the agriculture and food system or in general,  
**[0:38:38-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:38):**  but let's say agriculture and food.  So you have a magic wand, you have a magic power to change something overnight.  We wake up tomorrow morning and Melanie has changed one thing in the food system and agriculture  
**[0:38:47-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:47):**  system.  What would that be?  Yeah, I would like to change from the quantity focus within industrial farming towards the  
**[0:38:57-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:38:57):**  quality of the products in industrial farming.  So it's about the nutrients density in the products.  It's about the diversity of the nutrients in the products, because what we see now is  
**[0:39:10-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:10):**  farmers are only paid for the amount of food they are producing.  They're not looking at the nutritional value of the food.  They are not looking at the density of nutrition.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:22):**  So if I could change one thing, that would be the one.  And also by just focusing on that one, knowing that there is a correlation between health  source and the nutrient density and the diversification in nutrients in your products.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:38):**  Yeah, you will achieve what we are looking for and that's building source again.  And for the non-farmers listening to this, and I hope there are many obviously investors  either managing their own money or managing other people's money listening to this without  
**[0:39:52-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:39:52):**  giving investment advice, because obviously that's not what we're doing here.  But what would you advise and nudge them towards to look at as you are in this journey, there's  still a lot of unknowns, but there's still a lot of knowns already.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:02):**  What should investors focus on?  Is that the nutrient part mostly?  Is it machinery?  
**[0:40:07-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:07):**  Is it setting up independent agronomic advice?  What do you tell to people that come to your kitchen table now, still your kitchen table,  not the experience farm when they have a coffee and they say, okay, I'm ready.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:15):**  I'm ready to put money to work, to invest in this movement, but I don't know where.  Help me.  What do you tell them?  
**[0:40:22-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:22):**  Yeah.  I would say it would be definitely everything to make measurable and visible the amount  of nutrients in the products, because I think that's the end.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:33):**  That's also the thing you could say the product, which is going to consumers.  There is the accelerating also to our big social and global community around us.  Health problems are one of the biggest problems we have.  
**[0:40:48-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:40:48):**  So I would say everything aligned with make it nutrient density and diversification of  nutrient visible and measurable.  And the better we can do that, the more reliable, you know, also the outcome must be for soil  
**[0:41:05-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:05):**  improvement.  So if we can really measure and make it visible that things are changing in the nutrient density  and in the different diversification of nutrients, we really know that the soil is getting healthier  
**[0:41:21-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:21):**  also.  And so would that be also your focus?  If you would be, let's say in charge of a large investment fund, let's say a billion  
**[0:41:29-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:29):**  dollars or billion euros, would that be on the experience farm part?  Would it really be on a lot of measurement of nutrient density or both?  Like what would you focus on if you would be in charge of quite a large investment amount?  
**[0:41:40-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:40):**  So there are investments could be very, very long term.  But how would you put that to work in the different sectors you're actively?  Yeah, first, if you want to communicate that it's the fact, then you need to do base it  
**[0:41:52-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:41:52):**  on research.  So that's also why at the experience farm now, we are starting with the research project.  But after that, I think it's about communication and it's about, yeah, maybe big market communication  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:08):**  activities.  To show this potato is not the same as that potato and this tomato.  Yes.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:14):**  And not only for farmers to empower them to have a better negotiation level with the retail,  but also to governments.  I think governments also play a very big role in this also for consumers.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:27):**  So because a lot of change only exists because consumers asked it, consumers demands it.  A lot of things about nutrition and food and soils are not known at all by consumers.  So there's a big power there in consumers also when they are getting informed about  
**[0:42:48-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:42:48):**  these practices.  And then, of course, I think there are a lot of organizations and retail companies who  are also, we will be seeing the benefit of this and maybe start a transition also so  
**[0:43:02-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:02):**  we can achieve the transition from the quantity towards quality.  And what do you think of all this attention that I think the last 18 months specifically  on carbon, like it seems to be the only thing that matters.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:16):**  And suddenly the world sort of wakes up to the potential of carbon.  But you very specifically have been talking about nutrients and water and biodiversity  and very little on carbon.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:24):**  What do you think of all the hype I almost would actually definitely go with hype around  the focus on carbon and soils?  Yes.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:32):**  It's a pity that carbon is the only currency now for the services which the soil can provide  us.  So we're talking in research, we are talking about ecosystem services.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:44):**  So if we're talking about carbon sequestration from a farmer's perspective, this is not the  very interesting ecosystem services he's dealing with.  If you're talking from a perspective of a farmer, and I think that is the really strong  
**[0:43:59-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:43:59):**  point from the Soul Heroes Foundation is we want to empower farmers.  It's more about water holding capacity and have risk management on drought periods, have  risk management on to wet periods.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:12):**  So increasing water holding capacity is for them much more important than carbon sequestration.  The same is with bio, you could say the biodiversity part because it increases natural resilience  and therefore they can provide us with healthier crops and they don't need to apply as much  
**[0:44:33-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:33):**  as plant protection products as they did in the last few years.  But also the nutrient part because then you empower again the farmer with a negotiation  with retail.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:46):**  With carbon you don't.  Do you think people that are now getting hyped about carbon will at some point see that the  other layers will get excited and then hopefully transition to, let's say, a deeper understanding  
**[0:44:57-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:44:57):**  of all the other benefits?  Like, is it a good gateway drug to start?  Okay, and then you get hooked and you go deeper and deeper?  
**[0:45:04-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:04):**  Are you scared that people get super excited and then if they don't see the results immediately  that everybody's promising, like we can save the climate by farming differently and storing  all the carbon, that it would start for looking for something else?  
**[0:45:16-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:16):**  Or what do you see happening?  Do people go deeper?  Yeah, I certainly think that carbon and the carbon sequestration market opened the first  
**[0:45:23-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:23):**  doors that people were aware of the ecosystem services, which are depleting now because  our soils are depleting.  But yeah, for looking at the real validation of those ecosystem services, it's a pity that  
**[0:45:39-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:39):**  only carbon sequestration is now a form of payment.  And it's again very strong based on maintaining industrial ways of producing, which we're  doing now.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:45:54):**  And what we are aiming for is going back to the natural basis.  And that means we need to leave the industrial way of farming.  So it goes beyond only carbon.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:06):**  And also the problems, especially which we have now in Europe, we have big drought and  heat in the south of Europe, pushes of burn, burns there.  We have a very, very wet growing season here in the north of Europe.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:22):**  We are suffering floods here.  We had a very big floods in Germany and in Belgium and also in the Netherlands.  So also the ecosystem service of water holding capacity is becoming to be an issue.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:35):**  It's probably more important than carbon at the moment.  Yeah.  And if you are looking at biodiversity and nutrition, the European committee tries to  
**[0:46:46-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:46):**  make first steps in the ecosystems of the new cap, but it's a very, on a very shallow  basis and we don't have the time.  We need to speed up.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:46:57):**  And the only thing we can speed up is by gaining the knowledge and try to make farmers aware  of that, that they can benefit from it also when they are improving their source and make  it validation, economic feasible for them towards retail.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:47:16):**  But this is also about empowering farmers because now if you're looking at farmers,  they get beat by the financial system.  They are totally pushed in a corner by retail.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:47:28):**  They are totally empowered by advisors, which are working for fertilizers company and plant  protection products company.  So it's a holistic system and it's not one solution.  
**[0:47:42-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:47:42):**  And what we want to do is first knowledge and a true empowering farmers make the transition  to farm himself instead of the world above it or around us coming with solutions and  working towards them because then we know it's never in the benefit of the farmer.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:02):**  And if we really want to make the transition in farming feasible, the farmer needs to lead  it.  Yeah.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:11):**  That's a perfect way and a perfect moment to end this conversation.  Thank you so much, Manali, for taking the time and sharing.  And I hope the Experience Center and Farm will be there.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:21):**  We'll soon move out of your kitchen, let's say, and many more people will be able to  experience it because it's also a capacity thing.  And of course, if you're farming full time, you cannot constantly, even if you wanted  
**[0:48:31-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:31):**  to constantly show people around.  And I think there are many people that want to visit and experience.  So I am really much looking forward to that.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:38):**  And obviously on all the research pieces, I will link a lot of it below.  And in the show notes on the website.  But thank you so much for taking the time today.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:45):**  And we'll be definitely checking in on all these fascinating pieces.  Okay.  Thanks to you all so Koon.  
**[0:48:52-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:48:52):**  And yeah, hope we will talk again soon on the Experience Farm.

**[0:49:46-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:49:46):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:49:56-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:49:56):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:50:10):**  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:50:17-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:50:17):**  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  What is happening in this space?  What should you read?  
**[0:50:23-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:50:23):**  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  
**[0:50:29-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:50:29):**  For whom is this course?  You the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  
**[0:50:40-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:50:40):**  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  designers, holistic management consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money

**[0:51:03-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:51:03):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:51:07):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:51:16):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:51:25):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:51:35):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky.  How to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest  
**[0:51:46-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:51:46):**  in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if  you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:51:57-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:51:57):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  
**[0:52:06-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:52:06):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mellany-klompe#t=0:52:14):**  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on

**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:00:19):**  Why land security over a long period of time is key to soil health and sustainability of  
**[0:00:25-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:00:25):**  farms.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:00:26):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:00:27):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:00:33):**  planet mattered podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:00:38):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:00:43):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:00:49):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:00:51):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:55-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:00:55):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:00:57):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:01:02):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:01:07):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:01:11):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:01:14):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:01:18):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:01:23):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:01:27):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:01:47):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:01:48):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:01:53):**  I'm Koon Vasaian, your host.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:01:54):**  Today I'm joined by Kevin Egoof, chief financial officer of the Aquarius Valley Farms, a restorative  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:00):**  farmland finance company providing land access to organic family farmers with a specific  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:05):**  focus on the next generation.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:07):**  Welcome Kevin.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:08):**  Thank you for having me.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:09):**  So to start, as I always do with a personal question, what brings you to the space?  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:14):**  What brings you to farming?  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:15):**  What brings you to the future of farming and regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:20):**  I think my path follows the path of a lot of people that are focused on sustainable  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:25):**  ag and that that is through food.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:28):**  And I really became connected more personally to farming and agriculture through eating.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:37):**  And it started when I left college and had to start making food for myself.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:43):**  I was very quickly drawn to what I thought tasted better, seemed fresher from the vendors  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:49):**  at the farmers market in New York City.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:52):**  And over the course of several years, I started focusing on a more sustainable diet, healthy  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:02:58):**  food, supporting farmers, all the while I was working in the finance industry in New  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:03:03):**  York City.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:03:04):**  And a few years into that job, actually about six, seven years into that sort of career  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:03:10):**  path, I decided that that was not what I wanted to do long term, at least the finance application  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:03:16):**  that I was doing in investment banking and private equity.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:03:21):**  And I had become over that same time period, as I mentioned, really supportive of farmers  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:03:26):**  and the concept of growing healthy food really excited me.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:03:30):**  So I took an apprenticeship on a rooftop farm in New York City for a season and very quickly  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:03:37):**  realized that I was not going to be in production agriculture.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:03:41):**  That was not going to be my strong suit.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:03:43):**  While I was still very much drawn into the concept of business and finance, and I was  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:03:49):**  very fortunate to start working around that time during this transition period for Iroquois  
**[0:03:55-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:03:55):**  Valley Farms, which has a very unique connection in that it is supporting sustainable agriculture.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:04:03):**  And the methods that are doing it is using somewhat traditional finance concepts, although  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:04:09):**  the way we apply them are non-traditional.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:04:13):**  And supporting these farmers.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:04:14):**  So I sort of was able to combine my passion and interest for sustainable agriculture and  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:04:19):**  food with my experience and background in finance.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:04:24):**  In a nutshell, you've been around quite a bit, I think, I saw 2004, 2006 or something,  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:04:29):**  which has been a while.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:04:31):**  What is it currently doing?  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:04:33):**  What do people know it of?  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:04:34):**  And how do you help these organic family farmers to scale or to grow?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:04:39):**  So very simply, Iroquois Valley Farms is an organic farmland real estate investment trust.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:04:48):**  A real estate investment trust is just a fancy word for a special type of company that only  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:04:54):**  owns and manages real estate assets.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:04:58):**  So we specifically invest in organic farmland investments.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:05:03):**  The way we do that is a little bit different than what might be more traditional investing.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:05:09):**  Our focus very specifically is around supporting organic family farmers with land access.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:05:16):**  So the fact that we are buying and leasing land or providing mortgage financing to these  
**[0:05:21-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:05:21):**  organic farmers is more the method of our goal to help support the family farmers that  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:05:30):**  are doing things the right way grow their existing organic business.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:05:34):**  So we've raised private capital from over 300 investors in 10 plus years we've been  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:05:42):**  operating and we use that money to support these farmers, as I mentioned, by farmland  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:05:48):**  and give them long term leases.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:05:51):**  Or in the past couple of years, we started a mortgage financing program to support farmers  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:05:56):**  that aren't getting the right access to capital via traditional lenders.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:06:01):**  So basically, if I can summarize the two approaches, either you buy land close to or nearby successful  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:06:10):**  organic farmers and lease the land to them for a long term or you help them acquiring  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:06:17):**  that type of land for them as they are scaling up.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:06:20):**  Exactly.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:06:21):**  That's the exact model.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:06:22):**  The one important item to note is that we are not speculators in the sense that we see  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:06:29):**  a farm for sale and say, Oh, this would be great for an organic farmer.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:06:33):**  Our business model is built first for the farmer.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:06:37):**  So we like to say that we're farmer first in that we develop relationships with these  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:06:42):**  farmers prior to working with them.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:06:45):**  And the farmer brings us the opportunity.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:06:47):**  This way, we don't have to be knowledgeable about everything, agriculture in the United  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:06:54):**  States or everything organic agriculture in the United States.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:06:58):**  We want to work with existing farmers that are already talented and help them grow when  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:03):**  they need our assistance.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:06):**  So for instance, I'm running a farm in upstate New York.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:09):**  I get to know you guys.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:11):**  I'm interacting.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:12):**  And the moment I can see my neighbor wanting to retire or I see an opportunity in my area  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:19):**  that would work really well for my farm or my operation.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:22):**  That's the moment I get in touch with you more seriously.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:27):**  And we get to work basically to see if we can acquire the land and scale.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:31):**  Exactly you can acquire.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:32):**  I can acquire, you can acquire depending on the structure, but to scale my operation.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:38):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:39):**  And it's funny the example that you cited, we get that conversation all the time.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:45):**  Farmer calls us.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:46):**  Yeah, three of my neighbors are going to be retiring in the next three to five years.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:51):**  I just wanted to talk to you, learn about what you're doing.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:54):**  And then it might be another year and a half before the second conversation happens with  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:58):**  that farmer.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:07:59):**  Like, yeah, my neighbor told me that, you know, he or she is thinking about this being  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:04):**  their last season and looking to sell.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:06):**  And I'm sort of the first one in line that they'd like to sell to.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:10):**  So that's exactly, it's definitely a long lead time.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:14):**  A lot of these sales are private and localized and you wouldn't even know about them if you  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:18):**  didn't have that relationship with the farmer upfront.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:22):**  It's not that there's a public website or a public marketplace where you can find these  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:26):**  things.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:27):**  Exactly.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:28):**  And so this relationship, I mean, they're building over them.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:32):**  How much land have you helped acquire?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:34):**  Have you acquired?  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:35):**  How much money have you raised if that's public to have a sense of scale?  
**[0:08:39-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:40):**  So right now we're working with over 35 farm families.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:44):**  We've made over 50 farmland investments and that's covering about 10,000 acres.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:53):**  And right now the REIT is around $50 million in assets size, US dollars that is.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:08:59):**  And between brackets, just farmland.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:09:02):**  Are you interested or are you helping some of these farmers on the local processing side?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:09:08):**  On what, what, what, what should I envision there?  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:09:11):**  Is it mainly farmland access to farmland that you are helping to establish?  
**[0:09:16-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:09:16):**  Yeah, we, we are pretty much exclusively focused on helping with the land access piece.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:09:24):**  And that is intentionally by design.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:09:27):**  One, we don't want to be the smartest farmer in the room.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:09:33):**  We want to partner with the smartest farmer in the room.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:09:36):**  So we don't necessarily have all the agricultural knowledge that these farmers have that we're  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:09:41):**  working with.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:09:43):**  We work with mostly multi-generational farm families, meaning the farmer we're working  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:09:48):**  with, their parents were farmers, their grandparents were farmers, sometimes going back six plus  
**[0:09:53-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:09:53):**  generations.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:09:55):**  So on average, these farmers that we're working with have over a hundred plus years of ingrained  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:01):**  family farming experience through these multiple generations.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:05):**  They are smarter than we are going to be in production systems that work for the areas  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:12):**  they're going to be.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:13):**  And the systems that work in upstate New York are going to be different than the systems  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:17):**  that work in Montana and what works in north central Illinois.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:22):**  And the markets are different.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:23):**  So we can't be an expert on all places.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:25):**  What we can be an expert in is developing strong and healthy relationships with these  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:30):**  farm families and supporting them.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:33):**  And to ask an obvious question, but why would they come to you instead of a local bank?  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:38):**  Is that an issue at all for you in terms of competition basically as investors?  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:43):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:44):**  There's a lot of different ways that farmers can access capital and access land.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:52):**  The two differentiating factors for us on our buy and lease side of the business, which  
**[0:10:59-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:10:59):**  is about 70% of our assets, is that we are giving long-term leases to these farmers,  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:11:08):**  leases that they can count on.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:11:09):**  We are a landowner that wants to support their specific operation, not any operation.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:11:16):**  So while we are trying to do everything at a fair market value, we're also trying to  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:11:23):**  do it in a way that supports the existing farmer's business.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:11:27):**  A lot of leases in the United States are year-long leases where the farmer doesn't have security  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:11:34):**  to provide these long-term leases.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:11:37):**  They can invest in the soil.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:11:38):**  They can invest in getting that organic certification and know that they're going to reap the benefits  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:11:43):**  for a long term.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:11:45):**  A lot of times the farmers that we're working with have these long-standing relationships  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:11:53):**  with native landowners, but at some point those landowners need to sell.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:11:57):**  And then the next buyer may not be, they might be just interested in renting to the highest  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:12:05):**  bidder in terms of who's going to pay the most for rent and not necessarily developing  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:12:09):**  long-term relationships.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:12:11):**  So on the leasing side, it's the longer term security piece that we're offering.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:12:16):**  And on the mortgage financing side, the farmers are generally, it's a little bit different  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:12:24):**  in each geographies, but are not getting the same capital access opportunities that their  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:12:30):**  conventional neighbor might have.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:12:32):**  The agricultural banks for a variety of reasons look at organic farming as a risk factor.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:12:38):**  We look at it as a positive.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:12:40):**  We view it as a growth market, a more profitable market.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:12:44):**  Yes, there's a risk with organic transition, but once they get that organic certification,  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:12:50):**  it's actually de-risked in terms of their operations.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:12:54):**  So they're getting blocked out from some of the traditional lending opportunities.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:12:59):**  A lot of the regional banks are starting to remove their agricultural portfolio.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:13:05):**  Maybe their banker that covered the farmers has retired and they don't have anyone with  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:13:10):**  experience or they just want to reduce their exposure to that asset class because of whatever  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:13:17):**  cyclical activities are happening in the market.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:13:20):**  So we are seeing a lot of farmers actually not having good access to mortgage financing.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:13:28):**  And we view that as a role that we can play.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:13:32):**  And we launched that business a couple of years ago and it's grown from not having done  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:13:39):**  any mortgage financing to now being north of 20% of our asset base.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:13:45):**  Yeah, that's very impressive.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:13:46):**  And when you look at the land itself and the movements you see in beyond organic and regenerative  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:13:54):**  agriculture, building soil, etc, what do you see in that space?  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:13:58):**  You see a lot of new people moving in.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:14:01):**  What do you see in terms of the future of beyond organic as you can maybe qualify this  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:14:07):**  movement?  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:14:08):**  Yeah, so I mean that brings in a rabbit hole that one can go very deeply down, but what  
**[0:14:15-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:14:15):**  is sustainable agriculture?  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:14:18):**  Obviously the word sustainable is often greenwashed by a variety of companies.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:14:24):**  And our take right now is that organic is one of the most recognized production methods  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:14:36):**  that is a vast improvement over the conventional system.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:14:40):**  And the letter of the law of organic is a huge improvement over the chemical systems,  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:14:49):**  but isn't necessarily the optimal system.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:14:54):**  So we work with a variety of farmers that go well beyond what the letter of the law  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:14:59):**  for certified USDA organic is.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:15:03):**  And all of our farmers are focused on building soil health and improving the quality of the  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:15:11):**  microorganisms and macroorganisms in their soil, in the fields that they're working in.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:15:18):**  And that's what we're really looking for is someone that wants to improve agriculture  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:15:24):**  and what is the ultimate system and methodology that one should use.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:15:29):**  I think that's something that science is going to ultimately tease out in the next 20 to  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:15:35):**  30 years.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:15:36):**  But before we can jump to optimal sustainable agriculture, we got to move very quickly away  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:15:42):**  from the conventional system.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:15:44):**  And that's really what we're about and we're about supporting the shift from chemical to  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:15:49):**  organic.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:15:51):**  Once you go to organic, then there's going to be additional opportunities to go beyond  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:15:55):**  organic and to make more improvements on soil health and maximize soil health.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:02):**  And you see that happening with our farmers in that once they get their organic certification,  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:07):**  then the opportunities just continue to blossom because of the markets that become available,  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:13):**  because of their knowledge growing, because of getting exposure to other organic farmers  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:19):**  and learning about new systems.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:20):**  And so we want to see all of our farmers working on incremental improvements.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:27):**  And the interesting thing, if you go back to the organic movement from the beginning,  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:32):**  that's the basic principle of organic.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:34):**  It's not don't do this, don't do that.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:37):**  It's build your soil health, improve year by year.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:41):**  And we see that happening with all of our farmers.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:43):**  Very, very interesting.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:46):**  Let's switch sides to the investor part.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:49):**  How has been the response?  
**[0:16:51-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:51):**  What do you see over there?  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:52):**  I mean, 10 years is a nice amount of time.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:55):**  What do you have seen?  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:16:56):**  For instance, if we look a year ago till now, it's now September, 2018.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:17:01):**  Have you seen big changes?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:17:03):**  What has been the response so far from mainly accredited investors, if I understood correctly?  
**[0:17:09-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:17:09):**  What's interesting from my perspective is not a lot has changed in the last year, in  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:17:16):**  the sense that there's still a huge demand for healthy food.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:17:20):**  That growth for organic and sustainable food continues to outpace the growth of the regular  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:17:27):**  food market.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:17:29):**  So from the demand side, it's still growing just like it was.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:17:34):**  From the supply side, we're still seeing the same constraints holding back the growth of  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:17:40):**  organic production.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:17:43):**  And that's, you know, farmers not willing to change.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:17:46):**  That's the cost of transition being too burdensome to the farmers.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:17:52):**  It's the conventional systems having too much of a stranglehold on the existing agricultural  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:17:59):**  system that fights these changes.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:03):**  And so the reality is, you know, on the overall level, not much has changed.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:08):**  We as an organization, we've obviously continued to grow every year.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:12):**  We continue to raise more capital.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:15):**  Our business is atypical in terms of a private equity investment.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:20):**  We use an operating company approach.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:22):**  We don't guarantee that investors are going to get their money back in 10 years because  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:27):**  we're going to sell the asset.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:29):**  That's just never going to work for our farmers if we tell the farmers like, oh, yeah, we  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:33):**  want to work with you.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:34):**  But by the way, we're going to sell this farm in five to six years.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:38):**  And if you can't buy it, you know, that's just the way it's going to be.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:42):**  Our business is built on long term relationships with these farmers and we have to commit to  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:48):**  them to not sell the farm unless they want to buy it from us.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:53):**  And because of that, we can't give the investors a defined exit.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:18:59):**  That limited the number of investors that were willing to go into this sort of non-traditional  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:04):**  structure in the past.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:05):**  Fortunately, we're starting to see some of these bigger investors realize that if they  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:10):**  really want to have impact, if they really want to support the types of businesses that  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:15):**  they want to see, they're going to need to venture into these non-traditional investment  
**[0:19:20-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:20):**  structures.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:21):**  So we are seeing a lot more interest from folks that previously would have ruled us  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:26):**  out saying, no, you don't have a defined exit.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:29):**  We're not going to invest in you.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:31):**  So that's a very positive momentum on the impact investing side.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:34):**  Yeah, which is very interesting.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:36):**  It's something that has come back many, many times on this show, like the traditional,  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:43):**  just as the traditional way of agriculture is changing, has to change and needs to change  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:48):**  even faster.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:49):**  So the way of investing six year exit or fund structures of 10 plus two, when it comes to  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:19:57):**  building soil, when it comes to rebuilding a food system, simply don't fit or aren't  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:20:02):**  enough and slowly but surely, like, I mean, groups like you are putting out an example  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:20:08):**  of another way of another, another tool in the toolbox, but that needs to be met with  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:20:13):**  investors that are ready also to put that in somewhere in their portfolio and to see  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:20:18):**  that as a, as an interesting investment, maybe not the one they set out to do, but the reality  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:20:23):**  in agriculture is, is this in time is, is very different compared to a Silicon Valley  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:20:29):**  investment.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:20:31):**  Exactly.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:20:32):**  And let's touch upon the democratization piece.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:20:35):**  I've seen soil restoration notes, which were mostly for accredited investors.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:20:40):**  What has been your thinking on how to bring this to between bracket the masses and to  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:20:46):**  investors like me that would like to, who are not accredited or what's your, I've, again,  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:20:52):**  a theme that came back, comes back many, many times, not many in on the short list that  
**[0:20:57-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:20:57):**  I talked to many of the expiration to do it and really want to get to retail and get to  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:21:03):**  small scale, but, but it's been quite tricky except for some crowdfunding examples I've  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:21:08):**  seen.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:21:09):**  So what's your take on that?  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:21:10):**  Yeah, well, I don't want to go on a long diatribe about SCC rules, making my life very  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:21:16):**  difficult in terms of achieving the goals that we want to achieve about democratizing  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:21:21):**  impact investing.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:21:23):**  But to make a long story short, it's been very difficult to raise capital.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:21:31):**  Going out to the true retail investors and non accredited investors, investors that don't  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:21:37):**  have a net worth above a million dollars.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:21:40):**  Fortunately within the United States, the regulations have started to loosen a little  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:21:45):**  bit and there are some opportunities.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:21:48):**  We are looking to launch what is called a regulation, a offering, a specifically a tier  
**[0:21:55-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:21:55):**  two, also called a reg a plus offering that will allow us to accept basically all investors.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:22:03):**  The only limitation is the investor can invest more than 10% of their net worth or 10% of  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:22:10):**  their annual income into these types of offerings.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:22:14):**  So there is some limits on the amount that they can invest based on their particular  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:22:21):**  earnings and asset situation.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:22:24):**  But other than that, within the United States we can accept money from anyone.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:22:29):**  We are working right now on putting that together.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:22:33):**  It has been a long, slow process.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:22:35):**  It is something that we have wanted to do for the past few years, but there's a huge  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:22:43):**  cost associated with doing so.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:22:45):**  So we needed to have the right size and scale.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:22:47):**  We needed to have more of our ducks in a row in terms of compliance activities relating  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:22:54):**  to audits and being capable of meeting other reporting thresholds that are going to be  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:22:59):**  required of us.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:23:01):**  So the burden on our administration side is going to be much higher.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:23:05):**  We needed to make sure we are capable of doing that.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:23:08):**  All of these reasons have slowed us down from when we would have liked to do this to now.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:23:14):**  Our goal is to launch this offering this year, later this year, and start accepting non-accredited  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:23:22):**  investors.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:23:23):**  We feel very strongly that our investment is appropriate for nearly everyone, and we  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:23:30):**  want to have an offering that allows us to accept anyone that views this as appropriate  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:23:36):**  for them.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:23:38):**  We fortunately are dealing with a real asset, an asset that has a stable valuation.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:23:43):**  It doesn't fluctuate tremendously due to market changes.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:23:48):**  It is actually not correlated to the overall marketplace.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:23:52):**  For that reason, it is a safe and sound investment.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:23:56):**  For these smaller investors, the more investors we have, the easier we can provide liquidity  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:01):**  for those smaller investors if anything happens.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:05):**  That's obviously one of the biggest concerns of the SEC is that the smaller investor gets  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:09):**  trapped and isn't able to get their money when they need to.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:13):**  We're very fortunate to have a wide investor base and can use that wide investor base to  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:18):**  help take out these smaller investors if and when they need liquidity.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:23):**  Yeah, extremely interesting.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:26):**  Without going too much into details, what would that mean for me?  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:29):**  Could I put, what's the minimum?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:31):**  Is it $1,000 if you already know, and what kind of term am I looking at?  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:37):**  Is it 10 years and dividends?  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:40):**  What kind of structure should I think of if you can already share that?  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:44):**  Obviously, we don't want to go across any lines, but what's the thinking there?  
**[0:24:47-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:47):**  Yeah, so we are looking at a $10,000 minimum.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:55):**  And the reason for that is there's a limit on the number of investors that we can accept  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:24:59):**  before we have additional compliance reporting thresholds.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:25:03):**  And once we decide to cross that, we can lower the amount.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:25:08):**  But for now, we're trying to make sure that we don't cross those thresholds yet.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:25:13):**  There still is a lot of administration per investor, and we need to figure out how to  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:25:18):**  reduce those onboarding transaction costs.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:25:22):**  The investment is going to be the same as the investment that people can make right  
**[0:25:27-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:25:27):**  now.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:25:28):**  You're going to see equity shares in the real estate investment trust.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:25:32):**  So you as the investor would buy a share of the company, and that company has the diversified  
**[0:25:38-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:25:38):**  portfolio investment.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:25:40):**  So you actually buy the same asset that everyone else already owns, which is great.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:25:45):**  You get that instant diversification with your share, that existing portfolio that's  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:25:51):**  generating revenue.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:25:53):**  Long term, you would expect dividends in the 2% to 3% per year.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:25:59):**  Right now, we're at about 1%, so we need to continue to grow and leverage some fixed costs  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:26:03):**  to hit that sort of target, 2% to 3%.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:26:07):**  And you would also expect annual appreciation on the value of the stock.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:26:13):**  In terms of liquidity, it is going to be the same structure that we have right now, seven  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:26:19):**  years before you can sell back to the company.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:26:23):**  With the big asterisk that anyone who's ever asked for their money back, we paid them out  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:26:30):**  at whole current value without sort of dinging them on anything.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:26:34):**  So we don't want to have investors that don't want to be invested.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:26:40):**  We're fortunate that we have the capital, that we have a growing investor base.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:26:43):**  We can take out those investors that want out.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:26:46):**  We don't want investors coming in thinking that they're only going to be invested for  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:26:50):**  a year or two.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:26:51):**  We want them thinking about seven plus years.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:26:53):**  But at the same time, we realize life circumstances change and want to be amenable.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:26:58):**  So anyone who's ever asked for their money back, we've given it to them at the current  
**[0:27:03-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:03):**  valuation.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:05):**  Every single redemption that we've had to date, the investor has made money and has  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:09):**  made a profit on their investment over time.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:11):**  So we have the track record.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:14):**  We just can't 100% commit to anything other than the seven years at this time.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:19):**  No, of course.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:21):**  You cannot guarantee that as you'd never know the amount of people that could ask in January  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:26):**  2019 suddenly, or I mean, that's fair enough.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:31):**  And if you look at, let's imagine there's a theater full of smart impact investors listening  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:37):**  to this podcast and they are interested in soil.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:41):**  They read the books.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:42):**  They see this generation problem as well.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:46):**  They see that the organic farmers need to scale a lot of land comes on the market.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:50):**  What would be your advice, obviously without giving investment advice, but what would be  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:54):**  your advice to where to start if you're not in agriculture or food, but you would like  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:27:59):**  to get started on that.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:28:01):**  You would like to move some of your portfolio or a big chunk of your portfolio in that space.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:28:06):**  Where would you reckon both maybe let's look at the US as you know that the market probably  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:28:11):**  a bit better.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:28:12):**  What would be a direction to take?  
**[0:28:14-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:28:14):**  Well, obviously sitting, you know, working for a company that is supporting the farmers  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:28:22):**  and supporting the systems directly in the soil.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:28:27):**  I would say start, start with the soil.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:28:31):**  And there's some asterisks there, but you, you do see the biggest problem for farmers,  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:28:40):**  especially young farmers is access to land and access to capital.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:28:46):**  And those sort of go hand in hand.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:28:49):**  I think if we can figure out ways to be creative and support farmers with land security, you're  
**[0:28:57-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:28:57):**  going to see an increase in the production of sustainable food.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:29:04):**  That's going to drive sort of the next layers, the processing, the consumer demand is there.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:29:09):**  I don't think you need to, you know, invest in ways to increase the consumer demand.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:29:14):**  I'm not sure what that would even look like, but the demand is there.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:29:20):**  The supply is not there, at least domestically in the United States to meet the demand.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:29:25):**  So if we can figure out how to increase the supply, the systems and the money will flow  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:29:32):**  into the systems that follow, I personally believe.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:29:34):**  So I think starting with something like Iroquois Valley Farms, or depending on your financial  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:29:41):**  situation, maybe you can be more direct in supporting land access.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:29:47):**  But something that meets the farmers where they need it most and meets them in a way  
**[0:29:51-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:29:51):**  that works for their business systems is essential if you want to see this grow.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:29:59):**  There are a lot of landowners that I've come across that are very supportive of sustainable  
**[0:30:05-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:30:05):**  agriculture and they rent land to farmers for arguably below value because they want  
**[0:30:14-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:30:14):**  to see that farmer have a low cost, but they're not willing to guarantee them access.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:30:21):**  And without that guarantee, the farmer can't develop the infrastructure and they can't  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:30:26):**  invest the same way if they had that long term security.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:30:29):**  So not only do you need that creative capital in terms of maybe willing to be an impact  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:30:35):**  investment, you also need it to be willing to make commitments long term.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:30:40):**  Yeah, it's interesting how time comes back in this discussion because why would you as  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:30:47):**  a good soil building farmer try to build soil if you only have a one or two year contract?  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:30:53):**  I mean, from an asset point of view, why are you building up their asset basically, the  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:30:58):**  soil, if you can be kicked off between brackets a year from now?  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:31:03):**  Exactly.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:31:04):**  And the farmers do it because that's what they believe, but they'd probably be able  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:31:09):**  to do it better if they had more security.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:31:13):**  They'd also be able to invest in things that have a longer lead time in terms of paying  
**[0:31:19-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:31:19):**  off, especially for soil building, bringing animals into the systems and working rotations.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:31:26):**  And to do that, fencing is needed and potentially to increase yields, irrigation is needed,  
**[0:31:33-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:31:33):**  a fishing gear.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:31:34):**  And so there's a variety of infrastructure type things that both are beneficial to the  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:31:40):**  soil and beneficial to the farmer's bottom line and diversification that need that long  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:31:46):**  term commitment.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:31:48):**  Let alone if you start speaking about trees, et cetera, which I mean, many are completely  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:31:53):**  out of the 10 year are extremely interesting for soil and farmers.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:31:57):**  But yeah, you need the lead time to get to 10 or sometimes 12 years before they are productive.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:32:03):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:32:04):**  Which basically that's the reason why you don't see many trees on farming.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:32:08):**  I definitely think that, you know, more incorporation of permaculture systems needs to be brought  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:32:15):**  in and there's also a learning factor on that as well, because there's not as many systems  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:32:20):**  in place, the farmers aren't educated on how to use them.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:32:24):**  So there's a training aspect needed on that side as well, which goes a little bit beyond  
**[0:32:28-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:32:28):**  the impact investing needs.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:32:31):**  And if you look at the market on a farmer level, are there enough?  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:32:36):**  Do you see enough good capable?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:32:38):**  I mean, they need to be trained obviously, but soil building farmers that is, if we would  
**[0:32:45-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:32:45):**  really increase the amount of capital organizations like you are managing and does much more land.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:32:52):**  Are there enough good farmers to, to, to farm the land and build up the soil?  
**[0:32:58-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:32:58):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:32:59):**  Uh, you know, we personally are inundated with requests from, from farmers.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:05):**  We cannot fulfill sort of the pipeline of farmers that come to us, uh, you know, and  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:11):**  knock on wood.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:12):**  That's good.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:13):**  We can pick the cream of the crop, so to speak, and work with the best farmers.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:20):**  We don't even advertise in terms of trying to find new farmers.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:26):**  Farmers come to us mostly through word of mouth.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:29):**  We do go to a couple of agricultural conferences a year and we'll meet some, some new farmers  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:34):**  that way.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:35):**  Uh, but if we had twice as much capital or three times as much capital, we'd still be  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:41):**  able to deploy it in a reasonable amount of time.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:44):**  There's plenty of farmers out there that, that need this.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:47):**  There are plenty of talented farmers around and it's just needed that the capital needs  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:54):**  to be there.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:55):**  The systems need to be there.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:33:57):**  And that all, that all starts with the land security piece in my mind.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:34:02):**  And is that your, like, let's say we, we talk in a year from now, September, 2019, I mean,  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:34:08):**  obviously you want to launch this year, the democratization piece.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:34:13):**  Um, will you be mostly focused on the fundraising part as, as that seems to be, but correct  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:34:18):**  me if I'm wrong, the big bottleneck so far, the biggest leverage point.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:34:23):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:34:24):**  You know, in the next year, I sort of hope that we haven't changed too much.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:34:29):**  I hope that we're a larger company that we've, you know, provided access to a wider base  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:34:36):**  of investors.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:34:37):**  Uh, what we need to do personally is become more efficient and continue to grow and scale  
**[0:34:45-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:34:45):**  and leverage our existing resources.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:34:47):**  Uh, but we are never going to get that big VC type money because we're not dealing with  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:34:53):**  a company that has exponential growth opportunities.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:34:56):**  We're, we're in the soil working with the farmers one farm at a time, and that is a  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:35:04):**  slow growth, uh, business and takes time to build.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:35:09):**  And we, I just hope a year from now that we've stayed our course and are true to ourselves  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:35:13):**  and are still working with the same great farmers and, you know, have more investors  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:35:18):**  and we're always going to need to continue to grow and operate more efficiently and make  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:35:25):**  sure that the investors are getting the liquidity that they need, getting the dividend that  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:35:30):**  is attractive to them, but in a way that still is working appropriately for our farmers.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:35:36):**  And just very briefly on exponential growth, do you see exponential growth in terms of  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:35:42):**  learnings of a farmer, like when they, he or she, or as a couple or as a family go to  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:35:48):**  organic and then beyond, is there a speed up?  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:35:51):**  I've seen it sometimes that some people get really into it and you can see almost that  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:35:56):**  the soil, the carbon level in the soil follows the same, like as it gets over a certain threshold,  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:36:01):**  like the systems just began to turn faster as the farmer learns and learns and approves  
**[0:36:07-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:36:07):**  and of course adjusts a lot.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:36:09):**  Do you see that a lot happening, like people get, get into it more and that there is a  
**[0:36:14-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:36:14):**  nonlinear path there?  
**[0:36:17-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:36:17):**  Definitely in the early years, absolutely.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:36:19):**  I think that there is, when a farmer makes that commitment to organic and maybe they've  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:36:25):**  been farming conventionally in the past, it's drinking from the fire hose is probably the  
**[0:36:31-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:36:31):**  best analogy, just like anything else.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:36:33):**  And there's so much to learn, so much to do.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:36:38):**  And the deeper you dive, you realize the more you can go into the science and technical  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:36:43):**  aspects and you see some of our farmers digging very deeply into that stuff.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:36:49):**  You see a lot of our farmers taking it from a higher level perspective, coming up with  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:36:55):**  systems and rotations that work for their geographies and their markets.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:37:00):**  I think you start to see some plateauing once you've gotten through those first probably  
**[0:37:09-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:37:09):**  five to 10 years of experience.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:37:11):**  But even after that, there's still continual learning.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:37:14):**  You know, I sort of talked earlier about optimal soil health and I don't know if there is such  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:37:22):**  a thing, but there always is opportunities to improve and all our farmers are looking  
**[0:37:28-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:37:28):**  for those.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:37:29):**  And those are not only going to develop by better science and understanding, they're  
**[0:37:33-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:37:33):**  going to develop by markets and access and equipment and other techniques that are more  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:37:43):**  than just understanding the soil biology.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:37:47):**  And how are you facilitating those lessons learned, the sharing between the farmers?  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:37:53):**  Because all these pioneers, even though they might operate in slightly different geographies  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:37:58):**  and does different rotation systems and obviously different markets, there seems to be a big  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:38:03):**  role for an organization like yourself to really make sure that they get access to this  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:38:09):**  maybe a bit underground knowledge that they won't find at their neighbors.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:38:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:38:15):**  We're very fortunate that the farmers communicate a lot amongst their networks.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:38:21):**  You know, one of our big items when we are reviewing a farmer and their operation is  
**[0:38:28-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:38:28):**  understanding who they're learning from and how they're learning.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:38:32):**  So we want to work with someone that is applying this concept of continuous improvement and  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:38:39):**  continuing to learn.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:38:40):**  So they generally already have their existing networks.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:38:43):**  With that being said, we share information between our farmers when it might be relevant.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:38:49):**  We are very supportive of our farmers going to organic farming conferences.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:38:55):**  You know, there's a whole host of great farming conferences across the United States.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:39:00):**  And in the past, we've actually paid for them their attendance to those so that they have  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:39:05):**  access to more of those farmers and have the opportunity to continually learn.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:39:11):**  I don't think as I mentioned, we are going to be those in-house resident experts, but  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:39:17):**  we can be a conduit for giving them access to those experts and encouraging that and  
**[0:39:22-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:39:22):**  making it affordable.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:39:24):**  And you know, that accrues to everyone's benefit.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:39:28):**  It's beneficial for the planet because their operations improve.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:39:31):**  It's beneficial to our investors bottom line because they potentially become more profitable  
**[0:39:38-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:39:38):**  by becoming more efficient and needing less inputs and becoming more holistic.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:39:44):**  So it really is a win-win to support those types of conferences and learnings.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:39:51):**  And you know, we have sponsored those conferences in the past.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:39:55):**  We want to make sure that our farmers continually to be engaged and that's economically feasible  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:40:03):**  for them.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:40:04):**  So that's really the biggest role that we can help in continuing to help them develop  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:40:09):**  and grow their knowledge base.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:40:13):**  And in terms of impact investing, it's always a big topic.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:40:17):**  Measurements.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:40:18):**  What are you measuring when it comes to sustainable agriculture?  
**[0:40:22-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:40:22):**  Yeah, that's a great question because there's so much one could measure and there's a cost  
**[0:40:30-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:40:30):**  for measurement, which is always tough.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:40:32):**  Right now we are developing a soil measurement protocol and we are going to focus on one  
**[0:40:41-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:40:41):**  of the big biological markers that is not, you know, the end all be all in terms of soil  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:40:48):**  health, but is probably what we think as one of the biggest indicators of soil health and  
**[0:40:53-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:40:53):**  that's organic matter.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:40:55):**  So we are in the process of working with a third party to develop this soil measurement  
**[0:41:02-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:41:02):**  protocol, which will look at organic matter over time.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:41:05):**  And we've worked with a few farmers that have already been doing this and shown that they  
**[0:41:11-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:41:11):**  can take farms with very low organic matter, you know, 1% and over a reasonable time period  
**[0:41:18-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:41:18):**  develop that to 5 and 6%.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:41:22):**  And we want to see that over time with the farms that we're working with and the farmers  
**[0:41:26-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:41:26):**  businesses.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:41:28):**  And so that is our focus right now in terms of direct soil health measurements.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:41:36):**  And I'm sure as science evolves and as testing becomes more reasonable, we can look and add  
**[0:41:42-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:41:42):**  on top of that.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:41:44):**  And beyond the soil health, obviously we look at the number of acres that are under organic  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:41:51):**  management, the number of acres that we are bringing from conventional to organic, the  
**[0:41:55-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:41:55):**  number of farm families that we are supporting.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:41:58):**  Those are all important metrics for our business because we're about supporting these organic  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:42:04):**  farm families and increasing the number of acres in organic production.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:42:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:42:10):**  That seems to make a lot of sense.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:42:12):**  And maybe also the answer to the plateauing of at some point a field reaches, like it's  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:42:19):**  sort of not optimum, but in that system, the maximum soil organic matter, but then maybe  
**[0:42:24-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:42:24):**  the farmer gets restless or their neighbor wants to retire and they knock on your door  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:42:29):**  to acquire the next field of one or even less percent organic matter that they can get their  
**[0:42:34-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:42:34):**  hands dirty again to see even if they can get it even faster up to six or seven.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:42:40):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:42:42):**  And just as a final question, I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:42:45):**  We're almost on top of the hour.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:42:46):**  If you could wave your magic wand in the industry, not necessarily for the company itself, what  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:42:53):**  would you change to make regenerative agriculture and actually regenerative food as well more  
**[0:42:59-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:42:59):**  accessible, more mainstream?  
**[0:43:01-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:43:01):**  What would be the one thing, one barrier that you would take away with your magic wand?  
**[0:43:06-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:43:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:43:07):**  That's a, that's a really interesting question.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:43:10):**  And from my perspective, unfortunately there's no silver bullet, right?  
**[0:43:15-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:43:15):**  There is a whole host of issues that need to be addressed within the agricultural system.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:43:22):**  What I personally think would have the most benefit sort of improving the agricultural  
**[0:43:30-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:43:30):**  landscape would be removing the systems that encourage and allow for confined feeding operations.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:43:41):**  I think if you can bring animals back into the farm,  
**[0:43:45-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:43:45):**  Just to be clear, CAFOs, factory farms.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:43:48):**  Exactly.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:43:49):**  Bring the animals back onto the farm, eating their natural diet, especially the animals  
**[0:43:55-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:43:55):**  that are grazers.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:43:57):**  That is going to do wonders for a whole host of environmental problems caused by factory  
**[0:44:03-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:44:03):**  farms.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:44:04):**  It's going to force farmers to bring animals back into the land, which is better for the  
**[0:44:11-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:44:11):**  soil management.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:44:13):**  It's going to provide farmers opportunities to diversify.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:44:16):**  It's going to create food that is more healthy for humans.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:44:22):**  I mean, there's tons of studies that show the, you know, especially on milk specifically  
**[0:44:27-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:44:27):**  that show the increase in nutrient content of pasture raised milk versus industrial sort  
**[0:44:36-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:44:36):**  of milk operations where they're just tied up all day.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:44:39):**  And that's the same for pasture raised meat.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:44:42):**  I don't think you're going to change the consumer's behavior in terms of how much meat they want.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:44:48):**  I think that trend is going to continue to be there.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:44:50):**  I also think that there's production systems that's essential to have animals on the land.  
**[0:44:57-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:44:57):**  So I don't want to change that system.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:44:59):**  But if you can improve the way meat is raised, there's going to be a whole host of benefits  
**[0:45:04-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:04):**  both environmentally and socially because you're feeding the population with better  
**[0:45:11-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:11):**  quality meat.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:13):**  And so that would probably be the biggest thing that I would like to see changed in  
**[0:45:18-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:18):**  the system.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:19):**  And that's going to do, you know, would make a huge dent, but there's still tons of other  
**[0:45:23-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:23):**  work that would need to be done.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:25):**  Yeah, obviously.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:26):**  And with that, I would like to thank you, Kevin, for your time this morning.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:30):**  And I'll definitely be checking in how the democratization piece is going, the fundraising  
**[0:45:36-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:36):**  in general, and of course, the allocation, soil management or measurement levels.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:41):**  It all sounds extremely necessary and interesting.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:45):**  Thank you so much.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:46):**  You're welcome.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:47):**  Thanks for having me, Colin.

**[0:45:58-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:45:58):**  towards organic and beyond organic and into longer term hands, farmhands actually, while  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:46:04):**  helping the next generation of family farmers grow.

**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:47:05):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:47:10):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:47:14):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:47:15):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question,  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:47:19):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:47:24):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:49:25-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:49:25):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:49:28):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:49:30):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/10/05/kevin-egolf/#t=0:49:33):**  It's also not investment advice.

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:00:14):**  Checking in with Gijs of Groundrud on how they're fair and transparent wholesale regenerative  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:00:18):**  ingredient businesses doing and why Gijs is more optimistic about the possibilities of  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:00:23):**  building successful and profitable businesses based on regenerative agriculture practices  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:00:27):**  and why the focus on quality, taste and transparency of smaller food brands is creating the demand  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:00:33):**  to make a significant change on the ground.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:00:35):**  Not all roses and sunshine.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:00:37):**  We obviously also get into why even with all this experience and significant track record,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:00:42):**  it is difficult to raise capital for regen agroecology businesses in the global south.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:00:48):**  This is the investing in regenerative agriculture and food podcast investing as if the planet  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:00:56):**  mattered where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:01:01):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:01:06):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:01:11):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:01:14):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:01:17):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:01:22):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:01:26):**  attention to the dirt soil underneath our feet to make it easy for fans to support our  
**[0:01:31-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:01:31):**  work.

**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:01:55):**  Welcome to another episode.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:01:57):**  Today we have Gijs Boers.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:01:58):**  Welcome back on the podcast to talk about Grounded and everything that happened since  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:02):**  March last year, March, 2021.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:05):**  And when we last talked and in the life of a startup and a scale up, a lot of things  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:08):**  are happening in such a short period or such a long period actually.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:12):**  So I'm very happy to have Gijs back.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:13):**  Welcome Gijs.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:14):**  Thanks Gunen and great to be back again.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:19):**  So obviously I will put the previous interviews.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:22):**  I think we called it the good, the bad and ugly of regen ag in the links below and also  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:26):**  an interview we did, I think three, four, maybe five years ago even.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:29):**  But just to, for everybody to refresh our memories, what is Grounded and what is Grounded  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:35):**  now?  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:36):**  Let's say we're talking at the end of April in 2022.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:39):**  How would you describe Grounded for somebody that has never heard about it?  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:42):**  Yeah, I think the common line over the past, almost a small decade has been, we want to  
**[0:02:49-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:49):**  scale regenerative agriculture in Africa and increase the income of farmers.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:02:56):**  We started off with doing some business development around landscape restoration.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:03:01):**  I think for most of you aware that agriculture is the biggest threat to healthy landscapes.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:03:08):**  We entered into regenerative agriculture and try to get a transition towards regen agri  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:03:16):**  up in Africa.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:03:17):**  Yeah, and we found the big hurdles and challenges.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:03:22):**  So eventually we ended up with a standing up and processing company that together with  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:03:28):**  a group of farmers to buy produce from farmers, process it and sell it.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:03:34):**  And through that company offer a lot of support to the farmers in that transition.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:03:38):**  That is still the common thread of Grounded.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:03:42):**  Still we're taking active positions in the value chain.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:03:45):**  But how we do that in more detail that has changed a lot over time.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:03:52):**  I think through many hurdles, mistakes and hard work and perseverance, we manage step  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:03:59):**  by step to make the model more perfect.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:04:06):**  And I think like a regenerative system, it's a step by step, but the nice thing is once  
**[0:04:12-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:04:12):**  you're on the road and you start picking up pace, slowly but surely you're getting there.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:04:20):**  And as you're so deep into the space, has something changed fundamentally?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:04:27):**  You see in the sector conversations you had over the last year, like the last 12 months.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:04:33):**  I see definitely an uptick on the podcast, a different uptick in my email box of people  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:04:38):**  wanting information, connections, introductions.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:04:41):**  And if you want to please all listeners reach out.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:04:43):**  I cannot promise I answer in a few days because the flow is getting quite strong.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:04:48):**  But I see a change in the last 18 months, in the last year as well.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:04:52):**  There seems to be more happening or at least our bubble is growing.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:04:55):**  Do you feel the same or how is that in, let's say the region movement in Africa, in Southern  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:01):**  Africa or the agriculture movement?  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:04):**  Obviously there's a bigger umbrella there.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:05):**  What do you feel there on the ground?  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:07):**  Has something been changing there as well or is it the same old, same old?  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:11):**  It's still very much neglected or at least from, let's say abroad.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:15):**  Yeah, there's always multiple answers to such a question, but it's definitely the case that  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:23):**  when we started, you know, region, if you would Google region of agriculture, there  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:27):**  were a couple thousand hits.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:31):**  And you know, when we started Grounded and we first started to look into regenerative  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:37):**  agriculture, we constantly had to explain what regenerative agriculture was and every  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:41):**  conversation you started.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:43):**  And after a couple of years, you would run into more people say, yeah, we know regenerative  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:48):**  agriculture, we do agroforestry, we've been in touch with it.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:52):**  And now I almost never explain anymore in most of the conversation what region agri  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:57):**  is.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:05:58):**  And then from time to time, you get these people to say regenerative agriculture, is  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:06:01):**  that like sustainable agriculture?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:06:03):**  And then you say, okay.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:06:04):**  And I think that's, that's, that explains how well you're doing your job, Koon, with  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:06:10):**  Spreading the Word because we are B2B in the background.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:06:15):**  And although we've picked up communication a lot over the past two years, but I think  
**[0:06:21-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:06:21):**  a big kudos to you for Spreading the Word and making it more familiar and bringing people  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:06:29):**  more up to speed on the potential.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:06:33):**  The potential and the challenges.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:06:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:06:35):**  And you do the potential and we explain the challenges and to make sure that people, our  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:06:42):**  communication focuses on the challenges and the hurdles that we've overcome.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:06:47):**  Yeah, and to make sure that people don't lose faith in that transition, because I think  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:06:56):**  that's one of the key things in our communication, normally that it's not easy to get there.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:01):**  But there are ways to get it, there are quick wins.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:05):**  And yeah, it's just sometimes sad to see some people giving up.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:13):**  What do you tell yourself or what do you tell them to not give up, like people in any transition,  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:21):**  it's often the darkest just before the light or it's like, it's really, it can be really  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:25):**  tough, especially the first years, of course, depending on the soil, the landscape, the  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:29):**  company.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:30):**  But it is definitely a very rough journey in many, many cases, yet to hear a story where  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:35):**  somebody said, Oh, it was so easy, just to switch from a heavily input dependent form  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:41):**  of agriculture to something that's much more knowledge intensive, much more interesting,  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:46):**  but much more complex as well.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:47):**  Like, what do you like internally?  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:49):**  How do you because you're running different companies, you're part of different, like  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:53):**  there are different levels, let's say, or different parts of their journey or different  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:57):**  pieces.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:07:58):**  How do you make sure you keep going?  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:08:00):**  Is it because you've seen some successes?  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:08:02):**  Okay, we know at some point, we'll figure out a recipe that works.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:08:05):**  Let's just keep going, keep trying?  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:08:07):**  Or how do you keep morale up when you're when you're in those dark moments where where stuff  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:08:11):**  dies and things don't grow or things grow too fast, which means you have weeds everywhere?  
**[0:08:16-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:08:16):**  Yeah, to give a practical example, I think in Zambia, a couple of years, we run a training  
**[0:08:24-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:08:24):**  scheme with hundreds and eventually small up in 1000s of farmers.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:08:32):**  And I think if you look over the entire program, the total results were not significant enough.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:08:40):**  But if we looked at the top 10% performance, performance in that program, and you show  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:08:46):**  see the results, and you see the quick wins that can be gained.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:08:50):**  And by looking at okay, what makes these farmers successful?  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:08:53):**  What other hurdles do other farmers have?  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:08:57):**  And you try to hold on not to the total success or the bottom line success as a company in  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:02):**  those early years, but I think you look a lot at the quick wins and to see what works  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:06):**  and where it works.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:09):**  And have a strong belief.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:11):**  We all know that we have to find different ways.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:15):**  And yeah, if you focus on the wins, and there's a you have an amazing team, and we have so  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:22):**  many people in the team that all feel okay, we have to do it differently.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:26):**  It's not gonna be easy.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:29):**  But we just keep going.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:30):**  And yeah, then you motivate each other.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:33):**  And based on the first results that you see with some of the farms that do pick it up  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:38):**  and that that do make it into a success.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:42):**  Yeah, that's, that was just enough spark to keep us going.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:47):**  But I think sometimes looking back, I think our biggest, our biggest strength was our  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:53):**  perseverance now.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:09:58):**  And just in Zambia, just to reiterate what what, what is the current status of that project  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:10:04):**  in that company?  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:10:05):**  What did you after a number of years of let's say, trial and error and R&D?  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:10:09):**  What have you found there that is working?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:10:14):**  Yeah, in the details, Zambia is also a larger country with quite some significant differences  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:10:21):**  in climate zone.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:10:22):**  The area we operated in the southern part closer to Namibia was a lot drier.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:10:29):**  We've seen that for a lot of farmers, they grew a bit of crops, more of an insurance  
**[0:10:36-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:10:36):**  on the side, but weren't really seeing farming as a business or really doing farmers more  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:10:44):**  farming more commercially.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:10:47):**  And some of the younger generations that would stay in that area, they try to do it.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:10:53):**  And what we've done is we've been now trying to invest more heavily in those top performers  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:11:01):**  and also aggregate them a bit.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:11:03):**  So we try to, we've picked a location with a lot of good farmers in the neighborhood  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:11:08):**  and try to centralize a bit of irrigation, compost making.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:11:13):**  So these family farms still have their own family farm, but one of the family members  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:11:18):**  or some family members come to more of a centralized farming location there where there's more  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:11:23):**  affordable irrigation because it's more economies of scale.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:11:27):**  But where we super intense region farming model, I would say with agroforestry lanes,  
**[0:11:33-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:11:33):**  high diversity, focused on high value crops and I mean vegetables, crops that require  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:11:42):**  a lot of labor, but we combine that with a very strong management team, a very large  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:11:48):**  amount of knowledge, research, data gathering.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:11:52):**  And then there's also, for example, there's a tractor that these families share.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:11:58):**  So the best farmers now not only use the half of their time to making paths and rows that  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:12:04):**  work is being done, but they focus on managing the crops and disease monitoring, making high  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:12:09):**  quality.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:12:10):**  So for them to bring that back to their family farm to spread it or to expand this, let's  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:12:16):**  say high intensive optimized farm combination.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:12:20):**  Yeah, it's a combination of both.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:12:23):**  So you want to, yeah, we want to scale both.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:12:26):**  I think that's a relatively well developed world.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:12:31):**  We have to have an anchor base and from there work with farmers in the neighborhood.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:12:37):**  And there, yeah, actually production is commenced and it's actually going really well.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:12:43):**  So that's the crops look good, the soils respond very well.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:12:51):**  And the farmers respond very well.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:12:53):**  So that's a good start.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:12:54):**  And another, yeah, we've chosen location because of new connection to Botswana was opening  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:12:59):**  up.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:00):**  There's a new border post open, a new bridge.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:03):**  We're tracking prices of the informal market.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:05):**  I'm fascinated by these informal markets, the inefficiencies, but also the efficiencies  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:10):**  to trust it's that's for a different podcast, but we tracking prices throughout Zambia.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:17):**  And we now add to location where prices are higher since that opening of the bridge and  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:22):**  since that connection opening up again.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:24):**  So it's yeah, after all those years and going from challenge to challenge, you're now in  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:30):**  a position where and we see that over a cross grounded that we're getting more and more  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:36):**  into petitions where things are actually going better than expected.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:39):**  And this is a lot of momentum.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:41):**  So that's amazing.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:42):**  That's been a while.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:44):**  And then now what's your position now?  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:45):**  What's your relationship with that company in Zambia?  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:48):**  Are you still very, very much involved or you mentioned management team or are you also,  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:52):**  I would say on your way out because it is going or what's your, what your connection  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:13:58):**  still with, with this is maybe, maybe to talk about the relation between grounded and, and,  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:05):**  and these companies in our portfolio, we refer to them as operating companies.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:08):**  In the beginning, we were very much involved.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:11):**  We were small teams and also on the ground, we didn't have a lot of resources that has  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:17):**  changed.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:18):**  It was a big step for grounded.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:20):**  In Zambia, we, we build a much stronger teams on the ground and much more staking on.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:25):**  Whereas we as grounded take more of a, we support finance for these of course we work  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:30):**  a bit on strategy.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:34):**  If they export, we work, we obviously support on that.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:37):**  We support on the legal side, but much more of the operations happens on the ground, much  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:41):**  more of the decisions, what they produce, how they produce it.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:45):**  It's supported by our region, every team.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:47):**  And one of the biggest transitions we have made is that we've used, we're using our experience  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:53):**  of building these companies from scratch.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:14:57):**  And we now working more and more with existing entrepreneurs that are in the early stage.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:15:02):**  And I think that's one of the biggest transitions that we've made over the past is we said to  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:15:08):**  yourself, okay, how can we, how can we scale and how can we optimize the lessons and our  
**[0:15:14-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:15:14):**  failures that we've made in the past?  
**[0:15:16-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:15:16):**  And yeah, when, when looking for new opportunities we came in touch with, with, with other entrepreneurs  
**[0:15:25-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:15:25):**  and there was an amazing click mainly because we all, we, we shared a lot of, we have a  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:15:32):**  lot of shared mistakes and a lot of shared challenges.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:15:35):**  And so you find each other in the, in, in the suffering or in the, in the obstacles  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:15:41):**  you have, or let's say, let's frame it differently in the recipe seeking of what works in this  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:15:46):**  context.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:15:47):**  And of course you, you have a million stories about that and they have those as well.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:15:52):**  So do you have an example of like in these journeys, you, you now actually are sort of  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:15:56):**  switching from setting these operating companies up from scratch by grounded to partnering  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:02):**  with already existing in many cases, small, but still existing company.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:06):**  There's already something there.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:07):**  There is an entrepreneur, there's a team, there's stuff being produced, being sold,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:11):**  being lost in some cases.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:13):**  And you partner with them to say, okay, how do we, how do we bring this to the next regenerative  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:18):**  level or the next business level as well?  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:20):**  Like how does that process work?  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:21):**  You meet them at a fair, you meet them at, at, at like trips.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:26):**  How do you find these, these how do you say diamonds in the rough, in the rough, I think  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:31):**  is the, is the term.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:32):**  How do you find them when they're not so shiny yet?  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:34):**  Yeah, via several channels.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:38):**  I think if you work in in an African continent for 10 years you, you always have a network,  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:46):**  but also on trade first, literally you see company supply and produce from Africa.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:52):**  People reach out to us on how to, you know, we want to be far more regenerative.  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:58):**  Where do we start?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:16:59):**  But to give an example, and maybe also links to your question that you started, do you  
**[0:17:04-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:17:04):**  see a change in the acceptance of region every year, the more adept of the world to that.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:17:11):**  And so we had a company, the first company that we've, we partnered up with, with an  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:17:17):**  existing entrepreneurial team was a Dutch spice entrepreneur.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:17:20):**  And then Tanzanian spice entrepreneur, they started working together.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:17:24):**  He was a spice farmer and yeah, the Dutch spice trader invested in him slowly buying  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:17:33):**  some produce and getting it into Europe.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:17:38):**  And when one of our marketing team members was talking to him, he said, yeah, we need  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:17:44):**  to, I see the problems in the world.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:17:47):**  He's actually of the generation that would normally not be so interested, but I think  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:17:50):**  he's a unique person and said, no, we need to work differently.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:17:54):**  I want to make an impact.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:17:56):**  And if I want to get, I see the problem in the spice industry, the problems of using  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:01):**  pesticides is enormous.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:03):**  EU is toughening regulations.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:05):**  So there's huge problems in India.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:06):**  I think in India, a lot of organic credit, a lot of organic organizations have lost licenses  
**[0:18:14-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:14):**  because of some, also pesticide residues.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:21):**  And he said, yeah, we need, we need alternatives.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:26):**  And if I want to, I want to be sure that I get sustainable spices out of Tanzania, I  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:33):**  need, I need this part to be covered.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:35):**  And that's how we started talking, looking into the company.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:40):**  They needed to raise finance.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:43):**  And eventually we said, yeah, we've, we've raised finance for companies that only existed  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:48):**  on paper.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:49):**  You have an amazing business.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:52):**  But yeah, that company was set up in Tanzania in a way, I think very pragmatic.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:18:58):**  You just start and see, and there was a lot of interest from buyers.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:19:06):**  They were scared about their current sourcing areas.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:19:10):**  You know, it's spicy, a lot of one sourcing, main sourcing area for one crop.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:19:15):**  And they said, yeah, we want to diversify.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:19:17):**  We see the risks.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:19:18):**  So that business picked up, but when we came in and we tried to partner up and he said,  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:19:25):**  okay, we don't, we're not consulted.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:19:27):**  So we want to be part of this company.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:19:30):**  And so we tried to figure out how can we become part of the company in the end, re-raise capital  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:19:37):**  to invest in this business.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:19:40):**  And that's also how our investment company was born.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:19:43):**  And we'll talk about that a bit later.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:19:44):**  It's a nice bridge, but let's unpack the spices a bit further.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:19:47):**  But yeah, we saw this business and I think it took us about, yeah, it took us a significant  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:19:54):**  amount of time and effort and resources to build a strong foundation for the business  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:20:00):**  to almost redo the business from scratch in some of the business fundamentals.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:20:05):**  So finance, legal, bookkeeping.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:20:10):**  One of our colleagues moved out there to live in, to live next to the factory and to live  
**[0:20:16-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:20:16):**  together with the entrepreneur to support him on some of the aspects that he wasn't  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:20:23):**  really, yeah, he didn't really come across in the past, so to speak.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:20:28):**  So he was really good with sourcing the produce.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:20:30):**  He was a spice farmer himself.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:20:33):**  So he knew quality, he knew how to get it, how to pack it and together with the Dutch  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:20:39):**  spice trader, how to process it, they get it EU ready.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:20:44):**  But that took so much of his time that I think all the admin was just laying there and we've  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:20:50):**  done all, we already done that, asked for new permits.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:20:54):**  We supported them on getting the organic certification with some support of the Dutch government  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:02):**  do out throughout that process.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:04):**  So that was super helpful.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:06):**  And in the end, yeah, we managed to get everything in order, raise some investments into this  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:10):**  company, become a co-owner of the business where indeed we again support a bit on strategy.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:15):**  Our region, every team is supporting their own region, every team so that they set up  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:21):**  in house and ideas.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:23):**  So what in the spices are the biggest challenges?  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:26):**  Like where would you like, where are they now, this company or where they're sourcing  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:30):**  from and where could that go to in terms of growing practices?  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:36):**  Is that super complex agroforestry systems?  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:39):**  Is it, what is, what do you see there to make that transition that the entrepreneur wanted  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:44):**  to get rid of a lot of the inputs and a lot of the risks and a lot of the fragility in  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:50):**  the system?  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:51):**  What do you see, where could the spices system go to?  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:53):**  Like, I don't know, describe it for us, let's say visually, because we're obviously an audio,  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:21:57):**  like what should we imagine when you say a spice farmer?  
**[0:22:00-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:22:00):**  Well then it's different around the world, but in Tenzen, yeah, what you see and where  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:22:09):**  the challenges are, where the opportunity are, first we choose spices because it's actually  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:22:13):**  in many instances a great agroforestry crop.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:22:17):**  But that's also where the challenge is because what you see is that if you, is that, you  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:22:24):**  know, natural forest would first be partly cleared for some under canopy growth of pepper  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:22:30):**  or cardamom.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:22:32):**  And if you don't replenish that system, you will see it deteriorates over time.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:22:38):**  That's been replaced by other crops that are less high value, more of the canopies is cut  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:22:46):**  and eventually you're left with cassava fields.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:22:49):**  And after the cassava, after a couple of years of cassava, your soil is drained.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:22:57):**  Now the advantage of these more tropical climates is that the region agri is generally a bit  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:23:05):**  easier, the more water, the faster it grows, the shorter the cycles, you have more growing  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:23:10):**  seasons.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:23:11):**  So obviously the benefit as well is that if we create a market for pepper and now for  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:23:17):**  organic pepper and try to work with the farmers to establish new plantations, eventually in  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:23:24):**  areas that are were previous spice areas, if we can bring them back into production,  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:23:30):**  you can automatically create some form of an agroforestry system.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:23:35):**  Now for us, obviously this is long trajectory and it starts with trying to maintain the  
**[0:23:41-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:23:41):**  current plantations.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:23:42):**  So get up production.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:23:46):**  Another example is there's a wilting problem.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:23:50):**  So Tanzanian government organisations are providing organic sprays for that.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:23:57):**  So that's super helpful, but the big problem is a lack of composting, proper moisture management  
**[0:24:03-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:24:03):**  on these plants.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:24:05):**  So I think our region agri team is working hard to find some small, make some practical  
**[0:24:11-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:24:11):**  interventions, how you can prevent that problem from starting in the first place.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:24:20):**  So I think these transitions and what we've learned in the past, these are very long timelines  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:24:25):**  and it starts with some of the quick wins, getting momentum with the first group of farmers  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:24:31):**  and then getting the same thing to a new group of farmers, but with your first group slowly  
**[0:24:36-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:24:36):**  advancing and yeah, it would be great if one day we can get that cassava fields back into  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:24:43):**  thriving agroforestry production areas because they would make much more money on that if  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:24:48):**  we do it properly.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:24:50):**  And if they don't have to sell out their pepper, you know, one month before harvesting, because  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:24:54):**  now sometimes they're selling at 30% of the value, just one month before harvesting because  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:00):**  they don't have the cash flow to get through that last month.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:03):**  And the classic trader farmer issue.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:06):**  Exactly.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:07):**  So those are the gains and it's a long trajectory, but we're taking it step by step, farmer by  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:13):**  farmer.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:14):**  I think the company sources for about 2000 farmers and I think what they do amazingly  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:20):**  and what we would have done wrong probably if we would have done it from scratch is they  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:26):**  really work well within the current system, within the middleman, within the traders,  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:31):**  taking it step by step.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:33):**  We would have thought, no, this needs to be radically different, which is super impressive  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:39):**  and impressive.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:40):**  And that's where I think the local entrepreneur and his skills really come into play and say,  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:44):**  no, you know, you don't want these guys.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:47):**  You need these middlemen.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:48):**  They know quality.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:49):**  They know where the farmers are.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:50):**  They know what good farmers rely on farmers.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:52):**  And if we can incentivize them a bit and get a relationship to pay a bit more at a certain  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:57):**  time and compensate him for that.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:25:59):**  And so they're working really well within the system step by step.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:26:02):**  And I think that's, yeah, that's super impressive and also really realistic of what they can  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:26:07):**  do today and what they can do tomorrow.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:26:10):**  But having this strong dot on the rise and you know, this is where we're going to and  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:26:13):**  we're doing it step by step.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:26:17):**  And I will put in the show notes, we did a very interesting interview earlier, I thought  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:26:21):**  on Centropic Agroforestry or how complex agroforestry can be.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:26:26):**  But also how, what the potential is of all the different layers.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:26:30):**  And also I think a good friend of the show, Massimiliano sent a video on, I think it was  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:26:37):**  disease on coffee and how that was caused by basically having the coffee plant in the  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:26:41):**  wrong spot in the height basically of the system while it was catching too much moisture  
**[0:26:47-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:26:47):**  and was getting sick because of that.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:26:49):**  So there's so many of these little things that if a system is done properly and properly  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:26:54):**  is a really weird word here, but there are many things you can avoid, but you have to  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:26:58):**  really understand, well, like where does the pepper want to be and where does it thrive  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:02):**  compared to the other plants in the system and how do you make sure, first of all, to  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:06):**  keep it obviously in a way that it doesn't deteriorate towards cassava.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:10):**  And then how do you make a system where the pepper actually thrives?  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:14):**  And those are questions we've asked ourselves.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:18):**  I mean, we've asked ourselves recently and probably a long time ago, but in the last  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:21):**  20 years, maybe not so much in these systems.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:24):**  Like what is a thriving pepper system?  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:26):**  I don't know if many people can answer that unfortunately, but it's a research that we  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:30):**  need to do because we need to know how to, and then how do we bring it back at speed  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:35):**  to grow these systems and not have to wait 20, 30 years.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:38):**  It's fascinating R&D in an already, let's say functioning system that is going and there's  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:43):**  being peppers being exported.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:45):**  It's not that you have to start from scratch like you used to do.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:48):**  So that's a big shift.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:49):**  And are you, I mean, this is a natural bridge towards GIC, let's say towards like doing  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:27:56):**  this partnering with and investing in existing companies more often.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:28:01):**  When did this realization came?  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:28:03):**  Was it with this example on the pepper side?  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:28:04):**  Like it's like, wow, there are actually entrepreneurs where we can add a lot of value.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:28:08):**  We can skip some steps and probably actually avoid some mistakes we would have otherwise  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:28:12):**  made if we would have gone into pepper, organic peppers, et cetera.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:28:15):**  Like when does that realization came and where is that now?  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:28:18):**  What is GIC and where is it going to go if it's up to you?  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:28:23):**  Yeah, so GIC stands for the Grounded Investment Company.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:28:29):**  And it came indeed from raising capital for this business.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:28:34):**  There's always been a bit of a push from investors to invest at a broader grounded level.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:28:42):**  But since we've always set up companies from scratch and with close partnership with other  
**[0:28:48-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:28:48):**  NGOs, existing partners, we've always raised that capital on an individual level.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:28:55):**  Which makes running grounded difficult.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:28:57):**  I think like the holding company or the company above it and you mentioned your legal team,  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:29:01):**  your region team, your sourcing team, of course, now, grounded ingredients, we'll talk about  
**[0:29:06-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:29:06):**  it later, is separate now.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:29:09):**  But there's a lot of support you give that is coming from a centralized team that has  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:29:15):**  to be paid for.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:29:16):**  So if all the money flows to the different operating companies, it's going to be tricky  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:29:20):**  for you guys or that was tricky.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:29:22):**  Yeah, no, 100%.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:29:25):**  But it's that, but it's also from investors.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:29:34):**  You know, they want to be part of the...  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:29:38):**  But it's also these companies now they are further down the line.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:29:40):**  So they have passed a certain state, they have some revenue.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:29:43):**  So it makes it interesting again for a new group of investors.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:29:47):**  And it makes it also more eligible for an investment company.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:29:55):**  And I think secondly for us, if we want to work with these organizations, they need capital  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:30:02):**  and they don't need all the capital upfront, but you know, to start up and going into a  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:30:07):**  new direction and expand the business.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:30:10):**  If you have some money ready and you don't have to, because with this spice company,  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:30:15):**  Trien, the challenge was that we didn't have the money upfront.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:30:19):**  And I think it would have saved us about half of the time.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:30:23):**  So about eight or nine months in all of the trajectory.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:30:27):**  If we would have had the money or at least part of the money to make an initial investment  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:30:30):**  and close a deal and get on.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:30:36):**  So the GIC is the combination of investing, but also with an active support arm.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:30:42):**  And that's what I've said in the past, a lot of investors wouldn't step into a company.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:30:50):**  Although we see a company with a lot of potential and a great entrepreneur.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:30:54):**  But a spice company in Tanzania is far away from any.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:30:59):**  Other investors see two guys that see a lot of risks.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:31:04):**  They think, okay, they see books being, you know, there's this difference.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:31:11):**  Admin is not there.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:31:12):**  It's not there.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:31:13):**  The admin is missing behind the books or yeah, organic certification is now pending for a  
**[0:31:19-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:31:19):**  while or and yeah, especially in every case.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:31:28):**  It gives you the investor, it gives the opportunity to step into a structure.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:31:33):**  Can we call it a fund?  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:31:34):**  No, it's not a fund like a structure that then invest in turn, invest in these kind  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:31:39):**  of the spice example, the pepper example we just mentioned, and then more like you invest  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:31:43):**  in a portfolio of these kind of companies and add of course, a lot of support.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:31:49):**  I mean, it's not just putting a few hundred thousand in spices and then good luck.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:31:53):**  No, I mean, what you mentioned now, it's the full thing on restructuring, on admin, on  
**[0:31:59-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:31:59):**  organic certification, on region, on the ground, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:32:05):**  But do you call it the fund?  
**[0:32:06-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:32:06):**  Like how do you call it as a structure?  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:32:07):**  Yeah, we call it an investment company because it's doing more than simply investing.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:32:13):**  But it is also a bit of fund alike.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:32:17):**  So you can, if you call it a fund, but we always try to frame it as a company because  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:32:23):**  it's a traditional company is a traditional funds.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:32:28):**  You know, people thinking about express that management fees and this, but there's a lot  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:32:33):**  of funds, traditional funds active in Africa, and I think they're missing out on a lot of  
**[0:32:38-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:32:38):**  opportunities.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:32:39):**  Because they're not investment ready yet.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:32:43):**  Not investment ready.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:32:45):**  And you see a lot of Western EU entrepreneurs and don't get me wrong, TechFlow and I are  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:32:50):**  part of it that they want to make an impact and why can you make an impact in Africa?  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:32:56):**  And they have a lot of things in order, you know, when it comes to reporting strong strategy  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:00):**  plans, strong business plans, strong impact plan.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:04):**  How do you get there?  
**[0:33:06-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:06):**  But they, and also struggle on you know, getting operations up.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:14):**  You know, in Africa, it's not the business plan that is the biggest challenge of making  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:17):**  a good business plan to be because that challenge is a good execution and you need a strong  
**[0:33:21-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:21):**  local team.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:23):**  So I would argue that's almost everywhere the case, but that's like, it's very nice.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:28):**  Everything sounds nice on PowerPoint, but especially in agriculture, like the context  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:33):**  locally, like if you, it sounds nice on PowerPoint to do certain things in Australia, but good  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:37):**  luck doing it if you're not deeply embedded there or in Italy or in the Netherlands as  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:42):**  we know well, or in Ecuador.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:45):**  I mean, this is not running a SaaS platform somewhere that you can almost run, I wouldn't  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:50):**  say from everywhere, but if your internet connection is okay, you sort of can.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:54):**  This is yeah, you have to dance the local dance, otherwise it's just going to go flat  
**[0:33:59-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:33:59):**  on your face.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:00):**  And we've seen many people going flat on their face.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:02):**  I think you've seen many as well.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:03):**  So you say they're missing out because it's not in that perfect clean order.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:08):**  The PowerPoint doesn't make complete sense yet, or is not there, but the business is  
**[0:34:12-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:12):**  there and the opportunity is there.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:15):**  And maybe I'm also now a bit harsh, but it's also our experience.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:20):**  And you know, we're very selective in the companies we work with because they have to  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:24):**  fit exactly in the type of experience that we as a team have.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:28):**  And we are also able to do it and able to see through and focus on these companies because  
**[0:34:34-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:34):**  we have set up very similar companies.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:36):**  We can't do this in a different sector or we can't do it in the energy sector.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:45):**  There's probably maybe some entrepreneurs there as well, but we wouldn't be able to  
**[0:34:48-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:48):**  do it because we don't have that specific experience.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:51):**  So it's also the experience that allows us to make some blends between being an investment  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:34:59):**  company and a business developer.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:35:03):**  When it's so specific, are you worried that you're not going to find many?  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:35:07):**  Like how likely, how many companies are you going to have in this company?  
**[0:35:12-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:35:12):**  What's your, like, is it a five, 10, 50 and how easy is it to find the perfect one?  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:35:20):**  Not perfect doesn't exist, but like this spice example in like the pepper one, like how big  
**[0:35:25-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:35:25):**  is your pipeline yet and how many do you need?  
**[0:35:28-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:35:28):**  Yeah, I have to say I was frightened sometimes to say, is this just a perfect example and  
**[0:35:36-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:35:36):**  are there many more?  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:35:37):**  But the goal is to do about one a year, two a year.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:35:42):**  Now especially in the early days, about one a year.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:35:46):**  And it's two ways that we have to make sure we also get a success out of the businesses  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:35:51):**  that are part of the investment company.  
**[0:35:54-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:35:54):**  But I think we can close a second year before the end of the year.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:36:00):**  I'm not going to deep into that, into the tea business.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:36:06):**  And I'm actually surprised.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:36:09):**  We set up a business development team or pipeline team set up a temporarily office in East Africa.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:36:15):**  So they switch a bit around Africa, set up temporarily offices and operate from that  
**[0:36:21-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:36:21):**  location for six to eight weeks.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:36:25):**  So that's also maybe answering a bit of your question, how we find them.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:36:30):**  Yeah, I was a bit relieved to see so many of these companies in our sweet spot.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:36:38):**  And I am now very confident that we can do more than one a year if we raise the capital.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:36:45):**  But in the end, it's not about the total volume.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:36:47):**  I think we take it step by step, company by company.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:36:52):**  But I think if we would bring it up to five, six over the coming four years about then,  
**[0:36:59-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:36:59):**  I think we're doing very well.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:37:01):**  It's also companies with significant opportunities for scaling.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:37:04):**  So that can absorb, you know, maybe initially need between 300 to $500,000 investment, but  
**[0:37:11-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:37:11):**  eventually can absorb three to $5 million investment within the next five to 10 years.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:37:18):**  So because there's a huge amount of supply available on either of these companies we're  
**[0:37:25-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:37:25):**  looking into.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:37:27):**  Yeah, and the market for teas, spices, coffee, cacao, but also mixed farm operations are  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:37:36):**  some of the operations we now look into.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:37:39):**  These markets are so big.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:37:40):**  So there's, for now there's enough opportunity and it's finding the right entrepreneur I  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:37:46):**  think is more important.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:37:48):**  And yeah, so far so very, very proud of the achievements of that of our pipeline team.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:37:56):**  I think it's super impressive also how not only finding them, but also working together  
**[0:38:04-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:04):**  with them to jointly make a business plan to present to our investment board into the  
**[0:38:11-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:11):**  investment company.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:12):**  So that's amazing.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:15):**  And you mentioned the investor side.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:18):**  How is that going?  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:19):**  How are investors responding to a fund not being a fund?  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:23):**  And because you said this was partly because investors have difficulty investing directly  
**[0:38:28-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:28):**  into these companies, unless they're really on the ground, unless they understand everything  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:32):**  and then they probably potentially don't need you.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:37):**  How is that being raising capital for, not for one company that you've always done until  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:43):**  now, but for a different suite of companies and a number of unknown companies yet.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:47):**  You can raise of course, for the Pepperone, for Ground Ingredients and Honeybush, but  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:52):**  not for a few others yet.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:53):**  They're not known yet.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:54):**  Yeah, maybe tea.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:38:55):**  But so how has that journey been or how has that switch been for you to start raising  
**[0:39:00-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:39:00):**  this capital?  
**[0:39:01-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:39:01):**  Yeah, there's been a huge range of different viewpoints, reactions, obviously.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:39:07):**  But one of the luxuries we have is that we have a couple of partners that really walked  
**[0:39:15-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:39:15):**  the journey alongside.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:39:17):**  I think you once gave us a couple of years or five years ago, the advice to bring some  
**[0:39:22-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:39:22):**  investors into your theatre, keep them up, take them along the journey.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:39:29):**  And so now part of the outcome of the journey is they said, no, don't raise too much capital  
**[0:39:33-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:39:33):**  up front.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:39:34):**  Go with an anchor investment, raise an investment to your first investment and raise a bit more  
**[0:39:40-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:39:40):**  investment when you have another opportunity.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:39:42):**  So we do more case by case with each round raising a bit more than we need.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:39:47):**  So slowly but surely working with larger rounds so we don't spend so much time.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:39:54):**  So that means you raised the one for the spices and now you're going to start talking about  
**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:39:58):**  the tea potentially, but you have a bit of time to do that.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:01):**  But of course, you want to have the money sort of almost ready when you go because otherwise  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:05):**  you have the same problem as before where you had to wait for the money to come and  
**[0:40:09-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:09):**  the company wanted to move.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:10):**  So it's chicken and egg.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:12):**  Yeah, that's what we call the product market do.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:16):**  It's always what comes first and you have to build them simultaneously.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:20):**  And that's what we're doing.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:21):**  And I think it's been, yeah, it's just we're just a bit lucky that, you know, the winds  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:28):**  are full in the sails on the first opportunity and on the pipeline.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:32):**  So yeah, sometimes you need to be a bit lucky.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:39):**  And since those things going really well, we can it's easier.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:42):**  It gets more traction, becomes more tangible.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:46):**  But we see we have a couple of investors that for which we still too small.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:51):**  So, you know, there's huge amounts of money from each source is committed to Africa, but  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:40:58):**  that allows for larger ticket size.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:00):**  We are still very conservative in what we promise.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:02):**  We don't want to overpromise.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:04):**  So we initially said about four to seven percent net return, meaning that two out of five companies  
**[0:41:10-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:10):**  need to be successful.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:11):**  But given now seeing how it goes, the type of pipeline and where these companies stand,  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:17):**  I think it's more realistic to assume that three or four out of five companies are going  
**[0:41:22-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:22):**  to succeed or not that three out of five companies would have to liquidate after a second or  
**[0:41:28-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:28):**  a third round of investment.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:29):**  So we've been very conservative, too conservative, I think, in our first instances, also driven  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:35):**  by our own experiences and knowledge.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:38):**  And we know how difficult it is.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:40):**  No.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:41):**  So I think we've always had a bit of a model try to.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:47):**  On the promise over deliver.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:49):**  And I think we've now that's that's maybe scared of maybe we've been too conservative.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:55):**  So we've been more optimistic there.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:41:59):**  But still, they're promising about 10 percent net return to investors for going into in  
**[0:42:05-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:05):**  Africa.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:06):**  That's that's still not super high, although there is potential that it can be much higher.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:13):**  But, yeah, we all know what happens.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:15):**  It can be a regime change or everything can happen.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:19):**  We've seen it all.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:20):**  Severe droughts.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:21):**  Look at the north of Kenya.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:23):**  If that happens in one of our areas, then, yeah, there's not a lot we can do.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:31):**  So but basically what it comes down to is that a lot of the huge amounts of money are  
**[0:42:36-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:36):**  basically become unavailable because they're distributed from funds to funds to funds.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:40):**  So even if their impact and let's say, two, three percent or four percent return target  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:44):**  on the top, when it's filtered down to the smaller investment funds with management layer  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:49):**  after management layer, you know, they already need 15 to 20 percent return.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:53):**  So we really target family offices, people that want to combine financial return with  
**[0:42:59-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:42:59):**  impact return.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:00):**  We are not there yet that we can provide the same financial return as the traditional private  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:08):**  equity and deliver on the impact.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:10):**  We we don't see that realistically happen in the short term.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:14):**  So that means you get a lot of impact through these businesses.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:20):**  But it also has a different risk profile as well.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:22):**  I mean, there's a different risk profile there.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:24):**  I think people really under I mean, you're selling real stuff.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:27):**  It's there will be demand for coffee, tea, spices, etc.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:31):**  If you're in a private equity fund, the risk is that nothing comes back in.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:37):**  I mean, the risk profile of certain payment app software things, etc. is very, very, very  
**[0:43:44-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:44):**  different.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:45):**  So I don't think it's very fair.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:46):**  Plus, I mean, in agriculture, people have to understand where we're operating in very  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:50):**  degraded landscapes where we extracted a lot of value over the last, let's say, hundreds  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:54):**  or in many cases, thousands of years.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:43:57):**  So there is a I wouldn't say a debt to pay, but there is a debt to pay there.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:00):**  There is money that needs to be resources, compost, organic matter, whatever you want  
**[0:44:04-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:04):**  to call it, that needs to flow back into that we cannot extract immediately or maybe we  
**[0:44:08-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:08):**  cannot extract ever.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:09):**  So there is something there on returns that if somebody promised you 25% on regen ag,  
**[0:44:15-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:15):**  I would ask a lot of questions.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:18):**  And because there is a debt to pay, we have to replenish the soils we have extracted so  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:25):**  much and the communities we've extracted so much value and capital from.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:29):**  So let's not kid ourselves.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:31):**  And a return is possible, but it's not going to be 20 plus, 30 plus or whatever the amount  
**[0:44:37-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:37):**  is, unless you maybe are in some technology companies.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:40):**  I mean, there, I see some possibilities for a short amount of time.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:44):**  We had an interesting interview with Mark Lewis of Trailhead Capital hunting for unicorns,  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:48):**  but then you have, you're investing in a very, very narrow, I'll put the link below, in a  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:53):**  very, very narrow part of the regen ag movement.  
**[0:44:57-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:57):**  If you're an ag, yeah, it's going to be different.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:44:59):**  I mean, I think a full grown old forest has a growth rate of 3% or something.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:45:03):**  So that might be the optimum at some point when ecosystems are mature, that's what we  
**[0:45:08-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:45:08):**  can harvest.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:45:10):**  And that's it.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:45:11):**  And, but let's not kid ourselves with crazy returns, but I imagine that's very, very difficult  
**[0:45:15-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:45:15):**  for you having to explain that to your investors and say, yeah, but I can go somewhere else  
**[0:45:19-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:45:19):**  and get this, of course, on paper, I get at XYZ, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:45:23):**  So it's a, yeah, it's a difficult dance.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:45:27):**  Yeah, 100%, but that's also why you and your podcast is so important.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:45:33):**  And I think that's a good thing to spread this message over and over and that it's not  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:45:40):**  only coming from us, but from a lot of different persons.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:45:44):**  So that's helping us tremendously.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:45:49):**  So please, please keep spreading that word.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:45:51):**  And we are trying to show that risks are lower because in the end value is total return or  
**[0:45:58-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:45:58):**  profits and risks.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:46:00):**  And with our approach, we try to de-risk investors.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:46:04):**  We do have investors that say, yeah, I was hesitant to make the step to Africa.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:46:09):**  You know, it's still this, this idea that you know, that people in Africa, it's difficult  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:46:15):**  sometimes.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:46:16):**  Can you trust people in Africa?  
**[0:46:17-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:46:17):**  If I'm sometimes at a party and say, can you trust them?  
**[0:46:20-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:46:20):**  And then I tell them, well the biggest challenge that we ever had was a European company that  
**[0:46:28-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:46:28):**  didn't promise on buying the produce at the price they promised.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:46:32):**  And later on, they turned out to use fraud scandal into that in that company.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:46:37):**  And so I said our biggest, we have ever been, you know, what's a decent word, screwed over  
**[0:46:45-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:46:45):**  and you have a decent, sorry, apologies, but scammed, scammed was with a European company.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:46:54):**  And if you have the right procedures in place and we've been around the whole.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:46:58):**  That's of course the issue that a lot of the money is far away outside Africa.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:02):**  We keep talking about like, it's one country beyond the continent, let's say, because it  
**[0:47:06-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:06):**  has been extracted in the past.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:08):**  It sits in very shiny offices, very far away from the place where it has been extracted.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:12):**  And are you working with local family offices, local, I mean, African family offices, South  
**[0:47:17-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:17):**  Africa and Zambia.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:19):**  Like, is that something that is happening on the impact side, something that you of  
**[0:47:24-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:24):**  course would love to, because they are much closer to the reality and you don't have to  
**[0:47:28-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:28):**  explain these kinds of things at parties.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:31):**  Like, is that something that starts to rise as well?  
**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:34):**  Like there are local money flowing into these kinds of things?  
**[0:47:38-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:38):**  More and more, a lot of the African wealth is still first generation.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:44):**  And I think if you look back to European family offices, you see significant differences through  
**[0:47:49-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:49):**  generations.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:50):**  Actually today there's an article in the newspaper about it and the challenge and invite into  
**[0:47:54-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:54):**  traditional family offices between generations.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:47:58):**  But especially in South Africa, you see with new generations, yeah, you see the change  
**[0:48:04-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:48:04):**  and actually we've just raised our first investment capital from South African family offices.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:48:11):**  One of actually the largest, I think, South African family offices, they invested in our  
**[0:48:15-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:48:15):**  Honeybush company with a very flexible instrument because they see, they want to change how  
**[0:48:25-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:48:25):**  we sell our businesses, how we run businesses in Africa.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:48:29):**  And they say that this Honeybush company provides a great opportunity to build a new industry  
**[0:48:36-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:48:36):**  and to build it in a different way.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:48:41):**  We've talked about Honeybush in the past in our previous podcast, so I won't go into detail  
**[0:48:46-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:48:46):**  too much.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:48:47):**  But, you know, these are family offices that, yes, for generations have been working in  
**[0:48:52-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:48:52):**  Africa and have been successfully investing throughout the continent.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:48:59):**  They are 100% aware of the trade-offs about and they see not only the risks, but also  
**[0:49:06-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:49:06):**  the opportunities.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:49:07):**  And, yeah, I've once met a family office, another Dutch family office, they were one  
**[0:49:12-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:49:12):**  of the first who went to China.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:49:15):**  Yeah, and they now look to Africa and they see opportunities.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:49:19):**  But I think that's still a small amount, a smaller group.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:49:24):**  But what helps is that the younger generation really sees Africa also for its potential,  
**[0:49:29-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:49:29):**  but also for its impact potential.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:49:31):**  But just the differences between the groups are huge and I think the vast majority still  
**[0:49:43-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:49:43):**  is probably run by people over, you know, that are more senior than you and I, let's  
**[0:49:50-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:49:50):**  say, more experienced than you and I.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:49:52):**  That's not annoying to many people listening to this.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:49:54):**  Yeah, but there is definitely in the family office business.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:49:57):**  Because our 60 year old spice trading partner is a front-rider.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:04):**  Usually with age, there is, I mean, with different generations and with age, there is logically  
**[0:50:09-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:09):**  because you are older, there is a certain resistance against change, a certain resistance  
**[0:50:14-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:14):**  against we always have done things like this.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:17):**  So we are always doing things like that.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:18):**  I think many farmers who are listening can attest to that if they're talking to their  
**[0:50:23-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:23):**  different generations, let's say their parents, and unless you had very, very forward thinking  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:29):**  or crazy parents, even organic is already tricky or messy fields are not the way we  
**[0:50:34-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:34):**  do it.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:35):**  Like the season only ends in the Netherlands, that's a nice saying, when the plow is cleaned  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:39):**  and stored away and all the fields are nicely dark and turned.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:44):**  And that's the same in family office in managing money.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:47):**  Every shift in, oh, let's look beyond risk and return and also to impact is a very fundamental  
**[0:50:53-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:53):**  shift.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:54):**  And it's not going to be easy for most people to join that if you've done differently for  
**[0:50:59-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:50:59):**  20, 30, 40 years.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:00):**  I mean, let's not get ourselves.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:02):**  And if you're a grown up in a different way and you've traveled the world and you've seen  
**[0:51:05-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:05):**  what other ways are there, of course, and you're 30, then it's very, very different.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:10):**  Not easy because you might not have the control.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:13):**  But yeah, you can definitely be sort of the quote unquote activist shareholder that with  
**[0:51:17-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:17):**  a very small percentage of the shares, try to move the gigantic company or the family  
**[0:51:23-0:51:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:23):**  office or the gigantic farm.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:25):**  I think the models are all the same.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:28):**  I think there's a big role for family offices that are front runners on this to show other  
**[0:51:35-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:35):**  family office how they are doing it, how they engage with the different generations and  
**[0:51:39-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:39):**  different models and how they slowly transition.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:43):**  And we try to get them to go out and visit our businesses.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:49):**  We say, just come out and see, see for yourself.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:52):**  I can't.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:53):**  I remember last time we talked like there's a 100% success rate when people visit.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:51:57):**  Like then it's yeah, you cannot not invest after.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:00):**  Not that because you forced them to, but because it's so interesting and you fall in love with  
**[0:52:04-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:04):**  the companies.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:05):**  So that's, but yeah, South Africa, Zambia, Tanzania is far literally and figuratively.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:10):**  So especially in these crazy COVID years, it's been difficult to travel, but you're  
**[0:52:15-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:15):**  hopefully you're getting a few people are like, let's say they're on the fence to come  
**[0:52:19-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:19):**  over, see it.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:21):**  And then, and then they can sign and get some money flowing back into the continent and  
**[0:52:25-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:25):**  back into the soil.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:27):**  But I have to say it's what you say.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:30):**  People come, they often invest.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:32):**  But that's also the challenge because the people that are more, that are actually thinking  
**[0:52:37-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:37):**  upfront, Hey, I'm going, this is a serious opportunity.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:40):**  They come and then, but I want people to come out that are really doubting.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:45):**  Then I really think, Hmm, I'm not sure.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:48):**  I don't think this getting those people to commit time out of their busy lives to visit.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:52):**  And hopefully I can join them with a nice safari or visiting big falls or whatever.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:52:58):**  Try to, to get them out and to see for themselves.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:00):**  And I think that's for us one of the challenges because it is so far away.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:05):**  And to see the difference between, between the farmers.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:10):**  But also it is challenging because I've also been on some of these trips and have seen  
**[0:53:19-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:19):**  only the good stuff.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:20):**  And I think we also, we've also, I've also seen, yeah, family officers say, yeah, we've,  
**[0:53:27-0:53:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:27):**  we've done trips of this and you only see the good things and you don't see the bad  
**[0:53:29-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:29):**  things.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:30):**  So yeah, this comes to the good, the bad and the ugly, but to everybody bringing people  
**[0:53:36-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:36):**  out show reality because we now seriously have people say, yeah, we've, we've done this  
**[0:53:42-0:53:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:42):**  in the past.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:43):**  We were super enthusiastic and we super disappointed by the actual results.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:47):**  So it's also something that's coming to us as an industry.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:51):**  Of course.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:52):**  And I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:53):**  We can talk for hours on the good, the bad and ugly and much more, but just as a very  
**[0:53:57-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:53:57):**  brief recap, how is Grounded Ingredients as we promised during this interview, how is  
**[0:54:03-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:03):**  that going?  
**[0:54:04-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:04):**  It launched after we talked last time.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:06):**  What has been happening with, what is first of all Grounded Ingredients and what has been  
**[0:54:10-0:54:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:10):**  happening the last, let's say 13 months?  
**[0:54:12-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:13):**  No, yeah.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:14):**  Grounded Ingredients was for us a way to basically change a bit of the current middle segment  
**[0:54:22-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:22):**  in the value chain.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:24):**  The current wholesale companies, these companies are, especially for example, in Germany, there's  
**[0:54:32-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:32):**  a tremendous amount of family companies that buy produce from all over the world, blend  
**[0:54:39-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:39):**  it, get it up to a minimum standard and sell it.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:43):**  Now if you are, they provide a great low cost, reliable, same tasting, meeting minimum standards  
**[0:54:52-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:52):**  product.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:53):**  We're talking about tea or what are we talking about?  
**[0:54:55-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:54:55):**  We talk about tea, we talk about spices, we talk about the high-end cash crops.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:55:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:55:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:55:02):**  And with coffee, the good thing about coffee, it's, in your podcast is often referred to  
**[0:55:08-0:55:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:55:08):**  and we refer to it in one of our previous podcasts, like the winification of the industry.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:55:13):**  So you see coffee from a certain source, a certain farm, a certain...  
**[0:55:18-0:55:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:55:18):**  You're trying to basically supply the next winification of the things after the coffee  
**[0:55:23-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:55:23):**  bean, like bean to bar, the whole movement.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:55:27):**  The biggest drive for the transition to Regen Agri is quality and the current system doesn't  
**[0:55:38-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:55:38):**  give a much better price for a better quality.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:55:42):**  We as Rauner are not a business to consumer people, so to speak, but there's amazing brands  
**[0:55:49-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:55:49):**  that want to play a big part in changing the food system and over the whole.  
**[0:55:55-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:55:55):**  So from Kombucha to tea brands to coffee brands, they do an amazing work, spreading work, but  
**[0:56:01-0:56:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:56:01):**  they hit so many barriers for them to source.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:56:05):**  You know, coffee companies, one thing, but the tea company, any tea brands, maybe they  
**[0:56:10-0:56:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:56:10):**  have 50 to 100 ingredients in their portfolio.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:56:12):**  So how do they source it?  
**[0:56:16-0:56:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:56:16):**  We initially set up grounded ingredients to provide a platform for some of the suppliers  
**[0:56:25-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:56:25):**  and processing companies in South Africa that we were inspired by.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:56:30):**  We've came across so many also in a pipeline where not all of them, you know, we work together  
**[0:56:34-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:56:34):**  with, but we were super inspired about the impact, the agricultural progress that they  
**[0:56:40-0:56:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:56:40):**  make from super innovative Roybal's farmer to a super innovative beekeeping farmer, which  
**[0:56:49-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:56:49):**  tried to try to get organic, which is almost impossible for beekeeping for many, many multiple  
**[0:56:54-0:56:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:56:54):**  reasons.  
**[0:56:55-0:57:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:56:55):**  But we wanted to provide them a platform and that was a start of grounded ingredients.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:00):**  But now it's actually that's more of a showroom.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:05):**  But what the result has been is that especially from the US and from some EU brands, we are  
**[0:57:12-0:57:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:12):**  now talking to take off part of their sourcing.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:14):**  So we become more than...  
**[0:57:16-0:57:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:16):**  They outsource the sourcing to EU basically like for this part of our portfolio of ingredients  
**[0:57:20-0:57:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:20):**  that I need to buy, which is not just this type of tea, but it's also all the other ingredients  
**[0:57:24-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:24):**  because I'm making these funny mixes and infusions, etc.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:28):**  Like please source it for us with the high quality standards and all the agriculture  
**[0:57:33-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:33):**  practices and the good stories because obviously these brands need stories, but it's not that  
**[0:57:36-0:57:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:36):**  they can do 50 tea ingredients throughout Southern Africa or East Africa.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:42):**  That's impossible for...  
**[0:57:43-0:57:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:43):**  It's possible for the Unilevers of this world, but not for these smaller, very mission focused.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:48):**  It's not that they have people just doing that.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:51):**  That's not relevant for them.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:53):**  So they end up sourcing from the commodity side of things, which is a shame because that's  
**[0:57:57-0:57:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:57):**  not why they started.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:57:58):**  So they basically outsource.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:01):**  They basically tell you, okay, this part of the portfolio, please go and find it.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:05):**  And you say, okay, let's get going.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:07):**  That's it.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:08):**  And then we try to bundle it.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:09):**  Obviously, we pick our customers at this stage to see, okay, where's the overlap in portfolio  
**[0:58:14-0:58:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:14):**  so that one or two sourcing managers can check it.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:20):**  We also started providing some of our region, every team capacity to these suppliers by  
**[0:58:25-0:58:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:25):**  these buyers paying a small premium on it.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:28):**  That goes to our region agri team.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:31):**  We've also have a...  
**[0:58:32-0:58:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:32):**  That's another thing we set up our own region agri finance, transition finance facility  
**[0:58:36-0:58:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:36):**  to do more research and more support to these types of supplies.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:39):**  Also subsidize that a bit where we raise some money from other family offices to subsidize  
**[0:58:45-0:58:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:45):**  that.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:46):**  But indeed they say, okay, this is our sourcing list.  
**[0:58:50-0:58:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:50):**  Yeah, we want to be traceable.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:52):**  Two out of 50 products are now traceable.  
**[0:58:56-0:58:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:56):**  There's not.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:58:57):**  And then we say, okay, we know that these products we have in our portfolio, we know  
**[0:59:00-0:59:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:59:00):**  good suppliers or for these products, we think we can find good suppliers.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:59:05):**  And yeah, then we take on a bit of a more traditional role and we say, we buy it, we  
**[0:59:09-0:59:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:59:09):**  store it, we bundle it, we ship it, and we keep it ready for you when you need it.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:59:14):**  But we try to combine it with full transparency and saying, this is what we've bought from  
**[0:59:19-0:59:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:59:19):**  the farmers, this is our cost, this is our market fee, this is our fee for the region  
**[0:59:23-0:59:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:59:23):**  agri facility.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:59:25):**  And yeah, we've been inspired by some of the businesses to come up with a name that they  
**[0:59:31-0:59:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:59:31):**  say, if you source enough, you go directly to your customer, but we believe that we can  
**[0:59:36-0:59:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:59:36):**  add a lot of value.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:59:37):**  So there's obviously conflict between sometimes our wholesale company and you would say between  
**[0:59:42-0:59:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:59:42):**  some of our operating companies.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:59:44):**  But what we see is that our wholesale companies often much better in supplying these companies  
**[0:59:49-0:59:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:59:49):**  and cheaper and more affordable because they bundle the ingredients, bring it all together.  
**[0:59:56-1:00:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=0:59:56):**  So then it's for our operating companies more interesting to sell via that route.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:00:01):**  But we also say to the customers, one day, if you want to buy so much of black pepper  
**[1:00:05-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:00:05):**  and you can go straight to go straight.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:00:09):**  So that's a bit of where we work on.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:00:11):**  And I think these brands have, if you have your own such a brand, you need to spend 80%  
**[1:00:18-1:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:00:18):**  of your time on telling the story, going out to the public.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:00:22):**  That's time that we don't, that's something we don't do.  
**[1:00:25-1:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:00:25):**  You tried that, you were flirting with that years ago.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:00:29):**  I remember you were flirting with that, but decided that's not your role.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:00:32):**  No, it's amazing.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:00:33):**  I think for, I see amazing work in the Netherlands for livestock farmers that have their own  
**[1:00:40-1:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:00:40):**  milk fresh to the market, but with these longer chains, chains that we are involved in and  
**[1:00:46-1:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:00:46):**  the wide range of products.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:00:49):**  And because I'm not an Instagram person, maybe.  
**[1:00:53-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:00:53):**  So yeah, somebody else needs to do that.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:00):**  And everybody has a role to play.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:03):**  And you know, even if we would have a successful own brand, there's so much volume here, maybe  
**[1:01:07-1:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:07):**  0.1% of the volume.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:10):**  But if there's hundreds of brands, you know, using our ingredients and using, well, not  
**[1:01:15-1:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:15):**  our ingredients, the ingredients of, you know, some of the top suppliers, and we do have  
**[1:01:19-1:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:19):**  the skills to assess them.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:20):**  We do have the skills to support the supplies.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:22):**  We do have the skills to test the produce.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:25):**  We do have the skills to support them on certification, to support them in the transition.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:29):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:30):**  Let us try and focus on that.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:32):**  It's also an interesting pipeline for our go model.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:35):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:36):**  And if you can connect to markets, I mean, everything changes.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:41):**  Markets, good prices, okay payment schemes, plus transition, a bit of transition finance  
**[1:01:48-1:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:48):**  support.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:49):**  And I mean, but yeah, good off-take agreements, good markets, focus on quality and of course,  
**[1:01:55-1:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:55):**  margin back to the farmers and to the land changes the game.  
**[1:01:58-1:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:01:58):**  Like there's no question on that.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:00):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:01-1:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:01):**  And last release, we were raising about three to 400K for this for grounded ingredients.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:09):**  And yeah, it started off more as a platform, but now the good thing is it's more demand  
**[1:02:13-1:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:13):**  driven.  
**[1:02:14-1:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:14):**  So we take up a bit of funding, you know, as soon as we need more working capital and  
**[1:02:19-1:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:19):**  more clients come in.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:20):**  So there's immediate off-take.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:21):**  So that de-risk that whole business a lot and make sure that the portfolio creation  
**[1:02:28-1:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:28):**  is much more demand driven.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:30):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:31):**  And it's nice that sometimes, you know, the optimist beats the perfectionist, you know,  
**[1:02:40-1:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:40):**  we've just started this and we thought, let's put them on the website and people started  
**[1:02:44-1:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:44):**  to buy samples.  
**[1:02:46-1:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:46):**  And actually, I think most of the sales via the website with samples and then people say,  
**[1:02:51-1:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:51):**  yeah, but we actually need this and this.  
**[1:02:53-1:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:53):**  And then we became more of that wholesale company, but more demand driven.  
**[1:02:58-1:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:02:58):**  And I think that, yeah, that's all been in a timeframe of about six months that you were  
**[1:03:04-1:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:04):**  running that you go into this and that is almost all 80% of our time and effort to go  
**[1:03:10-1:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:10):**  to meet the demands for these, some of these clients.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:13):**  And that's a super mobile luxury to have.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:17):**  And again, it's a great problem to have.  
**[1:03:19-1:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:19):**  Yeah.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:20):**  Yeah.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:21):**  That's yeah.  
**[1:03:22-1:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:22):**  And, you know, these companies, they value, you know, the origin, they value if there's  
**[1:03:26-1:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:26):**  differences and if there's a better quality, they don't mind if there's a different taste  
**[1:03:31-1:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:31):**  of it, there's different vintage for the tea.  
**[1:03:33-1:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:33):**  If there's day-spreading.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:34):**  The winification again.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:35):**  Yeah.  
**[1:03:36-1:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:36):**  The winification.  
**[1:03:37-1:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:37):**  And, ah, it's a relief to work with, with, with these, these people that really dive  
**[1:03:45-1:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:45):**  into the details and try to understand and come to visit.  
**[1:03:50-1:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:50):**  But, um, uh, that's if you, how, if you ask me, how do you keep up yet also the energy  
**[1:03:57-1:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:03:57):**  of these people to make a change and to spread the word and to tell the story and to provide  
**[1:04:03-1:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:04:03):**  people with the best tea or the best products.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:04:05):**  And if they then come to work with you on their ingredients, yeah, that gives so much  
**[1:04:09-1:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:04:09):**  energy.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:04:10):**  So that's, um, yeah.  
**[1:04:11-1:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:04:11):**  So yeah, it started a bit of an in-house trial, the small scale with a couple of team members  
**[1:04:18-1:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:04:18):**  that came up with it and now it's growing like that.  
**[1:04:21-1:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:04:21):**  So that's, uh, that's just super, um, super to see.  
**[1:04:25-1:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:04:25):**  And then you see that the whole industry is changing because I think if we would have  
**[1:04:29-1:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:04:29):**  done something similar six, seven years ago, it wouldn't have taken off this way.  
**[1:04:34-1:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:04:34):**  The brands would not have asked for this.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:04:37):**  And, um, some research, if you see that, that the whole top segment is that growth is taken  
**[1:04:44-1:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:04:44):**  off by these type of front runners, you see that the world is changing and that, uh, the  
**[1:04:51-1:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:04:51):**  new generations, they want a different product.  
**[1:04:53-1:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:04:53):**  And, uh, yeah, if we can get great ingredients with full transparency, um, and, and support  
**[1:05:01-1:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:01):**  these producers with a constant, you know, continuous improvement on Regen Agri because  
**[1:05:05-1:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:05):**  the nice thing about Regen Agri, you're never finished.  
**[1:05:09-1:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:09):**  You can always do it.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:10):**  It just theoretically means the quality is never done as well.  
**[1:05:12-1:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:12):**  Like the winification will continue into, yeah, you're never done reaching, reaching  
**[1:05:17-1:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:17):**  for the top.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:18):**  I want to thank you so much guys for this, for this update.  
**[1:05:21-1:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:21):**  It's not the last time we're talking, you will be back.  
**[1:05:23-1:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:23):**  Um, and with other people of the team as well, there's so much to, to unpack here as this  
**[1:05:28-1:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:28):**  model has been, uh, and the work at Grounded has been, I wouldn't say shifting, but like  
**[1:05:33-1:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:33):**  morphing into different forms and shapes.  
**[1:05:36-1:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:36):**  Every time we talk to you, you've made so many steps forward and a few steps backwards  
**[1:05:39-1:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:39):**  to learn.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:40):**  Um, so thank you so much for your time and good luck and we'll check in soon.

**[1:05:46-1:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:46):**  Thanks for having us again, not having me this case again, uh, Koon, but, um, yeah,  
**[1:05:50-1:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:50):**  I would love to come back in maybe a year's time to, uh, to tell more about how we're  
**[1:05:55-1:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:05:55):**  doing and keep all of your listeners informed about, uh, the progress and the next hurdles  
**[1:06:00-1:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:06:00):**  and do's that we jumped through.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:06:05):**  Thank you so much for listening all the way to the end.

**[1:08:02-1:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:08:02):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.

**[1:08:17-1:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:08:17):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:08:19-1:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gijs-boers#t=1:08:19):**  Thank you.

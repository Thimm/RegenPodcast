**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:14):**  Finally a check-in with one of the oldest and most successful asset managers in regenerative  agriculture.  After five years he's back on the podcast to share the updates on their investment strategies  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:24):**  in Australia and the US, the forestry fund in Ireland and their latest strategy, a 250  million tree crop fund focused on Europe.  Why are they focusing on orchards, tree crops, etc. and why on Europe?  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:39):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:52-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:00:52):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:05):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:16):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:28):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:41):**  Thank you.  Welcome to another episode today with the co-founder of SLM Partners, Paul McMahon.  Welcome back on the show, Paul.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:49):**  Hi, Kon.  Great to be here and great to talk to you again after so many years.  Yeah, we do check in and chat in the meantime, but the last episode we recorded was number  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:01:57):**  three actually, which is five years ago.  One of the first episodes we ever recorded.  So I'm very happy to have you back.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:03):**  I'm very happy that SLM Partners is still alive and kicking in the region egg investment  space and if we can have this update.  Brilliant.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:10):**  Great to be here and yeah, I look forward to fill you in some of the things we've been  working on and what we're planning to do in the next few years.  Absolutely.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:16):**  So let's start with a brief overview.  I will obviously link the interview we did five years ago in the show notes below plus  links to the website, et cetera.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:24):**  But in a few sentences, where is SLM or a few more sentences, I mean, we have time.  Where does SLM stand as we're talking now, November 2021?  Yeah, so it's been a busy five years since we last spoke.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:36):**  You know, I think we're continuing to develop a asset management firm that can use investment  capital to scale up more regenerative ecological farming and forestry systems.  That's always been the mission since we started 10 years ago and that's still very much at  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:49):**  the core of what we do.  We've got three different strategies now around the world.  We actually started in Australia where we raised a grass fed beef cattle fund 2012.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:02:57):**  I know you've had my partner Tony Lovell on the show a couple of times.  We sadly passed away recently, but we're continuing that work in Australia.  We acquired over a million acres of land.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:08):**  We're using holistic plant grazing to restore grasslands in a big way.  We also have some quite big carbon projects there, which have been a great success.  So that's in Australia.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:16):**  In the US, we have a team out of New York where we are investing in organic farming.  And our core strategy there is we find organic farmers, mostly grain farmers in the Midwest  who want to grow.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:27):**  We work with them to find land.  We then acquire that land and enter into long-term leases with the farmers.  So 10 year leases on quite flexible terms, which really helps them through that organic  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:36):**  transition and gives them long-term access to land as well.  And that's been going well.  We set up a couple of separate accounts.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:41):**  One with a very large institutional investor.  We've bought about 10 farms over the last two years.  And we're actually participating in three or four different auctions this week.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:50):**  So hopefully we'll have some more by the end of this week.  So that's been going well.  And then in Europe, we raised a forestry fund in 2018.  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:03:58):**  Focus on Ireland, my homeland.  We raised a fund backed by the European Investment Bank's natural capital financing facility  and most European investors.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:05):**  And what we'll be doing there is acquiring existing semi-mature forest properties, which  have been built up through government grants and government support over the last 20 years.  A little bit neglected now, quite fragmented.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:17):**  So we're aggregating them into a portfolio, putting them under professional management.  But the key impact story there is shifting away from the conventional methods of forestry  in Ireland, which is very much based on clear felling and monocultures.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:29):**  Shifting away from that to something called continuous cover forestry.  So we maintain permaforest cover.  We selectively harvest.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:35):**  We promote more diversity within the forest.  We think we get a great commercial result, but also get a lot of environmental benefits  as well.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:41):**  So that fund's been 80% deployed.  We bought a lot of properties.  It's going well.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:44):**  And it's very pleased with that.  So I think altogether now we've got almost $200 million in assets in the management.  We're just as excited as ever about what we find on the ground, talking to these great  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:04:55):**  farmers, great foresters who have expertise in ecological management, which are profitable.  Has that changed a lot?  Has that shifted?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:02):**  What have you seen on the ground?  I don't think it's shifted.  I think those farmers and foresters have always been there.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:08):**  And I think probably just more time has passed.  Therefore, yes, more proof, let's say, in demonstration of track record or an impact  and profitability is there.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:17):**  I think then there are market forces continue to align to get behind some of these ideas  too, whether that's the growth of organic food markets, whether it's new regenerative  agriculture schemes, whether it's a keener focus on multifunctional forestry.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:35):**  So I think, yes, certainly the consumer demand and policy regulatory environment continues  to shift in its favor.  But I think the operators will have been doing this quietly for decades.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:43):**  Just now maybe they're getting a bit more attention, which is a good thing.  And on the investor side, has it shifted over the last, I hope so, but I'm looking forward  to hear from you in the last five years, because I remember with Tony when I met him, I think  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:05:55):**  11 years ago, let's say the first managed grazing, holistic managed grazing fund, I  think one of the first in the world in Australia, it wasn't easy even mentioning grazing differently  or grass.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:07):**  There was a lot of explanation explaining to do in this case.  Do you see that?  I really hope you say yes.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:13):**  But did you see that it has shifted even in the last five years?  What is your feeling on the ground of the investor side of things, not necessarily the  land steward?  
**[0:06:19-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:19):**  Yeah, I think probably the biggest change has been on the investor side.  There's definitely much greater appetite for what we do.  I think it's driven by two things.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:26):**  On the one hand, you have almost a purely financial imperative where you have big institutional  investors worried about low yields from bonds, overpriced equities, looking for diversification,  carving allocations to real assets.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:40):**  Within real assets, then they might do infrastructure, real estate, but increasing now allocating  maybe 1%, 2% to timber and farming.  So I think we're seeing more and more of that, more of these allocations to our area because  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:06:51):**  they want diversification, inflation, hedging and purely financial, let's say, characteristics.  But then of course, the other big driver is really coming from more the impact side.  It's coming from climate change and policy and drivers.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:03):**  There's a huge interest in nature-based climate solutions at the moment, in biodiversity,  waste restoring, carbon in the ground, on the ground.  So I think that's, and a lot of these investors are making commitments themselves to their  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:13):**  stakeholders which they need to meet.  And so managers who can put together strategies with the right institutional scale and quality  and the right persistence and processes, I think we'll get a good reception now, more  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:24):**  so than say five years ago.  And now you sort of extended your view on Europe.  I mean, you're focused obviously on the continuous cover.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:32):**  The forestry side of things, which we talked about in the last interview, and also you  wrote a great white paper on it.  I will link it below because it's very, it can be very visual as well to see the difference  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:41):**  between clear fell, which just for the listeners is basically a mature forest where all the  trees are the same size and height and they're cut at exactly at the same time.  So you see this big scar in the middle of the landscape left and right, you see still  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:07:53):**  the forest that is maybe going to cut next year or in two years time, compared that to  continuous cover, basically very selectively harvesting.  So you can see some great comparison in photos and why it makes a lot of sense also from  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:05):**  the return perspective, which is great when you're talking to pure financial investors.  So I will link that white paper below and you see the results in Ireland.  And you decided that, let's say you wanted to focus more on permanent crops in Europe.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:19):**  Why that focus?  I mean, you're doing a lot of work in the US.  I think there's an endless appetite there for organic shifts, et cetera.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:25):**  And yet you decided to not focus on that for the next five years.  But actually, I mean, that will continue, but also set up a more pure focused strategy  in Europe and beyond Ireland because that obviously that work continues.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:36):**  Yeah, no, we'll continue our work in the US and we're looking to actually expand there  and not away from organic grains towards more permanent crops to actually to separate canister  actually.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:45):**  So it's kind of nice in a way the two geographies are going in parallel.  I think in Europe, we were having a great experience with the Irish Forestry Fund, but  we're coming to close to full deployment thinking what to do next.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:08:54):**  And we'd love to do a second fund in Europe.  And one thing we found in Ireland is while the investment thesis really works, there  is a limit to how much scale you can get.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:02):**  It just goes to small country and fragmented forest estate.  And so if we wanted to develop a more institutional scale and quality fund, then we would need  to look to a broader set of European geographies.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:12):**  So we started looking at other European geographies, looking at forestry.  I think we also decided to then expand away from pure forestry towards more permanent  crop orchard systems where we found some really good opportunities in Spain and Portugal,  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:23):**  as well as more mixed agroforestry systems where you're mixing trees with grazing or  trees for crops.  So I think what we're designing now is a broader pan-European tree crop fund.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:34):**  We're looking to raise 250 million euros.  Sorry, 250, 250.  250 million euros, yeah.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:41):**  About half of that will be allocated to forestry, but the other half will be allocated to permanent  crops, orchard crops, Mediterranean food crops, as well as agroforestry systems.  Investing in a number of countries, so Ireland, but also looking at the Baltic states, looking  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:54):**  at Spain and Portugal.  And we'll continue to look at some other geographies as well.  So yeah, I think we're very excited with that.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:09:59):**  We're building up a team in the UK and Ireland and also in Spain and Portugal, executing  that.  And we've had a first close, back with some family offices and hoping to do our first  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:07):**  investments in Spain and Portugal in the next few weeks, actually, which are coming together.  Busy weeks, busy weeks.  And so what made that shift possible or interesting for you from pure forestry, which you could  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:20):**  have done, let's say, a continuous forest fund in Europe focused on the Baltics.  I mean, there are other places where there's space beyond Ireland, but you decided to expand  that vision beyond pure forestry into orchards, into maybe even some silver pasture, etc.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:35):**  What was that?  What made you interested in the food side of things?  But what made you decide to mix those things in one fund?  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:41):**  Yeah, I would say I think there are some limitations to scalability in forestry in Europe.  We have looked at multiple countries now over the last two years.  And yes, there are pockets of opportunity, but I think there's also certain countries  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:10:53):**  where it can be hard to invest, maybe because land might be controlled by the governments,  by the state, maybe because actually asset prices have been bid up so high now that the  returns are super low.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:04):**  So I think we have seen pockets of opportunity, but I don't think it's hard to get the kind  of scale which investors are used to in the US or Australia, Latin America.  So I think that that was one of the impulses for us to look more broadly.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:15):**  I think also as a firm, we've done work in grazing, we've done work in annual cropping  systems, organic systems, and we've done work in forestry.  In a way, the last piece of the puzzle was these permanent crop systems.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:26):**  And so it's something that we've always been interested in, and we've always thought there's  opportunities there.  And I think it's always been probably almost a question for the team as well, what does  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:34):**  regenerative agriculture look like within a permanent crop system?  What does it mean for permanent crops?  Because one thing we found is regenerative agriculture movement is much more developed  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:43):**  when it comes to grazing livestock, when it comes to annual cropping systems.  But you start digging into permanent crops and orchard systems that you don't find the  same body of research, the same definitions, or the same, let's say, agreement in what  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:11:55):**  it really means.  So that became a really interesting puzzle for us to try and then to work through.  And I think as we dig in and as we found some great operators in Spain and Portugal and  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:04):**  elsewhere doing some amazing things, we got more and more excited about the opportunities  that were there.  And I think the final point is we wanted to build a diversified portfolio.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:15):**  So I think there's an attraction to that for investors.  So it's forestry, which is selling to timber markets.  You have almonds or olives or pistachio orchards selling to food markets.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:24):**  And we're also looking at something like cork, growing cork, which is selling in a completely  different market for wine bottle stoppers and other uses.  So they're completely uncorrelated.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:33):**  So you get amazing diversification if you invest in these wide range of tree crops.  I think the final point, though, as well, is around carbon.  I think the other real goal of this fund is to build a climate positive portfolio where  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:43):**  we're storing more carbon than we emit and having a focus on tree crops, broadly defined,  really gives you that.  Whether it's forestry, whether it's permanent crops, you're storing a huge amount of carbon  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:12:52):**  within that woody biomass as well as in the soil.  Can you describe, obviously visually as we're in a podcast, but how would an orchard look  like and how would it be different from, let's say, a neighbor or somewhere down the street  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:05):**  or the path where they are not applying regenerative practices?  Like what have been things that you found in this journey when you're finding these  operators, these farmers that are doing things that you get excited about?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:17):**  What should we envision?  Because we don't talk about olives very much or almonds.  I mean, sometimes when we talk about common land and some others, but you're right, we  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:25):**  usually talk about livestock, annual crops, maybe market gardens, et cetera, but not so  much about the perennial ones.  So take us on a journey to some of the exciting ones in Portugal and Spain that hopefully  
**[0:13:35-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:35):**  soon will be part of the portfolio.  Yeah, yeah.  So I think there's two reasons why we like perennial crops.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:42):**  I think first just the financial returns.  In many cases, these orchard systems are growing high value food products, which are much in  demand, whether it's almonds, or azaleas, pistachios, vegetarian products, and have  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:13:55):**  a lot of uses.  And as we see shifts in diet, whether it's away from meat, towards almond milk, or whether  it's just towards that Mediterranean diet, which has all the proven health benefits,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:04):**  we see increasing demand for these products.  They can be grown in relatively small regions of the world, which have a Mediterranean climate.  So there's a lot of places where you can grow them.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:13):**  A lot of places where they are growing, such as California, are quite stressed by water  scarcity at the moment.  So that's an understatement.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:19):**  Yeah.  So we think there's a really nice alignment of factors there, which mean that these are  good areas to invest, you can produce good returns if you're growing these products.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:27):**  That's the first point.  I think the second is again going back to carbon, what I mentioned before.  When done well, these systems can store carbon.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:34):**  If you think of carbon in farming or in landscapes, there's almost a clear tiering that goes on,  where yes, you can make gains in annual cropping systems, but they're probably the smallest  gains per hectare.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:45):**  The next step is grazing or shifting from annual cropping to perennial grasslands that  stores carbon.  But then the third after that is permanent crop systems, perennial woody tree crops,  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:14:55):**  and then beyond that forestry.  So we think it's going to be good for climate, good for the environment to take some of the  degraded land, which is then being over-tilled and over-exploded for annual agriculture,  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:05):**  and shifting to these more perennial systems.  So that's the macro trend we like.  The reality, of course, is that if you look at these orchard systems now as they're conventionally  
**[0:15:14-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:14):**  managed, there can be quite a few problems associated with them.  They tend to be very intensively managed, relying on heavy use of inputs, whether it's  synthetic fertilizer, pesticides, chemicals, and of course, heavy water users as well.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:26):**  There can be a whole set of issues around soil degradation, around nutrient runoff,  around pesticide toxicity for farm workers and local communities, and sometimes actually  quite high emissions associated with the operations, even if the trees themselves are storing carbon.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:41):**  So I think that's what's propelled us to look for these more regenerative alternatives.  We have found them.  I think probably the key principles of what we're seeing in these well-managed, I'd say  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:15:51):**  more regenerative orchards, first, a focus on cover crops.  So trying to really move away from bare soil and deliberately planting cover crops in between  rows to serve a soil protection function, but also a fertility function too, and as  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:04):**  you can grow some of that nitrogen maybe for the tree crops.  I think the second thing we're seeing is a stronger use of biological fertility rather  than synthetics.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:13):**  Whether that's compost, whether it's some more specialized liquid or biological fertility  products, but we've seen some really amazing results from compost and even biochar in our  orchard systems.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:22):**  And I think there's a lot more potential there, that sort of shift happens.  Probably the third then is around integrated pest management, so really trying to reduce  pesticide use.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:31):**  And how do you do that?  Well, it could be interplanting beneficial plants in pollinator habitats, like having  a healthy insect ecosystem, which is going to keep some of those undesirable bugs under  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:42):**  control.  And so it's actually having more of a landscape approach and thinking what you do between  the rows around the borders.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:48):**  Does it also mean making the rows less of a monoculture as mixing them with other species?  Do you see that?  Or is that becomes difficult with harvesting and things like that?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:16:58):**  Is it mostly pistachios and that's it?  Or do you see also there from the pest perspective or the pressure that it makes sense to have  certain oaks in the middle or something else?  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:09):**  Pesticulture cropping is a great idea in theory, but I think there you quickly run up probably  the other major challenge facing all agricultural systems.  I think in particular orchard systems at the moment, which is a lack of agricultural labor.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:20):**  This is the big challenge, whether you're in California, whether you're in Europe, in  Australia, finding people to work on the land is really, really hard.  So I think we're seeing shift towards more mechanization.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:31):**  And so the successful systems will be those which are designed to be mechanized.  There's those machines replacing people, hopefully machines replacing chemicals too to an extent  actually.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:40):**  So this is I think the really positive side of that, where you're doing more mechanical  weed control rather than spraying everything down with chemicals.  I think it does put a little bit of a constraint on what you can do as intercropping.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:50):**  You can have a most beautiful one-hectare farm forestry system where one person devotes  their life to managing that.  It can be incredibly productive, but it's very, very hard to scale.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:17:59):**  And so I think we still think there's a huge potential to do things within more intensive,  larger scale mechanized systems.  But there you're focusing on what you plant within the rows, probably more in terms of  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:09):**  cover crops rather than actually having like mixtures of different tree crops within the  rows.  Yeah.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:14):**  So the rows, let's say the perennial is relatively mono, but in between the annuals that you  plant or it could be perennial long grasses and things like that as well.  But at least the machineries have to be able to enter.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:25):**  And also there I think there's an enormous development for lighter, much more selective.  I mean, we can't imagine what we're going to see in 10 years there and what then potentially  is possible in terms of mixing because the machinery recognizes which tree it should  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:37):**  actually harvest and which one it shouldn't.  Or I mean, there's a whole world there to discover, but most of it is not there yet.  So you cannot really, you cannot sell a fund on that at the moment, of course.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:46):**  No, but I think actually that technology is starting to appear.  We're seeing examples in different production systems, whether it's pheromone based systems  for trapping, suppressing harmful insects.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:18:58):**  We're seeing simple kind of camera assisted weeding machines which go between the rows  and know when it's a tree and know when it's a weed and can cut and not cut.  So I think we will see increasing these sort of simple robotics you could call it or simple  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:13):**  technologically enabled systems for, again, as I said before, replacing chemicals with  more mechanical vegetation control, which I think will address some of the big issues  in chemical use.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:22):**  And I think probably the next step beyond that, I've talked about cover crops, we've  talked about biological fertility, integrated pest management.  Probably the next step beyond that is then actually going fully organic, organic certified  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:32):**  systems.  So that's going to be a big focus of what we do in Europe now.  Again, huge market demand, massive premiums being paid at the moment.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:38):**  Organic almonds sell for literally twice the price as conventional.  Organic olives are probably more like 25, 30% premium, but there's very strong premiums  to these crops.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:46):**  And I think if you can harness those practices, fully eliminate the synthetic fertilizers and  chemicals, then I think it opens up some really interesting marketing opportunities for growers  because consumers are willing to pay for them.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:19:59):**  And do you see this fund or this investment thesis as a sort of potential transition as  well?  Let's say in 10 years, the robotics exist, or maybe there are slightly more hands available,  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:09):**  or there's a lot more research showing that also more diverse on the perennial side, so  more diverse orchards are differently managed, but easily manageable with certain new technologies  and machinery.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:21):**  But you already anyway got rid of all the chemical fertilizer and all the chemical inputs.  So these orchards can transition relatively easily to more diverse orchard itself over  time if that turned out to be possible.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:34):**  At the moment, it's way better to go from a very, let's say, input heavy, chemical heavy  orchard to an organic one, even though maybe from an ideal forestry perspective, that's  not the ideal yet, but that's the best we currently can do for the markets in terms  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:46):**  of the constraints, which are hands, labor, scale, et cetera.  Do you see this as, this is not done.  I'm imagining you can potentially in 10 years, we'll design an orchard even more diverse  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:20:56):**  and different if we get there with the technology and et cetera.  Yeah, I think there's also like zooming out maybe a level, there's definitely a landscape  approach.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:04):**  Like whenever you look at a property in Spain or Portugal, there will be an area of maybe  highly productive ground, which is where you'd love to plant and grow your high value orchard  crops.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:13):**  But almost certainly there's going to be 10, 20, 50% maybe of non-productive ground, which  maybe isn't irrigated or is in hillsides.  It's quite different and naturally where you can put the focus on biodiversity and conservation  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:27):**  and other goals.  So there's also a big part of what we'll be doing is how do you make the best possible  use of the bits in between or the bits around the productive hectares and achieve the best  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:37):**  outcomes for biodiversity, but also carbon sequestration, but also some of those integrated  pest management benefits as well.  If you have a healthy function ecosystem, that is going to have a positive knock on  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:45):**  effects on the orchards too, by controlling your pest and disease.  Yeah, I think that landscape approach is very interesting.  I mean, there are a few zooming out of that.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:21:55):**  I mean, we keep hearing it more and more maybe because we're in this little bubble, but definitely  Common Land is working on that, the WWF, or they just spun out actually the sustainable,  what is the landscape finance lab.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:06):**  We had Paul Chatterton definitely do for a check-in and we've been focusing on that technology  question as well, or that question of what to plant where and why in a landscape and  what, how good software, et cetera, help with that.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:16):**  And we've been recording a series on that, which I'll put a link below as well, but there  are very few, but it doesn't, yeah, many places it makes sense to do certain things or it  doesn't, but it goes beyond the confinement of your, your farm.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:27):**  And you would love of course, that the full landscape is moving in a certain direction  and not moving backwards.  So you get all kinds of runoff from your neighbors or drifts from all kinds of pesticides and  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:35):**  things you really don't want coming in.  So you would like your neighbors to move in the same direction.  Has that been difficult to find?  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:41):**  Is that, is that, or what do you see in Spain and Portugal in terms of, let's say moving  together?  Yeah, I think under there are some examples of great cooperatives working together, trying  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:49):**  to affect landscape change.  You mentioned common lands, for example, the project which they're working in the Southeast  Spain, Alvalau is a really good example of that where they brought together dozens of  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:22:59):**  producers and farmers and, and, you know, implementing regenerative systems for organic  rain fed animals and pistachios.  They've also built their own processing capabilities, their own brand, and I think it's working  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:10):**  very, very well.  But I think there are examples of that.  And I think also for us, like we, we also see within, even within a single property  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:16):**  boundary, you can actually achieve some of the same results.  You know, so for example, we're looking at a property in the Southeast Spain at the moment,  it's about a thousand hectares in total.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:25):**  Of that, about 500 hectares will be suitable for growing rain fed organic animals and pistachios.  But the other 500 hectares is really non arable, non productive land, which is hill size, which  is, you know, could be riparian areas.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:37):**  And so how do you design and manage those 500 hectares within the property boundaries  to still have those positive impacts on biodiversity and carbon and some of the positive spillover  effects for productive land.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:46):**  So I think that's one of the advantages working those countries, which have a bit more scale  where properties are larger, is that you get some of the landscape benefits within your  own property.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:23:56):**  Yeah.  And then those 500, are you looking at, I don't know, are you supporting the farmer  and doing things there as well from the mushrooms to the honey to the grazing maybe, or is it  
**[0:24:06-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:06):**  really okay?  Do you manage it for biodiversity and that's the impact?  Or are you looking at smaller niche things or maybe you not specifically as a fund, but  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:14):**  the operators you work with to somehow use between brackets that other piece as well  for food production?  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:21):**  So honey is one thing for sure.  I think there's some potential there.  We're looking at looking at actually aromatics and medicinal herbs, planting those sometimes  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:33):**  between rows or around orchards.  We've seen some potential there.  I think then carbon, as you're looking to restore forestry and shrub land for real  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:42):**  carbon benefits, I think there are some interesting projects like that.  There's potential payments available from corporates who want to offset emissions and  there are some interesting opportunities for tree planting and to really, with these wood  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:24:55):**  having probably more heavily forested hillsides, if you go back a few hundred years ago, they've  been cleared and degraded and probably overgrazed and poorly grazed.  So I think we do see some opportunities to reestablish forests there, not so much for  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:07):**  commercial purposes, but more for carbon biodiversity purposes.  And so you're in the phase now of buying some of these properties this week and maybe when  this is out that that already happened.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:18):**  Let's keep our fingers crossed.  Where do you see this going?  How long is the fund?  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:22):**  How long is the approach?  What are you looking at in terms of time?  Because of course, with the tree crops and permanent orchard timing is always longer  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:29):**  than the arable ones.  You're doing the organic grain you're doing in the US.  What's your thinking on timing as it comes back time and time again in this podcast?  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:37):**  Yeah, no, something we've thought a lot about because in many ways these are permanent assets.  They keep going.  They don't have a finite life.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:44):**  That's why I sell.  Yeah, but I think we've also got feedback from investors who say that they quite like  the discipline of a fixed term fund because it gives them the option to get out if they  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:25:54):**  want.  It provides managers with incentive, let's say, to really improve and make things work  up to a certain point.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:01):**  I think our funds so far have all been fixed term funds with a 10 to 14 year term.  This new fund will be similar.  It will have a 10 to 14 year term.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:09):**  So there will be an exit.  Now what is that exit?  I think it's not as if all the properties of farms or forests are broken up and sold.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:17):**  I think probably the most likely exit is-  Yeah, because I can imagine that that might be the fear of a farmer.  Let's say I'm a farmer in central Spain or in Portugal.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:24):**  I partner with you.  I buy the neighbor or the neighbors together.  We start on this great journey and then in 10 years you come knocking and say, I'm sorry,  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:33):**  but the time is up.  We have to sell and who knows what's going to happen to that land.  How do you prevent that from happening?  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:39):**  Because I can imagine that would be a fear for some of the partners you work with.  Yeah.  So I think it's consistent with what the most likely exit is, which is you're selling a  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:47):**  well-developed portfolio of farming and forestry assets, which are hopefully by then generating  a good cash yield.  So we think there's going to be a lot of investor interest in that.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:26:57):**  And so it wouldn't make sense to break up those portfolios, to kick off the farmers,  because what's making it work is the presence of those farmers, those local partners on  the ground.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:05):**  So you'd be shooting yourselves in the foot to go down that road.  So I think if things are working well, that's part of our job really is to help convince  people that these assets really do work.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:15):**  They are profitable, they're good for the environment and they can keep going for another  10, 20 years.  And so most likely you keep the portfolio and you have another investors who come in  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:23):**  at that point, or maybe some of the investors in the existing fund are so happy with the  results that they want to stay in.  And at that point it is possible to have almost a conversion to a more permanent vehicle where  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:34):**  you give investors the option to get out if they want to get out and those who want to  stay in can stay in.  So I think it's keeping options open, but the key goal is building that portfolio well-managed,  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:44):**  income generating assets, delivering high impact.  And once you're at that point, I think there's a lot of different attractive options for  what you do next for the next 10 years and beyond.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:27:53):**  And do you see any route for the farmers to grow into that in a sense that they might  end up owning part of the land, all that land, or is that, are the assets so expensive that  that's prohibitive over the next 10, 14 years?  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:06):**  Yeah, I think it's something we're discussing with some of the farmers you work with, you  know, having, they would have a first offer, first right of offer effectively on the property.  So I think it can be a ladder to land ownership for them.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:15):**  I think we're also realistic too.  You know, I think that, you know, farmers are businessmen and women and you know, that  there's a certain amount of their capital they want to invest in land, but they also  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:24):**  need capital for other things, you know, for machinery, for working capital, for.  And just to be clear, that's when we get into the operating model, but that's not what you're  offering.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:31):**  You're offering capital for the land.  Primarily, and the trees, you know, and the development of the land.  So I think we found good operating teams, farmers and companies you work with, you know,  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:42):**  they need capital for other purposes, you know, and that also be building processing  and going down the supply chain, you know, building markets as well.  So actually while some may want a certain amount of land, not all want all their capital  
**[0:28:53-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:28:53):**  in land, you know.  So I think that there is a natural synergy between long-term investors, you know, who  have a lower cost of capital and are willing to invest in land and trees and biological  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:01):**  assets and then the operators who can come and operate that and designing the arrangements  the appropriate way.  It's probably the, probably what, one of the aspects of this new fund where we are most  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:11):**  excited about as well is that operating model, you know, something we spent a lot of time  thinking through over the last 10 years and we've seen a lot of people try different operating  models.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:21):**  You know, on the one hand you have a sort of people who want to buy and operate, buy  land, hire people and try and capture all the profits.  Which you've been doing in Australia basically.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:30):**  Which you've done to a certain extent in Australia.  We build teams, we're running those crazy property sales.  We know all the, what it takes, all the good and the bad and the challenges with that.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:38):**  And so in the theories that captures the full profits of the system, you know, for the investor.  And then on the other end of the spectrum we've seen quite passive buying lease models  where a lot of money just into buying farmland, leasing out an annual one, two, three year  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:29:52):**  leases to farmers where there's really no input on what happens on the land.  And that can be, we think a little bit too passive.  What we find is, we think there's an opportunity for more of a partnership model with local  
**[0:30:03-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:03):**  operators which is what we've been doing in Spain and Portugal.  So we've been finding great local operators.  They could be individual farmers.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:10):**  Quite often they're small, medium sized enterprises, companies.  They might be specialists in organic olives or in regenerative almonds or pistachios.  And they may have a certain amount of land which they own and manage.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:21):**  They may have invested in processing and they may be developing brands and marketing capabilities  downstream.  They want to grow, they want to scale.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:28):**  They don't have the capital to invest in that land.  Neither do they necessarily want to invest in that land because their cost of capital  is higher.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:34):**  Or a private equity of business costs of capital.  So there's a natural synergy where we, our fund can come in, work with these operators  to find the right kind of land.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:42):**  We invest in it.  We provide capital for planting new trees, for organic conversion, whatever is happening  on develop the land.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:49):**  And then the operators come in and operate day to day.  They're in charge, they're responsible.  But we both fund the operating expenses.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:30:56):**  So we're sharing operating expenses as well.  And then we're sharing revenue or profit between the investor and the operator.  So it's sort of a bespoke hybrid model we developed.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:06):**  But it's got a very good reception among some of these great innovative, I'd say, ecological  operators in Spain and Portugal.  And yeah, we're quite excited about that.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:13):**  We think it's a real way we can scale.  And the bigger picture I think is really understanding what's the role of capital.  And capital not maybe overstepping its boundaries.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:22):**  We see some investors maybe a little bit too greedy because they see the numbers in the  spreadsheet and they think, oh, why don't I capture the full returns from organic animals  or organic olives and I'll just hire people and capture all those profits.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:34):**  But the reality is quite different.  It looks good in the spreadsheet, but as you try and do it, often it doesn't work.  And that's partly because you need the local operators, the most important person.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:43):**  And that person must have aligned incentives.  And if they're just an employee, if they're just a hired gun, then you don't always get  the best attention and you don't always get the right alignment.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:31:55):**  So we think these operating partnerships are the way to go because you're getting the best  teams that have the local knowledge equities and you're aligning your incentives with those  the investors will own.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:05):**  And how did you find them in Spain and Portugal?  Is that going around?  Is that having a lot of coffees?  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:11):**  Is that getting in a car and visiting many of these?  How did you how do you build that up?  Yeah, a lot of coffee.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:16):**  Good to me in Spain and Portugal.  Lots of good wine too.  So it makes it quite an enjoyable experience.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:21):**  Yeah, so it's networking referrals.  We've hired an agronomist in Portugal.  Fijaro Zero has joined our team, he's in Lisbon.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:29):**  So he's got an amazing network in Portugal already and in Spain too.  And then we've been doing our own work.  And then we've come in through networks, whether it's regenerative agriculture networks or maybe  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:38):**  some organic olive oil producer networks or different entry points, let's say, to start  talking to people and explain what we do.  Yeah, and we found probably six or seven different groups now that sort of fit the bill.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:48):**  And I think we'll find more as we go along.  Is that a model that you could see growing beyond that?  Why do you see maybe it's a difficult question, but why you see others not applying that?  
**[0:32:59-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:32:59):**  And maybe you meant the greedy part.  But I think then people notice very quickly that the spreadsheet is very different from  reality.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:05):**  And do they then abandon that?  Or do you see that as a risk as well?  Many questions.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:10):**  Let's say, do you see this going beyond Spain and Portugal, and others copying this or also  applying this method?  Because of course, it's not a it's not a there's no patent on it.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:18):**  But it makes a lot of sense, because it's so context specific.  Yeah, so I think the first question, absolutely, we see it going beyond Spain and Portugal,  we're actually working on a similar strategy in the US at the moment, the west coast of  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:31):**  the US looking at California, Washington, Oregon area, where we see some opportunities  there around permanent specialty crops, especially organic certified.  And we have also found some great local operators there.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:42):**  And we see a similar potential, you know, for investors to come in and provide capital  for land acquisition and tree establishment and organic conversion and we can enter into  probably more like long term leases, but very flexible terms where the investor is really  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:33:55):**  sharing some of that risk with the farmer, and then sharing some of the upside to you  know, post organic conversion, post conversion to more general systems.  So I think there's definitely potential all over the world, wherever agriculture is practiced  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:06):**  in a commercial way.  Risk of other copying?  Well, we hope everyone does copy.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:10):**  I think you know, I think it's a good model.  So I think it's, I think it's what the sector needs, you know, is capital playing its right  full role, you know, not getting too greedy, not overstepping its bounds, you know, knowing  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:20):**  when to leave the local operators really much in charge in the driving seat, and being supportive  of those local operators who it all comes back to those farmers, foresters who have  that ecological knowledge and local knowledge, you know, and how do we empower them and support  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:32):**  them and help them help them grow.  So yeah, I hope more people, you know, try this approaches.  And because we have had, I think, a wave of investments previously, I don't remember exactly  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:42):**  when, but it was a wave of interest in farmland and forestry, and many institutional investors  wouldn't say got burned, but there was a lot of discussion on the non ecological approaches,  the land grabbing land titles, and many, maybe they took a step back and said, Okay, for  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:34:56):**  now, I won't touch these sectors you see now, or you mentioned, there's definitely a new  interest.  Do you have to explain very often that this is very fundamentally different than some  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:05):**  of the let's buy and build an enormous plantation somewhere very far away, and let's operate  it and bring in everything?  Like, is that stigma still sort of there?  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:12):**  Or what do you see in terms in the institutional investors that obviously, very different from  a family that's investing, they have to go through all kinds of hoops, jump through everything  and cover many things and take many boxes, rightfully so, because they're investing our  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:24):**  pension money.  But do you see that it's still difficult to sell quote unquote, agriculture, land and  forestry?  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:31):**  Or is it is that has that changed over the last years?  Yeah, well, I think the local context is very important, you know, so we wouldn't attempt  our model in Sub Saharan Africa, for example, you know, or many parts of the emerging world,  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:43):**  because I think, you know, in countries where 75% of people earn their livelihoods from  agriculture from the land, you know, the idea of sort of coming in and trying to push people  off land and build up these giant holdings, I think it is very problematic, actually.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:35:56):**  You know, I think we're operating in Europe and North America and Australia, where actually  the opposite is the case where people have left the land and land has been almost abandoned  and neglected.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:05):**  And everyone's moved to the towns and the cities and the average age of farmers is 60  plus.  So there's actually been this great exodus, you know, and so there I think, you know,  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:14):**  I think there are opportunities to come in for capital to play this sort of longer term,  almost capitalistic role of pushing some of these systems in a better direction and helping  these more innovative, often younger farmers expand.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:25):**  You know, that's the other thing, the people, the farmers who work in America, for example,  the average age is probably more like mid 30s.  You know, so we're working at farmers who are significantly lower than the average,  
**[0:36:35-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:35):**  maybe half.  Yeah.  And their challenge, how do they get access to land?  
**[0:36:38-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:38):**  Because land is expensive.  It's, you know, held up, tied up in trust and different kinds of structures.  A lot of it has been leased or has been, it's not been owner occupied anyway, but it's still  
**[0:36:48-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:48):**  very hard for them to get that access so we can help.  So I think it's locally contextually appropriate.  And I think in those economies where the center of attention and most jobs have shifted away  
**[0:36:59-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:36:59):**  from agriculture, away from rural areas.  And I think we feel much more comfortable about playing that role of being a catalytic  investor.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:07):**  It's very interesting that the land ownership discussion, which comes back time and time  again and then the reality hits in, of course, that many young farmers that want to move  into the space simply cannot get access to land unless you're born into it or you have  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:19):**  a very interesting bank account or you borrow a lot of money and you're pushed into, if  you even can, pushed into an agriculture system that has to serve that money you borrowed  from a bank against terms that are not very flexible as the land could offer.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:32):**  So it's a very, it's an interesting philosophical discussion about land ownership and should  that be privatized or not, et cetera, et cetera.  But it's also a very practical one that many who want to farm don't have access to enough  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:42):**  land to farm or even any land to farm and are stuck in the system and could probably  farm for the next 30, 40 years and provide a lot of very interesting food to us if they  could get access to that.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:37:53):**  So it's one to keep coming back to and check reality with, obviously.  And some questions I always like to ask, but I didn't get five years ago because it was  a very different podcast.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:04):**  Where are you contrarian?  What do you believe to be true about regen ag and forestry?  Let's add it here as well that others don't believe to be true.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:10):**  This is definitely inspired by John Kempf, who does a very interesting, very deep podcast  on soil and everything.  But where are you contrarian in terms of, I mean, you already mentioned the focus on  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:19):**  orchard is you said it's been a bit neglected in the space, but where else if you go to  conferences, which I know you do a lot or did a lot now virtually, where do you see  yourself that you think fundamentally different than many in the space?  
**[0:38:31-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:31):**  Yeah, I would say one is a belief that these regenerative management systems, which have  these positive environmental impacts, can be consistent with your highly commercial  and also scalable operations.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:46):**  You know that it is an all one hectare farm forestry.  You can have large scale commercial operations, which are producing good volumes of healthy  nutritious food or good quality timber from a forest and are still managed in these ecological  
**[0:38:59-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:38:59):**  ways.  And not only is it possible, it's probably a necessity because the realities are, as  I said, labor is scarce.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:05):**  People don't want to work on the lands.  We need to find these more, you need to find efficient ways to manage land still.  So we're not trying to go back in time, we're really trying to go forward in time.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:14):**  These are the modern versions of ecological systems.  I mean, just one example of that, we see in the olive space, there's been a whole shift  ongoing in Spain and Portugal away from the more traditional olive orchards, where you  
**[0:39:28-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:28):**  have very low tree densities, maybe unirrigated, low input, but also actually very expensive  to manage and often quite unprofitable because you rely on actually hand pruning and actually  your manual harvesting or mechanized shakers.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:42):**  And it's actually quite inefficient and quite unprofitable.  A shift towards more, called super high density systems, where you're planting olive trees  as you in rows, which are density, almost more like hedgerows.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:39:54):**  And they developed these machines that come right over the top and harvest from the bushes  directly and can take those olives, harvest them quickly, get them to processing facilities  quickly and turn them into olive oil quickly too.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:06):**  And that, on the face, you think super high density doesn't sound very nice.  You think intensive, you think-  Sounds industrial.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:12):**  Yeah, sounds industrial.  This must be bad.  But if you actually dig in, you see that, so first in terms of olive oil quality, there's  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:18):**  been a huge increase in the quality of olive oil, the proportion of extra virgin olive  oil, for example, with low acidity in Portugal over the last 10 years.  And that's because of the shift from these traditional to super high density systems.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:29):**  The reason being that you can get this much quicker harvest and you can get the olives  through the processing within 24 hours.  And that's really the key factor of olive oil quality is actually just the efficiency.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:39):**  And speed from tree to mill, basically, that's the-  Yeah, from ripeness to harvesting to mill to processing.  If you can do all that within 24 hours, you will get a high quality olive oil.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:40:51):**  So we're actually seeing higher quality oils coming out of the systems.  Second in terms of the impacts, there have been some issues with night harvesting, having  a detrimental impact on nesting birds.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:01):**  I think that needs to go away.  But once you take that away, there's been some very interesting research on the carbon  benefits of super high density olives, where actually these systems store a huge amount  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:10):**  more carbon per hectare than the more traditional systems.  Partly getting a lot more biomass growth, getting a lot more pruning and residues, and  they are reincorporated into the ground, either directly or through composting.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:21):**  And you can get some quite spectacular increases in soil as well as above ground carbon.  So in terms of for carbon and climate, these intensive orchards are actually far superior.  And then I think the third, we are seeing some operators in Spain and Portugal who are  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:33):**  able to manage the orchards in fully organic ways.  So they take out all the synthetic fertilizers and all the pesticides and are achieving very  high organic yields.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:42):**  So for us, that's a kind of a holy grail where you have an intensive, highly productive,  high yielding system, managed organically, very, very good for carbon and very good for  quality, let's say, of products.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:41:53):**  So I think that's what we've got to keep looking for, these modern regenerative ag  systems, not going back in time to what it was 100 years ago.  So that's one thing that we believe in.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:03):**  I think we think that that's where, yeah, what's the direction of travel we need to  go in.  And in terms of quality, you mentioned the Evo, obviously, and in terms of, say, the  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:12):**  nutrient density or the measurement of the quality of the olive oil, what have you seen  there or is that still very early?  Because many say older trees give well managed, obviously, give X, Y, Z and compared to younger  
**[0:42:23-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:23):**  ones or younger systems.  Do you see there or is that simply, let's say, quality is Evo and that's what we're  looking at?  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:30):**  Yeah.  And some of the best olive oil in the world will come from these more traditional systems.  So what we see is just huge variety in quality.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:38):**  So you have some extraordinary high quality olive oil that's coming from some of these  orchards, but also a lot of quite poor olive oil too.  So what these more modern systems do is...  
**[0:42:46-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:46):**  And these orchards are being abandoned at the moment, right?  Yeah.  In many cases, huge issues with disease, Xylallofasciatiosis, actually attacking traditional orchards more.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:42:55):**  Yeah.  How is the disease pressure then on these high intensive ones?  As the trees are, I mean, for my non extreme knowledge, like the trees are closer to each  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:03):**  other, so one gets sick, everything gets sick or is that too easy or they use different  varieties or stronger trees or something?  Well, I think a lot of it is the health of the tree.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:12):**  So a healthy tree is more resistant to pests and diseases.  And if you are supplying the right fertility, the trees are getting the right amount of  water and they're being pruned in the right way, then yeah, you can have quite healthy,  
**[0:43:24-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:24):**  vigorous trees.  So that's probably the greatest protection you can get for some of these pests and diseases  and things like the Xylallofasciatiosis, this new disease has been coming in and sweeping  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:32):**  through all of orchards in Italy, has been primarily affecting unfortunately old traditional  orchards.  It's been in Puglia, that's where the problem has been, not so much the actually more modern,  
**[0:43:41-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:41):**  well run, let's say, intensive orchards.  So that's just in terms of contrarianism, just we don't want to forsake the efficiencies  by going regenerative and we think it is possible.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:43:49):**  I think the other one is, again, probably the operating model that we talked about before,  like how do we find, how do we work with the best possible operators on the ground and  design the right structures which are going to bring them on board and incentivize them  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:01):**  and align their incentives with those of our investors.  That's something we think is really, really important and getting away from that spreadsheet  agriculture to these partnerships on the ground, that's another, I think, big, big focus here  
**[0:44:12-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:12):**  for us at the moment.  And maybe just a final one, if you want one more, I'd say, actually investing in Europe,  in itself the idea of investing in natural assets in Europe is a bit contrarian because  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:25):**  most of the investments going to the US or Australia, Latin America, people think Europe  is fragmented or old or expensive and it can be all those things, but we think there's  also some really interesting opportunities, both in forestry in certain countries and  
**[0:44:38-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:38):**  then in Spain and Portugal and the orchard side.  So yeah, I think you get some good appropriate returns with all the low risk that comes from  investing in the Eurozone as well.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:44:49):**  And if you could change one thing, so you had a magic wand that gave you magic power  in the food and agriculture or the forestry space or in general, it could be global consciousness  or like I keep saying better taste or et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:01):**  What would you do if you had that magic power over overnight and you could only one, in  this case, only one, only one thing could be changed in the impact investing or agriculture  and forestry space?  
**[0:45:11-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:11):**  I still think a lot more work is needed to allow us to generate and sell carbon offsets,  you know, from land based projects, particularly, strange enough, in places like Europe where  you can get into funny issues around double accounting and what people can trade and use.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:28):**  It's ironically easier for corporates to buy like a credit somewhere or EDD forestry project  in Asia or South America.  It is actually to invest in forestry or agriculture projects in Europe, you know, because of the  
**[0:45:41-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:41):**  way carbon accounting rules are set up.  So I think there's a lack of clarity there and I think you're having a clear, consistent  set of rules around what qualifies as stored carbon and how producers can get compensated  
**[0:45:54-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:45:54):**  and rewarded for doing that, for increasing that.  I really think that could be a massive booster of some of these systems.  We've all been talking about it for 10 years, but we're still not quite there.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:05):**  So hopefully the next 10 years, some of those schemes will get clarified and come more into  view and be more practical for producers on the ground.  Yeah, I think there's a lot of talk and I hope some of that will be transferred into  
**[0:46:18-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:18):**  practical tools for the operators and farmers on the ground and the people partnering with  them like yourself.  And not necessarily, I see a company popping up probably every other week that promises  
**[0:46:27-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:27):**  all kinds of soil carbon credits and tree credits, et cetera.  But I also get the feeling that a lot of cowboys getting in because they see the excitement  for the word soil carbon and tree carbon in the same sentence.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:39):**  So it's going to be a rough ride, I think, for over the next years, because a lot of  these things are looking amazing on Spreadsheet and very easy on Spreadsheet.  And when it comes down to actually verifying, measuring and selling these things and making  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:46:51):**  sure they keep they stay in the ground and in the tree, it's the reality is slightly  different and more difficult and not absolutely necessary.  And we have to figure it out, but it's not so easy.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:02):**  So let's see that we will keep following that, obviously, with the podcast.  I completely agree.  We need clarity and we need bigger markets there and more flow because not enough flows  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:10):**  to the to the operators and the farmers and the landowners that are doing this work in  many cases, like you said, for decades.  And maybe even have to be compensated for that.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:18):**  And not the ones that have been, let's say, the free rider problem is an issue here.  The ones that have been performing the worst and are now planting the trees might get the  biggest the biggest payout, which is not really what we want.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:29):**  I think we want to also support the ones that have been on this for many decades.  Yeah, for sure.  So I don't want to keep any more of your time.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:37):**  I want to be conscious of it as well.  And thank you so much for sharing and this check in.  Let's make sure we don't do the next one after five years, but a bit earlier.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:47:44):**  Thanks, it's been a pleasure.  Yeah, great to catch up.  And yeah, we followed your podcast series of great interest the last five years.

**[0:48:32-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:48:32):**  Thank you so much and see you at the next podcast.  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:48:50-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:48:50):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:49:00-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:49:00):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:49:12-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:49:12):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:49:20-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:49:20):**  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:49:23):**  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  
**[0:49:29-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:49:29):**  For whom is this course?  The soil builders and investors in the space.  The soil builders, people working in the space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle  
**[0:49:38-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:49:38):**  builders, crowd investing, platform builders, agtech companies, farm to gut food companies,  permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:49:50):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:02):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:07):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:50:22-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:22):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:50:26-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:26):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:50:40-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:40):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:50:52):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:51:05):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:51:11):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-mcmahon-2#t=0:51:21):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on  the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

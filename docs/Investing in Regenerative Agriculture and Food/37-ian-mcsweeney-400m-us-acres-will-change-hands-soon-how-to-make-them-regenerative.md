**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:14):**  You'll be listening to an interview with Ian where we talk about land ownership and land  
**[0:00:17-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:17):**  ownership transition.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:18):**  The way that land ownership transitions is absolutely key to the future of agriculture  
**[0:00:24-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:24):**  and thus the planet.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:25):**  Done well, it could give the next generation of regenerative farmers access to land under  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:29):**  the circumstances which pushes them to be even more regenerative.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:32):**  But done wrong, it could force the next generation of farmers to destroy even more soil against  
**[0:00:38-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:38):**  their will.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:39):**  I hope you enjoy it.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:45):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:49-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:49):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:50):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:54):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:00):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:05):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:07):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:11):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:13):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:18):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:23):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:27):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:30):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:34):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:39):**  depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:43):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:00):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:03):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:05):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:08):**  I'm Koonvassai, your host.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:09):**  And today I'm talking to Ian McSweeney, the director of the Agrarian Trust.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:13):**  The Agrarian Trust mission is to support land access for the next generation of farmers,  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:18):**  supporting all stakeholders from farmers and community members to activists and investors  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:23):**  in this absolutely key process.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:25):**  This last bit I added myself.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:27):**  Welcome Ian.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:28):**  Thank you, Koonvassai.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:29):**  Thank you for having me on.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:30):**  I look forward to our conversation.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:32):**  And to start that conversation with a personal question, what brings you to the Agrarian  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:37):**  Trust, what brings you to soil and food and delegating your career basically to that?  
**[0:02:43-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:43):**  Yeah, I have always had a real desire to work with and help people through their life journey.  
**[0:02:52-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:52):**  And that early on manifest in me working as social worker and helping people kind of solve  
**[0:03:01-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:01):**  life's problems and manage their kind of struggles.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:08):**  So I did that for a number of years but I kind of didn't see the long term impact and  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:15):**  connection that I was hoping for and the people I was working with and really have personally  
**[0:03:21-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:21):**  always been connected to land and food myself and have strong childhood memories and now  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:29):**  have young children myself and I'm raising them connected to the land.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:33):**  So really saw the connection people have to land for one reason or another, memories,  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:42):**  direct connection in their work with land.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:45):**  So really thought that how can I work with people in their life journey as it relates  
**[0:03:51-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:51):**  to land.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:52):**  And so left social work, got into real estate and planning and did that for a number of  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:59):**  years, founded a real estate company that connected development in a way that was sensitive  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:04:06):**  and prioritized agriculture and community building.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:04:11):**  So worked doing that, did a number of kind of planned community projects that conserved  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:04:17):**  land, brought about active agriculture and built community.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:04:22):**  And in doing that and running that business, opportunity came up to run a private foundation,  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:04:30):**  the Russell Foundation.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:04:32):**  So I transitioned into the world of philanthropy and operated the Russell Foundation for a  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:04:40):**  dozen years.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:04:42):**  Russell Foundation's focus was land conservation in general with a priority towards agriculture  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:04:50):**  and people's connection to food and farmland.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:04:56):**  So that kind of allowed me to really live into that work and explore ways that I could  
**[0:05:03-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:05:03):**  innovate what existed around farmland conservation work and kind of community engagement with  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:05:10):**  agriculture.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:05:12):**  So that's been where I've been the last dozen years and it's given me a great foundation  
**[0:05:19-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:05:19):**  of work, experience and networking with others and kind of many kind of different types of  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:05:28):**  land-based projects.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:05:31):**  So from that, I was able to kind of build upon that work and move into present work,  
**[0:05:40-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:05:40):**  leading Agrarian Trust which is a newer agricultural focus national land trust that we can talk  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:05:49):**  more about.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:05:50):**  But Agrarian Trust's focus is really to innovate how we hold land and how we bring together  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:05:59):**  people and money to make that possible, all to address the transfer of land that's going  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:06):**  on presently in this country.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:08):**  To just give a bit of context, how much, because on your website you stated immediately, it's  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:14):**  predicted that 400 million acres of US farmland will change hands in the next two decades.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:20):**  That sounds like a lot, but just to put it in context, what is the percentage of, why  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:26):**  is it such an important issue at the moment?  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:28):**  Why we should all and hopefully all the impact investors that are listening care about the  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:34):**  land changing hands over the next decade?  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:36):**  Why is it key to many of the issues that you've been working on for life?  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:41):**  Yeah, so that is a lot of land.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:43):**  The average age of a farmland owner in the States is a little over 65 years old.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:50):**  It sounds like pension age.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:52):**  So because of that, a lot of people are needing to or being forced to transfer farmland they've  
**[0:06:59-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:59):**  owned for generations.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:01):**  So that 400 million acres is more acreage than all the national parks and other federally  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:08):**  owned land in this country.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:10):**  So our work as a nation here to build a collective national parks for common benefit and kind  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:22):**  of a great pride that our country has has happened over quite a bit of time.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:29):**  And we've built upon that and continue to build upon that.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:32):**  But we're now faced with a situation where more acreage than we have accumulated in public  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:40):**  trust through federal and private and state ownership in parkland is going to transfer  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:46):**  in the farmland.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:47):**  So that's significant amount of farmland that is transferring now.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:52):**  And really it's different parts of the country have different drivers for why that land is  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:59):**  transferring.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:08:01):**  A lot of it is falling out of small scale family run food producing farms that are focused  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:08:11):**  on soil ecosystem and community health.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:08:15):**  So that is being lost at a significant rate as farmland is being converted for development,  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:08:24):**  for other extractive uses.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:08:29):**  It's being bought up and aggregated by larger agricultural companies and investment houses.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:08:41):**  So and then run more as commodity agriculture.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:08:46):**  Land is also going fallow as well in certain parts as certain parts of our country are  
**[0:08:52-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:08:52):**  depopulated of people as much of that can be attributed to kind of urban job opportunities  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:03):**  and pulling people out of country and lack of agricultural and land-based opportunities  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:10):**  in rural parts of the country.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:11):**  But as places get depopulated, land is also going fallow as well.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:17):**  So there's a lot of factors that are kind of moving this transition away from sustainable  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:26):**  and regenerative small scale food production agriculture.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:30):**  And it's significant.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:31):**  So we need multiple tools to really address it.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:35):**  And what are a few examples of those tools that you just mentioned?  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:41):**  What can we do or what are things that the agrarian trust is currently working on?  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:46):**  You became the director two or three months ago.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:49):**  But what is the most urgent thing you're working on at the moment in this huge transition?  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:55):**  And this is so many acres, we can hardly imagine it, but what's the first step?  
**[0:10:01-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:10:01):**  Yeah, well, so that in the States, there's really a large community of conservation organizations  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:10:11):**  that have long been protecting natural resources for public benefit.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:10:17):**  So that's come the private movement in conservation organizations coming out of kind of the public  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:10:25):**  work around national parks.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:10:29):**  So we have a good and healthy community that is protecting natural resources, but that  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:10:37):**  community, the land trust, state, federal organizations and entities doing that work  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:10:44):**  are focused on protection of the land, really not as much on who owns it and how we deal  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:10:51):**  with that transfer of land that has been left really for private ownership.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:10:58):**  And there's a real impulse in the States for private individual property rights and ownership  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:11:04):**  that's driven that.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:11:06):**  We at Agrarian Trust see the need for an alternative to that, a need to collaborate with the conservation  
**[0:11:13-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:11:13):**  organizations that are protecting the natural resources, but really a need to address who  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:11:21):**  owns the land and how it is owned.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:11:23):**  So we, Agrarian Trust, see work of community land trusts who have long worked in the States  
**[0:11:33-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:11:33):**  as well, but they're more focused on social endeavors.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:11:40):**  Affordable housing would be one.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:11:42):**  So they own land for affordable housing and for other social community-based needs, not  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:11:50):**  as much for agriculture though.  
**[0:11:53-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:11:53):**  So we see kind of how can we look at the best of what conservation land trusts and organizations  
**[0:12:01-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:12:01):**  and community land trusts and cooperatives and housing do and bring those together in  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:12:10):**  a way that looks at who owns the land, who owns the actual fee interest in the land.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:12:16):**  So we, Agrarian Trust, are setting up entities, localized farm commons entities, 501C2 structure,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:12:28):**  non-profit to own land for the benefit of communities.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:12:32):**  So it would partner with the conservation and community groups to bring about ownership  
**[0:12:41-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:12:41):**  of farmland by these farm commons entities, removing the land from the commodity marketplace  
**[0:12:50-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:12:50):**  and holding the land in a long-term relationship with farmers who will have tenure, 99-year  
**[0:13:00-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:13:00):**  lease and equity arrangements on the land where they will have access and autonomous  
**[0:13:07-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:13:07):**  control to operate on the ground and Agrarian Trust through these farm commons entities  
**[0:13:15-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:13:15):**  and other organizations as well who are setting up these farm commons, these 501C2 land holding  
**[0:13:23-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:13:23):**  entities can own this land so they can work as a non-profit and raise money, both philanthropic  
**[0:13:30-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:13:30):**  dollars and investment dollars in to the farm commons 501C2 entity and that 501C2 farm commons  
**[0:13:39-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:13:39):**  entity can then own farmland and provide long-term lease out to farmers and other community enterprises.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:13:48):**  And we really feel that there's a need to address the ownership and how you kind of  
**[0:13:56-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:13:56):**  remove the value from that land, that farmland in this country has appreciated quite significantly  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:14:07):**  over the last few decades.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:14:09):**  So many farms that I work with who may have started in the 1980s, 1990s have seen their  
**[0:14:19-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:14:19):**  value, the farmland, the acre value of their land go up by thousands of percent over time.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:14:28):**  So the appreciation of that farmland is significant and it's created a present value where it  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:14:37):**  is unaffordable for next generation farmers to come on.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:14:42):**  It's unaffordable to afford that land debt on the revenue of a farm enterprise.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:14:50):**  So we need to find a way to extract the appreciated value of that farmland and bring it into this  
**[0:14:57-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:14:57):**  ownership that will remove future sales and remove speculative appreciation of land values  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:08):**  and set affordable long-term lease rates for that.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:12):**  So I have a lot of questions to unpack there.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:15):**  First of all, you mentioned it now as well, like the current value of the land, like the  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:20):**  current price you pay on the market is no longer connected to what the land sustainably  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:27):**  or regeneratively can produce of it in terms of cashflow.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:32):**  And that created a huge disbalance and that's why it's so difficult for new generations  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:37):**  that are hopefully more regenerative to get into agriculture.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:41):**  That's one of the main...  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:42):**  Correct.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:43):**  But if that's the case and the prices of these lands and acres are so high, how do you take  
**[0:15:52-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:52):**  them off the market?  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:53):**  How are you able to buy them?  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:56):**  How are you paying the current prices and thus also maybe helping the market to sustain  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:00):**  itself, which is in itself maybe not a good thing.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:04):**  And if not the current prices, how do you make sure you, how are you acquiring this  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:09):**  land without paying the main, the big price that nobody else can afford at the moment?  
**[0:16:15-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:16):**  So a combination of ways.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:20):**  So many farmland in areas where there's high development pressures, there's many of the  
**[0:16:29-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:29):**  conservation land trusts that I mentioned who work in a lot of, mainly in kind of around  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:36):**  urban areas and on the east and west coast of this country is where they're centered.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:42):**  But there's a lot of conservation organizations that are, their work is to protect lands,  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:49):**  their resources.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:50):**  And they do that primarily through acquiring conservation easements on the land.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:57):**  The conservation easements permanently remove the development and extractive uses of that  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:05):**  land.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:07):**  And there's, there could always be more conservation land trusts.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:12):**  There could always be more dollars for conservation land trusts to do their work.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:18):**  But there's a robust community of conservation land trusts and there's a significant amount  
**[0:17:23-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:23):**  of federal, state, local, private dollars, philanthropic dollars to acquire those conservation  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:33):**  easements.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:35):**  And just to, for the international audience, how does an easement work in practice?  
**[0:17:42-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:42):**  Can you give a very simple example from one of the many farms you worked with?  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:49):**  Who pays who?  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:50):**  What does it mean?  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:52):**  And what does it, what does it mean for the sector?  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:55):**  Sure.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:57):**  So, so that easements on land are, are kind of giving a third party certain rights to  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:18:05):**  that land.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:18:06):**  So there are many easements that give affirmative rights, specifically like a, a municipality  
**[0:18:16-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:18:16):**  or a state will have easements on private property to have roads and to maintain roads  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:18:24):**  that in many cases they do not own the land a road sits on.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:18:29):**  They hold an easement across private property to maintain a road.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:18:34):**  The power companies do the same thing with their utility lines and connections.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:18:42):**  So there's easements that give affirmative rights in those ways that have long existed.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:18:48):**  There's also conservation easements and what they do is they take the, the rights of property.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:18:56):**  So in this country private property rights are, are held very closely by the individual  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:19:04):**  and they've long been a priority embedded in our culture.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:19:09):**  So the private property rights give someone who owns property the right to do a number  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:19:15):**  of things on their property subject to local and state zoning regulations.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:19:21):**  So an individual who owns private property can build homes, they could extract natural  
**[0:19:30-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:19:30):**  resources, they could farm, have forest management, they could have recreation or just enjoy the  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:19:41):**  property.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:19:42):**  What a conservation easement does is it removes certain rights.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:19:46):**  So those rights to build homes, residential homes, the right to build kind of commercial  
**[0:19:52-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:19:52):**  or industrial buildings, the rights to extract soil, oil, gas, minerals, those rights of  
**[0:20:02-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:02):**  the property are severed from private ownership and those rights are then held by some public  
**[0:20:11-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:11):**  entity, whether it is a federal government, state entities or these private nonprofits,  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:19):**  conservation land trusts.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:21):**  And there's other entities that may hold those rights as well.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:25):**  But these entities will hold the development rights and the extraction rights of property  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:33):**  and they will permanently hold those.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:35):**  And they pay for them?  
**[0:20:36-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:36):**  Yeah, and they'll pay for those.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:38):**  So they'll hold those...  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:39):**  To the farmer or to the owner.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:41):**  To the owner, right.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:42):**  So they're holding those permanently.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:44):**  So they're permanently extracting that ability of the private owner to exercise those rights  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:51):**  on the property.  
**[0:20:52-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:52):**  And so in that process, when that entity acquires those rights in the conservation easement,  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:21:00):**  there is a third party appraisal done that looks at the value of the property with all  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:21:06):**  the rights that exist and the value of the property without those rights.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:21:11):**  So what is the value of a parcel of land if it can no longer be developed for housing  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:21:19):**  or commercial uses and it can no longer extract natural resources from it?  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:21:26):**  It's a much lower value.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:21:28):**  And so for example, in urban areas that have significant development pressure on the rural  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:21:37):**  outskirts around those urban areas, so the Northeast, for example, where you're close  
**[0:21:43-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:21:43):**  to Boston, New York and the whole Northeast corridor there, that the conservation easement  
**[0:21:52-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:21:52):**  value is between kind of 60 and 80% of the total value of the raw land.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:22:02):**  So in urban areas in the middle of the country and then really the East and West coast of  
**[0:22:08-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:22:08):**  the country here, that if this work is done in partnership with a conservation land trust  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:22:16):**  or other conservation organization where they acquire the conservation easement and they're  
**[0:22:21-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:22:21):**  using a variety of grant and philanthropic funds, they're able to come up with and compensate  
**[0:22:29-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:22:29):**  private landowner for the vast majority of the value of the land through extracting those  
**[0:22:36-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:22:36):**  rights that really a farmer really never wants to exercise those rights anyways.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:22:45):**  They're trying to farm in the land, they're not trying to develop the land or sell off  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:22:50):**  the topsoil.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:22:51):**  So working with conservation organizations is a good way to buy down the value of the  
**[0:22:59-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:22:59):**  land and then kind of some landowners simply getting compensated for the conservation easement  
**[0:23:09-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:23:09):**  at that portion of the value of the raw land is enough for them to be compensated and exit  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:23:18):**  ownership in total.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:23:21):**  And retire.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:23:22):**  And retire, right.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:23:23):**  And think back to the great appreciation of the land.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:23:26):**  So many long time farmers, they have seen the land appreciate significantly so them  
**[0:23:33-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:23:33):**  getting 80% of the value of the raw land today is far more than they ever expected to or  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:23:42):**  need to retire on.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:23:44):**  So they're satisfied receiving those conservation easement proceeds and then donating or in  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:23:53):**  some cases where there might be a little more money needed, kind of providing a very significant  
**[0:23:58-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:23:58):**  discount sale on the land to then either next owner, private owner or what we agrarian trust  
**[0:24:08-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:24:08):**  are doing is then they could donate the land into a nonprofit, agrarian trust or to other  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:24:18):**  nonprofits that are working in that space.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:24:21):**  And in doing that, landowner has received enough compensation through the conservation  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:24:28):**  easement sale in donating the land to a nonprofit.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:24:32):**  There's tax benefits for them that can reduce the tax liability they have on the proceeds  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:24:40):**  of that easement sale and other income.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:24:43):**  So there's financial benefit for them to donate to a nonprofit as well.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:24:48):**  So that can work quite well is to partner with a conservation land trust, help them  
**[0:24:55-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:24:55):**  raise money to purchase the conservation easement and then that compensates private landowner,  
**[0:25:03-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:03):**  private landowner can exit and then land can transfer and next generation farmer can come  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:11):**  on at a much more affordable access point.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:15):**  And because that conservation easement is permanent, you've permanently removed that  
**[0:25:20-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:20):**  value from the land and by agrarian trust or other nonprofit owning the land, it can  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:28):**  permanently remove the remainder value as well.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:33):**  And then you need to find a young farmer or younger farmer to farm it in a regenerative  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:39):**  way because you also mentioned some of these easements are also forbidden to extract the  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:45):**  soil.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:46):**  So is it easy to find regenerative farmers that want to get on the land and are not extractive  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:52):**  soil?  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:53):**  Is that something you struggle with or is it really the access to land that is the main  
**[0:25:58-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:58):**  bottleneck here?  
**[0:25:59-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:59):**  Well, so the access to land and the access to capital are the main bottlenecks here that  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:26:06):**  nationally there's a number of surveys that come out year after year.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:26:12):**  Next generation farmers continually report access to land and access to capital as being  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:26:18):**  the main obstacles.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:26:20):**  The capital piece in part would be capital to secure land but in...  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:26:27):**  Which in your case wouldn't be necessary.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:26:30):**  Right, yeah.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:26:31):**  That in what I'm describing, the land access is addressed but there still is a fair amount  
**[0:26:38-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:26:38):**  of capital need because in many cases, this model can create a transfer of land but it's  
**[0:26:46-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:26:46):**  still there's agriculture transitions, aging infrastructure, need to diversify or grow  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:26:55):**  the farm enterprise.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:26:58):**  All these different factors lead to capital needed for infrastructure investments, business  
**[0:27:05-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:05):**  investments.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:06):**  You're not taking over a completely new, just build regenerative farm.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:11):**  Correct.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:12):**  You're taking over an older one.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:13):**  And then the ideal case that the farm has long been a regenerative farm so there may  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:18):**  be very good soil health and kind of ecological health that exists but the infrastructure  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:25):**  is going to be old or there's lack of housing or need to expand markets.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:30):**  So there's other needs for capital there and that's really where investment dollars can  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:37):**  do well.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:38):**  Yeah, because this was going to be my bridge.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:40):**  What do you see?  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:42):**  You mentioned locally, I would love to come back but I'll come back to that later especially  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:46):**  as the democratization of impact investing is always a huge topic and I don't think we  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:50):**  want to have the situation where this investing in regenerative agriculture is only something  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:57):**  that the happy few can do.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:59):**  But let's spark that for a second.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:28:01):**  What do you see the role in general of impact investing dollars or not the grant dollars  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:28:07):**  in this transition?  
**[0:28:08-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:28:08):**  Yeah, so I really see the role for those impact investing dollars to be focused on investments  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:28:20):**  needed in the land once that ownership transfer has happened.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:28:25):**  So whether it is investment in soils and ecological health because the farmland has been fallow  
**[0:28:33-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:28:33):**  or it's been in conventional monoculture ag that's destroyed and depleted the soils, so  
**[0:28:42-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:28:42):**  soil and ecological investment is part of it.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:28:49):**  As our climate changes, the need to control water is more and more significant.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:28:56):**  Control water whether it's secure or sustainable access to water or it's mitigating extreme  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:29:03):**  weather events that have not enough and then too much water but how do you better manage  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:29:10):**  the water that you need.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:29:12):**  But there's also kind of the how do you expand and grow your markets.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:29:17):**  So impact investing dollars to focus on the farm business itself and give them whether  
**[0:29:25-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:29:25):**  it's market expansion or diversification, whether it's building and infrastructure needs.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:29:33):**  There's a variety of financial needs that a farm will have once they're on the land  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:29:40):**  for those dollars.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:29:42):**  A great example would be that our dairy industry in this country and elsewhere is really struggling.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:29:51):**  In many other countries as well.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:29:54):**  So there's a lot of dairy farms that have significant infrastructure that is now those  
**[0:30:03-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:30:03):**  farms go under, they close, transition might be possible of the land in the way I describe  
**[0:30:11-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:30:11):**  but then you have this huge amount of infrastructure and equipment that may have little value for  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:30:20):**  a diversified regenerative food production farm.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:30:24):**  So how do you repurpose some infrastructure?  
**[0:30:28-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:30:28):**  A lot of times you really need to construct new but it's on the business side that investment  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:30:36):**  dollars would really be the most helpful.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:30:41):**  And do you see, just to put my investor hat on, are these new, let's say the new generations  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:30:49):**  of agrarians that are entering these lands, so the land is secured by the trust, hopefully  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:30:55):**  local plus the easement is in place or is no longer in place.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:00):**  And so do you see that they are investment ready?  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:05):**  Is that different than for instance a few generations before where you see the languages  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:10):**  of a farmer and investor were so different that they hardly ever met?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:14):**  Is the new generation more ready to take on investment capital?  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:20):**  Some are, there's a fair amount.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:23):**  Or there's work to do for you as well.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:25):**  Yeah, there is a lot of work to do there.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:28):**  There are a number of really good agricultural universities, farm incubator programs, farm  
**[0:31:36-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:36):**  start and readiness programs that are really giving many next generation farmers the skills,  
**[0:31:43-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:43):**  experience and literacy they need to run a successful business and be kind of investment  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:51):**  ready.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:52):**  But they're nowhere near meeting the need that exists.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:57):**  So there's a lot of farmers that are not yet investment ready.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:02):**  But there are some that are kind of capable and ready of launching given the right financial  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:10):**  investment.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:11):**  And do you see that the investors are, let's say, investor ready to deal with farm investments  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:18):**  or farmer investments as it's very different from what some may are used to if you are  
**[0:32:24-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:24):**  coming from the West Coast and are used to, let's say, technology, Instagram investments.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:30):**  Do you see that also there there's an education part or an investor ready program needed?  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:36):**  Yeah, there's some investors that are really leading the way with this and doing a great  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:42):**  job.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:43):**  But there's a great deal of education needed that, you know, farming is a high risk, low  
**[0:32:49-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:49):**  return business, our weather and our the value and monetary kind of assets that we're willing  
**[0:32:58-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:58):**  as a culture and as individuals willing to place into local food production is very small.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:33:05):**  So there's investors need to be comfortable with higher risk, whether it be the weather,  
**[0:33:13-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:33:13):**  whether it be a variety of reasons for crop failure and also lower returns that that many  
**[0:33:22-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:33:22):**  there's many farm products that are grown or raised have very slim margin profit margins  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:33:29):**  on them.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:33:31):**  And it's just there's there's no way to truly generate the returns that many investors would  
**[0:33:38-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:33:38):**  like for these higher risk farm investments, given our relationship to food and how we  
**[0:33:46-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:33:46):**  value food.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:33:48):**  But it's the you know, agriculture, small scale regenerative agriculture in this country,  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:33:55):**  just as working on very slim margins.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:33:59):**  And you're hinting to a potential solution there.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:01):**  But what would be what would be some of the potential solutions?  
**[0:34:06-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:06):**  Not that we have to start doing double digit returns, etc.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:10):**  But what would be potential solutions for that huge challenge because it holds up a  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:15):**  lot of money that doesn't dare to get into the space because of this perceived and real  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:21):**  risk and also because of the returns?  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:24):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:25):**  Well, so part of it, I believe, is that, you know, great wealth has been accumulated in  
**[0:34:33-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:33):**  this country through extractive industries and extractive industries that have extracted  
**[0:34:41-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:41):**  resources and soil health and exploitive industries that have exploited human labor and dignity  
**[0:34:49-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:49):**  and community health.  
**[0:34:52-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:52):**  So we collectively need to realize that that the return the investment returns were used  
**[0:35:00-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:35:00):**  to and the wealth that many of us are have and have grown accustomed to is based upon  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:35:08):**  extraction and exploitation in many ways.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:35:12):**  And and really, if we're talking about regenerative agriculture that depends upon healthy soil  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:35:19):**  and healthy ecosystem and a resilient and healthy community, we need to be comfortable  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:35:26):**  to invest money that has a negative rate of return.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:35:32):**  We need to return wealth into the soil and the ecosystem and communities that we've extracted  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:35:40):**  from for too long.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:35:41):**  So that's a, you know, a cultural shift that is needed.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:35:45):**  On one hand, another reality that I think is important is to measure returns, not just  
**[0:35:52-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:35:52):**  in the financial rate of return, but in in social benefits and ecological and environmental  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:00):**  benefits that come with those investments.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:03):**  So, you know, a lower or a zero or negative rate of return where we're able to improve  
**[0:36:13-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:13):**  soil health, say, and sequester carbon, we need to find a way to either attach monetary  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:21):**  value to that carbon sequestration in a way that creates robust markets that can generate  
**[0:36:27-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:27):**  revenue, or personally find satisfaction in investing in soil health that sequesters carbon.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:36):**  And there's many other kind of markers that we need to look at beyond carbon sequestration.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:42):**  But that's just one example.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:43):**  But we need to look at ways that that are rebuilding what we've extracted and exploited.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:51):**  And they're completely, completely agreed.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:53):**  And I think there's a case to make for paying more for food if you're able.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:58):**  But that's of course that comes into the personal choices in the kitchen.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:03):**  And do you see that there is, I wouldn't say exponential improvement, but that the regenerative  
**[0:37:09-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:09):**  farms are improving in a sense and are getting better as they are restoring soil, that there  
**[0:37:15-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:15):**  is a mechanism working there that it does, the margins maybe get better or the amount  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:21):**  of biomass created or the amount of different products.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:25):**  So that it's not a downward spiral, but maybe it's very slow, an upward spiral, maybe because  
**[0:37:31-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:31):**  the technology is getting better.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:32):**  Do you see improvements there?  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:34):**  Are we the same place we were maybe five or 10 years ago in terms of regen ag?  
**[0:37:38-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:38):**  Yeah, yeah, huge improvements there that, you know, the kind of where we sit now, the  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:45):**  general interest and awareness and engagement and discussion around regenerative ag and  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:51):**  those involved in that, that's huge growth kind of in that aspect of things.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:57):**  I also, so with Agrarian Trust, many of the initial farms that we're working with now,  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:38:05):**  we're focusing on these legacy farms.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:38:09):**  We're defining legacy farms as these farmers that started in the 70s, 80s, 90s, so decades  
**[0:38:18-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:38:18):**  ago, and we're focused on regenerative ag then.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:38:23):**  So we're working with kind of the oldest organic regenerative farm in Tennessee, for example,  
**[0:38:32-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:38:32):**  and other states around the country, but the soil health and the systems they've set up  
**[0:38:40-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:38:40):**  there over decades of practice of an investment in the soil, their yields and their kind of  
**[0:38:51-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:38:51):**  resilience to weather events, to pest infestations is significant there, that they're decades  
**[0:39:03-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:39:03):**  ahead of other farms in kind of their production levels there, and so they, it's very interesting  
**[0:39:13-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:39:13):**  to talk to these farmers and to then observe their operations, but they're able to produce  
**[0:39:21-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:39:21):**  so much more with much less labour and time and much lower risk than similar regenerative  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:39:30):**  agriculture farms that have started in the last five years, say, that just the health  
**[0:39:35-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:39:35):**  of the ecosystem and the soils they've created there really is a great risk mitigator.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:39:43):**  And do you see that as one of your roles to get that knowledge, to unlock, let's say,  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:39:47):**  that knowledge from the people that have been doing this for decades and with trial and  
**[0:39:52-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:39:52):**  error got to a really high level?  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:39:56):**  Do you see unlocking that knowledge and get that to the next-gen group that's now getting  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:01):**  on the land and hopefully, maybe not taking decades, but a decade to get to that level?  
**[0:40:06-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:06):**  Is it something you're focusing on?  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:08):**  I cannot imagine not.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:09):**  Yeah, we're completely focusing on that.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:12):**  So Agrarian Trust, part of our mission is to support land access for next-generation  
**[0:40:19-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:19):**  farmers.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:20):**  So we could go about that by engaging these next-generation farmers and just helping them  
**[0:40:27-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:27):**  get on land, any land that's close to them or that's available or we have the opportunity  
**[0:40:35-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:35):**  for.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:36):**  But we feel it's a waste of everyone's resources to help a next-generation farmer get onto  
**[0:40:44-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:44):**  land that is degraded or fallow or lacks many of these things while these older generation  
**[0:40:52-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:52):**  legacy farms close and just fall back into no production and no active farming on the  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:02):**  ground and soon are retaken by nature.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:08):**  We feel that connecting the transfer of land from these legacy farms to appropriate next-generation  
**[0:41:15-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:15):**  farmers who are a good fit is really a way on the land side to give those next-generation  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:22):**  farmers decades worth of head start in doing what they're doing.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:27):**  And it's a way for the exiting farmer to create a legacy.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:32):**  Which he or she probably is really looking for.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:34):**  They're not looking to sell to the next project developer and knocks on their farm door.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:40):**  Exactly.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:41):**  So helping them create that legacy also is a great motivator to help them donate their  
**[0:41:50-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:50):**  land after they sell a conservation easement.  
**[0:41:53-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:53):**  That they're more willing to forego some of the profits that they might see if they sold  
**[0:42:00-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:00):**  to developer.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:02):**  If that transfer from them and the donation to nonprofit is creating a legacy upon which  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:09):**  they had started.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:12):**  So that's a great transfer of the land and gives those next-generation farmers a head  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:19):**  start.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:20):**  We also feel and are working now, so in that transfer of land that I've described, it allows  
**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:28):**  the older generation legacy farmer to exit.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:32):**  But a lot of times people still desire a life purpose and want to be involved.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:39):**  Just because they want to exit being the primary farmer and owner of and holding the risk and  
**[0:42:47-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:47):**  the management of the whole, they still want to be involved.  
**[0:42:52-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:52):**  They have such great knowledge of that land and of the community they're involved in.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:43:00):**  So how do we in that transfer process not only transfer land and the farm organism,  
**[0:43:08-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:43:08):**  but how do we transfer that knowledge and the human relationships and health.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:43:15):**  So finding ways for the exiting farmer to stay on, holding say a life estate where they're  
**[0:43:22-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:43:22):**  still going to live in a house on the farm and be part of, but no longer the farmer.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:43:28):**  Or allowing them to stay on as kind of a consultant to convey their knowledge and experience to  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:43:35):**  the next generation farmer is so important for all sides.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:43:40):**  So it's the transition of land, but it's also the transition of humans and the knowledge  
**[0:43:47-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:43:47):**  and health of all.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:43:48):**  Absolutely agreed.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:43:50):**  Let's have a look at the democratization part because you've mentioned a number of times  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:43:55):**  the local farm commons, in this case, let's look at the local.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:44:00):**  How do you get the local community that might not be accredited investor that might not  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:44:05):**  have millions in the bank to invest in infrastructure on an amazing regenerative farm?  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:44:12):**  How do you get retail investors like myself involved in something like this?  
**[0:44:17-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:44:17):**  Well, so through the foundation I ran, I've done a couple of these type of projects that  
**[0:44:24-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:44:24):**  we're talking about now.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:44:26):**  And so what we at Agrarian Trust are doing is building upon and expanding that work.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:44:32):**  So what I've done to date to kind of provide opportunity for all in the community to become  
**[0:44:42-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:44:42):**  investor and not just write the accredited investors is through a couple of methods.  
**[0:44:49-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:44:49):**  So one is through, there's different community kind of crowdsource fundraising platforms.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:45:00):**  Like Wefunder is one of them in the States that is licensed crowdsource investment model  
**[0:45:08-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:45:08):**  that's available for everyone to invest similar to like a Kiva, Zip and their loan program.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:45:19):**  But this allows for larger investments and investments in the land.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:45:23):**  So that's one kind of through crowdsource investment.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:45:28):**  Another that I've utilized is partnering with community banks that can be the intermediary  
**[0:45:38-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:45:38):**  and take in investments from any number of people at whatever the minimum that we want  
**[0:45:46-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:45:46):**  to set for the project is.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:45:49):**  And then they can aggregate those total investments and then kind of with a friendly community  
**[0:45:58-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:45:58):**  bank or community loan fund or other, there's some mission alignment there.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:46:06):**  So they're willing in many cases to manage that kind of portfolio of community investors  
**[0:46:15-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:46:15):**  at a low management fee.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:46:18):**  So passing on favorable terms to the farmer who gets a single loan at the end.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:46:26):**  So that's another way is kind of aggregated through community banks, community loan funds  
**[0:46:33-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:46:33):**  and others.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:46:34):**  So that's also a way to do it.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:46:37):**  We at Agrarian Trust are going to do both of those models and so work with both kind  
**[0:46:47-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:46:47):**  of larger social lending institutions and smaller localized community loan funds who  
**[0:46:54-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:46:54):**  can aggregate dollars.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:46:57):**  We're also kind of setting up a structure where we will be able to offer out investment  
**[0:47:05-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:47:05):**  opportunities directly through Agrarian Trust and these 501c2 farm commons entities where  
**[0:47:15-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:47:15):**  we will be licensed to provide investment opportunities out for investors of all types  
**[0:47:24-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:47:24):**  to invest directly in these farm commons entities.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:47:28):**  And then at some point you can aggregate and make less of a risk or is before individual  
**[0:47:32-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:47:32):**  ones like you mentioned before, it is a risky business to get access to that.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:47:38):**  That would be very interesting as always in these huge transitions like you see in energy  
**[0:47:42-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:47:42):**  and in food, it's very difficult for local normal people with not a huge wallet to get  
**[0:47:49-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:47:49):**  into these things and it almost happens to us instead of us being part of it.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:47:54):**  Of course as a customer and maybe working on the farms, but not as we're often not able  
**[0:48:01-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:01):**  to vote with our dollars or euros.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:03):**  Right correct.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:04):**  Yeah and so part of the goal with the farm commons is to that these localized farm commons  
**[0:48:11-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:11):**  would own the farms and the farms would come into ownership through that kind of partnership  
**[0:48:18-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:18):**  with the conservation land trusts and philanthropic dollars.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:22):**  So farm commons would have a significant asset base in the farms they own that could help  
**[0:48:31-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:31):**  kind of mitigate risk of investment dollars in that are focused on the farm businesses.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:38):**  And how strict are you on let's say soil building?  
**[0:48:43-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:43):**  Is that really built into these commons as a main prerequisite of farmers to get long  
**[0:48:50-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:50):**  term leases?  
**[0:48:51-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:51):**  Are you measuring that?  
**[0:48:52-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:52):**  Are you punishing people or farmers if they're not building enough soil?  
**[0:48:56-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:56):**  How strict are you on the soil part?  
**[0:48:59-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:59):**  Yeah so that is our focus in kind of back to conservation land trusts, community land  
**[0:49:07-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:49:07):**  trusts.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:49:08):**  They're not as focused on soil health or at all focused on soil health.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:49:14):**  They also are not focused on farming practices.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:49:18):**  So the type of farming they just kind of allow agriculture, any type of agriculture.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:49:24):**  So we agrarian trust feel that it is critical and feel there's a real need and opportunity  
**[0:49:32-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:49:32):**  not being met to focus on soil health, to focus on regenerative farming practices whether  
**[0:49:41-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:49:41):**  it's kind of beyond organic, biodynamic, natural farming practices coupled with soil health.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:49:50):**  So we require those aspects.  
**[0:49:56-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:49:56):**  So we are, as we take ownership we are creating kind of baseline status for the health of  
**[0:50:06-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:50:06):**  the soil, for the status and health of the ecosystem, the water quality that exists and  
**[0:50:15-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:50:15):**  then we will kind of create some type of punishment mechanism if there's violations to that.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:50:26):**  But the primary structure will be to incentivize farmers through lowering the lease costs and  
**[0:50:36-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:50:36):**  through some shared collaboration and investment in ecosystem health by agrarian trust.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:50:45):**  So if they're improving the soil health from the baseline that was taken when we agrarian  
**[0:50:53-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:50:53):**  trust take ownership of, they will be, farmers will benefit from reduction in their lease  
**[0:51:01-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:51:01):**  rates in shared investment from agrarian trust in the farm business itself.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:51:12):**  So we're hoping that through kind of carrot instead of a stick you get a better relationship.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:51:19):**  Pun, I mean agricultural pun definitely intended.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:51:23):**  And to close it off because I want to be conscious of our time as well as we're approaching the  
**[0:51:27-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:51:27):**  hour already I think we can spend at least another one talking about this in the details.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:51:33):**  What would be your advice, obviously not investment advice, but your advice to let's imagine there's  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:51:38):**  a room full or a theater full of smart impact investors that are understanding soil and  
**[0:51:43-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:51:43):**  getting to understand the issues around it but are ready and eager to get into the space.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:51:50):**  What would be your advice?  
**[0:51:54-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:51:54):**  Well so part of my advice would be look for agricultural projects that are at a scale  
**[0:52:02-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:52:02):**  that's going to be meaningful and that are things that are relevant to local communities  
**[0:52:11-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:52:11):**  and to kind of the food culture that exists.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:52:18):**  So to focus on projects that acreage is too small or are single one-off projects won't  
**[0:52:29-0:52:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:52:29):**  have the leverage needed, won't be a replicable model that others can adopt.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:52:35):**  Also projects that are kind of isolated, not connected to community, not connected to food  
**[0:52:41-0:52:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:52:41):**  sheds that exist won't really have the broader awareness that comes.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:52:47):**  So to sort of think where investment dollars could matter the most at a scale somewhere  
**[0:52:55-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:52:55):**  connected to communities and kind of food systems that are in great need.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:53:03):**  So that's part of the reason that we at agrarian trust are focusing some of our initial work  
**[0:53:10-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:53:10):**  in Appalachia that that part of the country has a little bit larger acreage than the northeast  
**[0:53:22-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:53:22):**  and not the size of farmland acreage that the Midwest of this country has.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:53:30):**  So we feel agrarian trust that we can really make a difference in Tennessee, Kentucky,  
**[0:53:37-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:53:37):**  West Virginia, that region by focusing on our model and bringing about regenerative  
**[0:53:47-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:53:47):**  agriculture in a way that creates soil and ecosystem health where there's these farms  
**[0:53:56-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:53:56):**  that exist that are at the right size and have some connection to food sheds and communities  
**[0:54:06-0:54:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:06):**  that really still value and depend upon local food production.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:12):**  So the new generation doesn't have to invent everything themselves and take three decades  
**[0:54:18-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:18):**  to get to that level.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:19):**  Correct, yeah.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:20):**  That's great advice.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:21):**  I want to thank you Ian for your time this morning and I will definitely be checking  
**[0:54:26-0:54:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:26):**  in.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:27):**  I mean congratulations to the director Raul that you took a few months ago and let's say  
**[0:54:33-0:54:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:33):**  in a year or so to see some exciting projects, many things will be moving I think in the  
**[0:54:40-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:40):**  next 12 months.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:41):**  If I look 12 months ago compared to now, the excitement around soil and regenerative agriculture  
**[0:54:46-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:46):**  is only growing.

**[0:56:06-0:56:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:56:06):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:56:11-0:56:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:56:11):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:56:15):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:56:16-0:56:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:56:16):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:56:20-0:56:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:56:20):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:56:25-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:56:25):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:57:08-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:08):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:57:12-0:57:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:12):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting

**[0:57:23-0:57:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:23):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:57:24-0:57:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:24):**  No.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:25):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:27):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:57:32-0:57:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:32):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:37):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:57:42-0:57:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:42):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:45):**  Thank you.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:46):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:57:47-0:57:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:47):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:53):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:57:55-0:58:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:55):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:58:00-0:58:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:58:00):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:58:06-0:58:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:58:06):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:58:10-0:58:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:58:10):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:58:12):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:58:17-0:58:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:58:17):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:58:21):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:58:25):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:58:26-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:58:26):**  It's not a list of investable deals.

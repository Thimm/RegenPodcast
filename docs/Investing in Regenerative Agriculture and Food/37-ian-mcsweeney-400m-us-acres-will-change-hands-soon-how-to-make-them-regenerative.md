### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2018-08-04)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:14):**  You'll be listening to an interview with Ian where we talk about land ownership and land  ownership transition.  The way that land ownership transitions is absolutely key to the future of agriculture  
**[0:00:24-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:24):**  and thus the planet.  Done well, it could give the next generation of regenerative farmers access to land under  the circumstances which pushes them to be even more regenerative.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:32):**  But done wrong, it could force the next generation of farmers to destroy even more soil against  their will.  I hope you enjoy it.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:45):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  the planet mattered.  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:00:54):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:07):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:18):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:30):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more  depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:43):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:01:55):**  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  And now, without further ado, the interview.  Enjoy.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:05):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  I'm Koonvassai, your host.  And today I'm talking to Ian McSweeney, the director of the Agrarian Trust.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:13):**  The Agrarian Trust mission is to support land access for the next generation of farmers,  supporting all stakeholders from farmers and community members to activists and investors  in this absolutely key process.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:25):**  This last bit I added myself.  Welcome Ian.  Thank you, Koonvassai.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:29):**  Thank you for having me on.  I look forward to our conversation.  And to start that conversation with a personal question, what brings you to the Agrarian  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:02:37):**  Trust, what brings you to soil and food and delegating your career basically to that?  Yeah, I have always had a real desire to work with and help people through their life journey.  And that early on manifest in me working as social worker and helping people kind of solve  
**[0:03:01-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:01):**  life's problems and manage their kind of struggles.  So I did that for a number of years but I kind of didn't see the long term impact and  connection that I was hoping for and the people I was working with and really have personally  
**[0:03:21-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:21):**  always been connected to land and food myself and have strong childhood memories and now  have young children myself and I'm raising them connected to the land.  So really saw the connection people have to land for one reason or another, memories,  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:42):**  direct connection in their work with land.  So really thought that how can I work with people in their life journey as it relates  to land.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:03:52):**  And so left social work, got into real estate and planning and did that for a number of  years, founded a real estate company that connected development in a way that was sensitive  and prioritized agriculture and community building.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:04:11):**  So worked doing that, did a number of kind of planned community projects that conserved  land, brought about active agriculture and built community.  And in doing that and running that business, opportunity came up to run a private foundation,  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:04:30):**  the Russell Foundation.  So I transitioned into the world of philanthropy and operated the Russell Foundation for a  dozen years.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:04:42):**  Russell Foundation's focus was land conservation in general with a priority towards agriculture  and people's connection to food and farmland.  So that kind of allowed me to really live into that work and explore ways that I could  
**[0:05:03-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:05:03):**  innovate what existed around farmland conservation work and kind of community engagement with  agriculture.  So that's been where I've been the last dozen years and it's given me a great foundation  
**[0:05:19-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:05:19):**  of work, experience and networking with others and kind of many kind of different types of  land-based projects.  So from that, I was able to kind of build upon that work and move into present work,  
**[0:05:40-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:05:40):**  leading Agrarian Trust which is a newer agricultural focus national land trust that we can talk  more about.  But Agrarian Trust's focus is really to innovate how we hold land and how we bring together  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:05:59):**  people and money to make that possible, all to address the transfer of land that's going  on presently in this country.  To just give a bit of context, how much, because on your website you stated immediately, it's  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:14):**  predicted that 400 million acres of US farmland will change hands in the next two decades.  That sounds like a lot, but just to put it in context, what is the percentage of, why  is it such an important issue at the moment?  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:28):**  Why we should all and hopefully all the impact investors that are listening care about the  land changing hands over the next decade?  Why is it key to many of the issues that you've been working on for life?  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:41):**  Yeah, so that is a lot of land.  The average age of a farmland owner in the States is a little over 65 years old.  It sounds like pension age.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:06:52):**  So because of that, a lot of people are needing to or being forced to transfer farmland they've  owned for generations.  So that 400 million acres is more acreage than all the national parks and other federally  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:08):**  owned land in this country.  So our work as a nation here to build a collective national parks for common benefit and kind  of a great pride that our country has has happened over quite a bit of time.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:29):**  And we've built upon that and continue to build upon that.  But we're now faced with a situation where more acreage than we have accumulated in public  trust through federal and private and state ownership in parkland is going to transfer  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:46):**  in the farmland.  So that's significant amount of farmland that is transferring now.  And really it's different parts of the country have different drivers for why that land is  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:07:59):**  transferring.  A lot of it is falling out of small scale family run food producing farms that are focused  on soil ecosystem and community health.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:08:15):**  So that is being lost at a significant rate as farmland is being converted for development,  for other extractive uses.  It's being bought up and aggregated by larger agricultural companies and investment houses.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:08:41):**  So and then run more as commodity agriculture.  Land is also going fallow as well in certain parts as certain parts of our country are  depopulated of people as much of that can be attributed to kind of urban job opportunities  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:03):**  and pulling people out of country and lack of agricultural and land-based opportunities  in rural parts of the country.  But as places get depopulated, land is also going fallow as well.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:17):**  So there's a lot of factors that are kind of moving this transition away from sustainable  and regenerative small scale food production agriculture.  And it's significant.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:31):**  So we need multiple tools to really address it.  And what are a few examples of those tools that you just mentioned?  What can we do or what are things that the agrarian trust is currently working on?  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:09:46):**  You became the director two or three months ago.  But what is the most urgent thing you're working on at the moment in this huge transition?  And this is so many acres, we can hardly imagine it, but what's the first step?  
**[0:10:01-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:10:01):**  Yeah, well, so that in the States, there's really a large community of conservation organizations  that have long been protecting natural resources for public benefit.  So that's come the private movement in conservation organizations coming out of kind of the public  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:10:25):**  work around national parks.  So we have a good and healthy community that is protecting natural resources, but that  community, the land trust, state, federal organizations and entities doing that work  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:10:44):**  are focused on protection of the land, really not as much on who owns it and how we deal  with that transfer of land that has been left really for private ownership.  And there's a real impulse in the States for private individual property rights and ownership  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:11:04):**  that's driven that.  We at Agrarian Trust see the need for an alternative to that, a need to collaborate with the conservation  organizations that are protecting the natural resources, but really a need to address who  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:11:21):**  owns the land and how it is owned.  So we, Agrarian Trust, see work of community land trusts who have long worked in the States  as well, but they're more focused on social endeavors.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:11:40):**  Affordable housing would be one.  So they own land for affordable housing and for other social community-based needs, not  as much for agriculture though.  
**[0:11:53-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:11:53):**  So we see kind of how can we look at the best of what conservation land trusts and organizations  and community land trusts and cooperatives and housing do and bring those together in  a way that looks at who owns the land, who owns the actual fee interest in the land.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:12:16):**  So we, Agrarian Trust, are setting up entities, localized farm commons entities, 501C2 structure,  non-profit to own land for the benefit of communities.  So it would partner with the conservation and community groups to bring about ownership  
**[0:12:41-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:12:41):**  of farmland by these farm commons entities, removing the land from the commodity marketplace  and holding the land in a long-term relationship with farmers who will have tenure, 99-year  lease and equity arrangements on the land where they will have access and autonomous  
**[0:13:07-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:13:07):**  control to operate on the ground and Agrarian Trust through these farm commons entities  and other organizations as well who are setting up these farm commons, these 501C2 land holding  entities can own this land so they can work as a non-profit and raise money, both philanthropic  
**[0:13:30-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:13:30):**  dollars and investment dollars in to the farm commons 501C2 entity and that 501C2 farm commons  entity can then own farmland and provide long-term lease out to farmers and other community enterprises.  And we really feel that there's a need to address the ownership and how you kind of  
**[0:13:56-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:13:56):**  remove the value from that land, that farmland in this country has appreciated quite significantly  over the last few decades.  So many farms that I work with who may have started in the 1980s, 1990s have seen their  
**[0:14:19-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:14:19):**  value, the farmland, the acre value of their land go up by thousands of percent over time.  So the appreciation of that farmland is significant and it's created a present value where it  is unaffordable for next generation farmers to come on.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:14:42):**  It's unaffordable to afford that land debt on the revenue of a farm enterprise.  So we need to find a way to extract the appreciated value of that farmland and bring it into this  ownership that will remove future sales and remove speculative appreciation of land values  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:08):**  and set affordable long-term lease rates for that.  So I have a lot of questions to unpack there.  First of all, you mentioned it now as well, like the current value of the land, like the  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:20):**  current price you pay on the market is no longer connected to what the land sustainably  or regeneratively can produce of it in terms of cashflow.  And that created a huge disbalance and that's why it's so difficult for new generations  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:37):**  that are hopefully more regenerative to get into agriculture.  That's one of the main...  Correct.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:43):**  But if that's the case and the prices of these lands and acres are so high, how do you take  them off the market?  How are you able to buy them?  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:15:56):**  How are you paying the current prices and thus also maybe helping the market to sustain  itself, which is in itself maybe not a good thing.  And if not the current prices, how do you make sure you, how are you acquiring this  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:09):**  land without paying the main, the big price that nobody else can afford at the moment?  Yeah.  So a combination of ways.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:20):**  So many farmland in areas where there's high development pressures, there's many of the  conservation land trusts that I mentioned who work in a lot of, mainly in kind of around  urban areas and on the east and west coast of this country is where they're centered.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:42):**  But there's a lot of conservation organizations that are, their work is to protect lands,  their resources.  And they do that primarily through acquiring conservation easements on the land.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:16:57):**  The conservation easements permanently remove the development and extractive uses of that  land.  And there's, there could always be more conservation land trusts.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:12):**  There could always be more dollars for conservation land trusts to do their work.  But there's a robust community of conservation land trusts and there's a significant amount  of federal, state, local, private dollars, philanthropic dollars to acquire those conservation  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:33):**  easements.  And just to, for the international audience, how does an easement work in practice?  Can you give a very simple example from one of the many farms you worked with?  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:49):**  Who pays who?  What does it mean?  And what does it, what does it mean for the sector?  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:17:55):**  Sure.  Yeah.  So, so that easements on land are, are kind of giving a third party certain rights to  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:18:05):**  that land.  So there are many easements that give affirmative rights, specifically like a, a municipality  or a state will have easements on private property to have roads and to maintain roads  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:18:24):**  that in many cases they do not own the land a road sits on.  They hold an easement across private property to maintain a road.  The power companies do the same thing with their utility lines and connections.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:18:42):**  So there's easements that give affirmative rights in those ways that have long existed.  There's also conservation easements and what they do is they take the, the rights of property.  So in this country private property rights are, are held very closely by the individual  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:19:04):**  and they've long been a priority embedded in our culture.  So the private property rights give someone who owns property the right to do a number  of things on their property subject to local and state zoning regulations.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:19:21):**  So an individual who owns private property can build homes, they could extract natural  resources, they could farm, have forest management, they could have recreation or just enjoy the  property.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:19:42):**  What a conservation easement does is it removes certain rights.  So those rights to build homes, residential homes, the right to build kind of commercial  or industrial buildings, the rights to extract soil, oil, gas, minerals, those rights of  
**[0:20:02-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:02):**  the property are severed from private ownership and those rights are then held by some public  entity, whether it is a federal government, state entities or these private nonprofits,  conservation land trusts.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:21):**  And there's other entities that may hold those rights as well.  But these entities will hold the development rights and the extraction rights of property  and they will permanently hold those.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:35):**  And they pay for them?  Yeah, and they'll pay for those.  So they'll hold those...  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:39):**  To the farmer or to the owner.  To the owner, right.  So they're holding those permanently.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:20:44):**  So they're permanently extracting that ability of the private owner to exercise those rights  on the property.  And so in that process, when that entity acquires those rights in the conservation easement,  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:21:00):**  there is a third party appraisal done that looks at the value of the property with all  the rights that exist and the value of the property without those rights.  So what is the value of a parcel of land if it can no longer be developed for housing  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:21:19):**  or commercial uses and it can no longer extract natural resources from it?  It's a much lower value.  And so for example, in urban areas that have significant development pressure on the rural  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:21:37):**  outskirts around those urban areas, so the Northeast, for example, where you're close  to Boston, New York and the whole Northeast corridor there, that the conservation easement  value is between kind of 60 and 80% of the total value of the raw land.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:22:02):**  So in urban areas in the middle of the country and then really the East and West coast of  the country here, that if this work is done in partnership with a conservation land trust  or other conservation organization where they acquire the conservation easement and they're  
**[0:22:21-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:22:21):**  using a variety of grant and philanthropic funds, they're able to come up with and compensate  private landowner for the vast majority of the value of the land through extracting those  rights that really a farmer really never wants to exercise those rights anyways.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:22:45):**  They're trying to farm in the land, they're not trying to develop the land or sell off  the topsoil.  So working with conservation organizations is a good way to buy down the value of the  
**[0:22:59-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:22:59):**  land and then kind of some landowners simply getting compensated for the conservation easement  at that portion of the value of the raw land is enough for them to be compensated and exit  ownership in total.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:23:21):**  And retire.  And retire, right.  And think back to the great appreciation of the land.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:23:26):**  So many long time farmers, they have seen the land appreciate significantly so them  getting 80% of the value of the raw land today is far more than they ever expected to or  need to retire on.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:23:44):**  So they're satisfied receiving those conservation easement proceeds and then donating or in  some cases where there might be a little more money needed, kind of providing a very significant  discount sale on the land to then either next owner, private owner or what we agrarian trust  
**[0:24:08-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:24:08):**  are doing is then they could donate the land into a nonprofit, agrarian trust or to other  nonprofits that are working in that space.  And in doing that, landowner has received enough compensation through the conservation  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:24:28):**  easement sale in donating the land to a nonprofit.  There's tax benefits for them that can reduce the tax liability they have on the proceeds  of that easement sale and other income.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:24:43):**  So there's financial benefit for them to donate to a nonprofit as well.  So that can work quite well is to partner with a conservation land trust, help them  raise money to purchase the conservation easement and then that compensates private landowner,  
**[0:25:03-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:03):**  private landowner can exit and then land can transfer and next generation farmer can come  on at a much more affordable access point.  And because that conservation easement is permanent, you've permanently removed that  
**[0:25:20-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:20):**  value from the land and by agrarian trust or other nonprofit owning the land, it can  permanently remove the remainder value as well.  And then you need to find a young farmer or younger farmer to farm it in a regenerative  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:39):**  way because you also mentioned some of these easements are also forbidden to extract the  soil.  So is it easy to find regenerative farmers that want to get on the land and are not extractive  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:52):**  soil?  Is that something you struggle with or is it really the access to land that is the main  bottleneck here?  
**[0:25:59-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:25:59):**  Well, so the access to land and the access to capital are the main bottlenecks here that  nationally there's a number of surveys that come out year after year.  Next generation farmers continually report access to land and access to capital as being  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:26:18):**  the main obstacles.  The capital piece in part would be capital to secure land but in...  Which in your case wouldn't be necessary.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:26:30):**  Right, yeah.  That in what I'm describing, the land access is addressed but there still is a fair amount  of capital need because in many cases, this model can create a transfer of land but it's  
**[0:26:46-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:26:46):**  still there's agriculture transitions, aging infrastructure, need to diversify or grow  the farm enterprise.  All these different factors lead to capital needed for infrastructure investments, business  
**[0:27:05-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:05):**  investments.  You're not taking over a completely new, just build regenerative farm.  Correct.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:12):**  You're taking over an older one.  And then the ideal case that the farm has long been a regenerative farm so there may  be very good soil health and kind of ecological health that exists but the infrastructure  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:25):**  is going to be old or there's lack of housing or need to expand markets.  So there's other needs for capital there and that's really where investment dollars can  do well.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:38):**  Yeah, because this was going to be my bridge.  What do you see?  You mentioned locally, I would love to come back but I'll come back to that later especially  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:46):**  as the democratization of impact investing is always a huge topic and I don't think we  want to have the situation where this investing in regenerative agriculture is only something  that the happy few can do.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:27:59):**  But let's spark that for a second.  What do you see the role in general of impact investing dollars or not the grant dollars  in this transition?  
**[0:28:08-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:28:08):**  Yeah, so I really see the role for those impact investing dollars to be focused on investments  needed in the land once that ownership transfer has happened.  So whether it is investment in soils and ecological health because the farmland has been fallow  
**[0:28:33-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:28:33):**  or it's been in conventional monoculture ag that's destroyed and depleted the soils, so  soil and ecological investment is part of it.  As our climate changes, the need to control water is more and more significant.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:28:56):**  Control water whether it's secure or sustainable access to water or it's mitigating extreme  weather events that have not enough and then too much water but how do you better manage  the water that you need.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:29:12):**  But there's also kind of the how do you expand and grow your markets.  So impact investing dollars to focus on the farm business itself and give them whether  it's market expansion or diversification, whether it's building and infrastructure needs.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:29:33):**  There's a variety of financial needs that a farm will have once they're on the land  for those dollars.  A great example would be that our dairy industry in this country and elsewhere is really struggling.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:29:51):**  In many other countries as well.  So there's a lot of dairy farms that have significant infrastructure that is now those  farms go under, they close, transition might be possible of the land in the way I describe  
**[0:30:11-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:30:11):**  but then you have this huge amount of infrastructure and equipment that may have little value for  a diversified regenerative food production farm.  So how do you repurpose some infrastructure?  
**[0:30:28-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:30:28):**  A lot of times you really need to construct new but it's on the business side that investment  dollars would really be the most helpful.  And do you see, just to put my investor hat on, are these new, let's say the new generations  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:30:49):**  of agrarians that are entering these lands, so the land is secured by the trust, hopefully  local plus the easement is in place or is no longer in place.  And so do you see that they are investment ready?  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:05):**  Is that different than for instance a few generations before where you see the languages  of a farmer and investor were so different that they hardly ever met?  Is the new generation more ready to take on investment capital?  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:20):**  Some are, there's a fair amount.  Or there's work to do for you as well.  Yeah, there is a lot of work to do there.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:28):**  There are a number of really good agricultural universities, farm incubator programs, farm  start and readiness programs that are really giving many next generation farmers the skills,  experience and literacy they need to run a successful business and be kind of investment  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:31:51):**  ready.  But they're nowhere near meeting the need that exists.  So there's a lot of farmers that are not yet investment ready.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:02):**  But there are some that are kind of capable and ready of launching given the right financial  investment.  And do you see that the investors are, let's say, investor ready to deal with farm investments  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:18):**  or farmer investments as it's very different from what some may are used to if you are  coming from the West Coast and are used to, let's say, technology, Instagram investments.  Do you see that also there there's an education part or an investor ready program needed?  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:36):**  Yeah, there's some investors that are really leading the way with this and doing a great  job.  But there's a great deal of education needed that, you know, farming is a high risk, low  
**[0:32:49-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:32:49):**  return business, our weather and our the value and monetary kind of assets that we're willing  as a culture and as individuals willing to place into local food production is very small.  So there's investors need to be comfortable with higher risk, whether it be the weather,  
**[0:33:13-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:33:13):**  whether it be a variety of reasons for crop failure and also lower returns that that many  there's many farm products that are grown or raised have very slim margin profit margins  on them.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:33:31):**  And it's just there's there's no way to truly generate the returns that many investors would  like for these higher risk farm investments, given our relationship to food and how we  value food.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:33:48):**  But it's the you know, agriculture, small scale regenerative agriculture in this country,  just as working on very slim margins.  And you're hinting to a potential solution there.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:01):**  But what would be what would be some of the potential solutions?  Not that we have to start doing double digit returns, etc.  But what would be potential solutions for that huge challenge because it holds up a  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:15):**  lot of money that doesn't dare to get into the space because of this perceived and real  risk and also because of the returns?  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:25):**  Well, so part of it, I believe, is that, you know, great wealth has been accumulated in  this country through extractive industries and extractive industries that have extracted  resources and soil health and exploitive industries that have exploited human labor and dignity  
**[0:34:49-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:34:49):**  and community health.  So we collectively need to realize that that the return the investment returns were used  to and the wealth that many of us are have and have grown accustomed to is based upon  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:35:08):**  extraction and exploitation in many ways.  And and really, if we're talking about regenerative agriculture that depends upon healthy soil  and healthy ecosystem and a resilient and healthy community, we need to be comfortable  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:35:26):**  to invest money that has a negative rate of return.  We need to return wealth into the soil and the ecosystem and communities that we've extracted  from for too long.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:35:41):**  So that's a, you know, a cultural shift that is needed.  On one hand, another reality that I think is important is to measure returns, not just  in the financial rate of return, but in in social benefits and ecological and environmental  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:00):**  benefits that come with those investments.  So, you know, a lower or a zero or negative rate of return where we're able to improve  soil health, say, and sequester carbon, we need to find a way to either attach monetary  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:21):**  value to that carbon sequestration in a way that creates robust markets that can generate  revenue, or personally find satisfaction in investing in soil health that sequesters carbon.  And there's many other kind of markers that we need to look at beyond carbon sequestration.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:42):**  But that's just one example.  But we need to look at ways that that are rebuilding what we've extracted and exploited.  And they're completely, completely agreed.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:36:53):**  And I think there's a case to make for paying more for food if you're able.  But that's of course that comes into the personal choices in the kitchen.  And do you see that there is, I wouldn't say exponential improvement, but that the regenerative  
**[0:37:09-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:09):**  farms are improving in a sense and are getting better as they are restoring soil, that there  is a mechanism working there that it does, the margins maybe get better or the amount  of biomass created or the amount of different products.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:25):**  So that it's not a downward spiral, but maybe it's very slow, an upward spiral, maybe because  the technology is getting better.  Do you see improvements there?  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:34):**  Are we the same place we were maybe five or 10 years ago in terms of regen ag?  Yeah, yeah, huge improvements there that, you know, the kind of where we sit now, the  general interest and awareness and engagement and discussion around regenerative ag and  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:37:51):**  those involved in that, that's huge growth kind of in that aspect of things.  I also, so with Agrarian Trust, many of the initial farms that we're working with now,  we're focusing on these legacy farms.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:38:09):**  We're defining legacy farms as these farmers that started in the 70s, 80s, 90s, so decades  ago, and we're focused on regenerative ag then.  So we're working with kind of the oldest organic regenerative farm in Tennessee, for example,  
**[0:38:32-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:38:32):**  and other states around the country, but the soil health and the systems they've set up  there over decades of practice of an investment in the soil, their yields and their kind of  resilience to weather events, to pest infestations is significant there, that they're decades  
**[0:39:03-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:39:03):**  ahead of other farms in kind of their production levels there, and so they, it's very interesting  to talk to these farmers and to then observe their operations, but they're able to produce  so much more with much less labour and time and much lower risk than similar regenerative  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:39:30):**  agriculture farms that have started in the last five years, say, that just the health  of the ecosystem and the soils they've created there really is a great risk mitigator.  And do you see that as one of your roles to get that knowledge, to unlock, let's say,  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:39:47):**  that knowledge from the people that have been doing this for decades and with trial and  error got to a really high level?  Do you see unlocking that knowledge and get that to the next-gen group that's now getting  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:01):**  on the land and hopefully, maybe not taking decades, but a decade to get to that level?  Is it something you're focusing on?  I cannot imagine not.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:09):**  Yeah, we're completely focusing on that.  So Agrarian Trust, part of our mission is to support land access for next-generation  farmers.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:20):**  So we could go about that by engaging these next-generation farmers and just helping them  get on land, any land that's close to them or that's available or we have the opportunity  for.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:40:36):**  But we feel it's a waste of everyone's resources to help a next-generation farmer get onto  land that is degraded or fallow or lacks many of these things while these older generation  legacy farms close and just fall back into no production and no active farming on the  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:02):**  ground and soon are retaken by nature.  We feel that connecting the transfer of land from these legacy farms to appropriate next-generation  farmers who are a good fit is really a way on the land side to give those next-generation  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:22):**  farmers decades worth of head start in doing what they're doing.  And it's a way for the exiting farmer to create a legacy.  Which he or she probably is really looking for.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:34):**  They're not looking to sell to the next project developer and knocks on their farm door.  Exactly.  So helping them create that legacy also is a great motivator to help them donate their  
**[0:41:50-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:41:50):**  land after they sell a conservation easement.  That they're more willing to forego some of the profits that they might see if they sold  to developer.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:02):**  If that transfer from them and the donation to nonprofit is creating a legacy upon which  they had started.  So that's a great transfer of the land and gives those next-generation farmers a head  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:19):**  start.  We also feel and are working now, so in that transfer of land that I've described, it allows  the older generation legacy farmer to exit.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:32):**  But a lot of times people still desire a life purpose and want to be involved.  Just because they want to exit being the primary farmer and owner of and holding the risk and  the management of the whole, they still want to be involved.  
**[0:42:52-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:42:52):**  They have such great knowledge of that land and of the community they're involved in.  So how do we in that transfer process not only transfer land and the farm organism,  but how do we transfer that knowledge and the human relationships and health.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:43:15):**  So finding ways for the exiting farmer to stay on, holding say a life estate where they're  still going to live in a house on the farm and be part of, but no longer the farmer.  Or allowing them to stay on as kind of a consultant to convey their knowledge and experience to  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:43:35):**  the next generation farmer is so important for all sides.  So it's the transition of land, but it's also the transition of humans and the knowledge  and health of all.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:43:48):**  Absolutely agreed.  Let's have a look at the democratization part because you've mentioned a number of times  the local farm commons, in this case, let's look at the local.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:44:00):**  How do you get the local community that might not be accredited investor that might not  have millions in the bank to invest in infrastructure on an amazing regenerative farm?  How do you get retail investors like myself involved in something like this?  
**[0:44:17-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:44:17):**  Well, so through the foundation I ran, I've done a couple of these type of projects that  we're talking about now.  And so what we at Agrarian Trust are doing is building upon and expanding that work.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:44:32):**  So what I've done to date to kind of provide opportunity for all in the community to become  investor and not just write the accredited investors is through a couple of methods.  So one is through, there's different community kind of crowdsource fundraising platforms.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:45:00):**  Like Wefunder is one of them in the States that is licensed crowdsource investment model  that's available for everyone to invest similar to like a Kiva, Zip and their loan program.  But this allows for larger investments and investments in the land.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:45:23):**  So that's one kind of through crowdsource investment.  Another that I've utilized is partnering with community banks that can be the intermediary  and take in investments from any number of people at whatever the minimum that we want  
**[0:45:46-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:45:46):**  to set for the project is.  And then they can aggregate those total investments and then kind of with a friendly community  bank or community loan fund or other, there's some mission alignment there.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:46:06):**  So they're willing in many cases to manage that kind of portfolio of community investors  at a low management fee.  So passing on favorable terms to the farmer who gets a single loan at the end.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:46:26):**  So that's another way is kind of aggregated through community banks, community loan funds  and others.  So that's also a way to do it.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:46:37):**  We at Agrarian Trust are going to do both of those models and so work with both kind  of larger social lending institutions and smaller localized community loan funds who  can aggregate dollars.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:46:57):**  We're also kind of setting up a structure where we will be able to offer out investment  opportunities directly through Agrarian Trust and these 501c2 farm commons entities where  we will be licensed to provide investment opportunities out for investors of all types  
**[0:47:24-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:47:24):**  to invest directly in these farm commons entities.  And then at some point you can aggregate and make less of a risk or is before individual  ones like you mentioned before, it is a risky business to get access to that.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:47:38):**  That would be very interesting as always in these huge transitions like you see in energy  and in food, it's very difficult for local normal people with not a huge wallet to get  into these things and it almost happens to us instead of us being part of it.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:47:54):**  Of course as a customer and maybe working on the farms, but not as we're often not able  to vote with our dollars or euros.  Right correct.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:04):**  Yeah and so part of the goal with the farm commons is to that these localized farm commons  would own the farms and the farms would come into ownership through that kind of partnership  with the conservation land trusts and philanthropic dollars.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:22):**  So farm commons would have a significant asset base in the farms they own that could help  kind of mitigate risk of investment dollars in that are focused on the farm businesses.  And how strict are you on let's say soil building?  
**[0:48:43-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:43):**  Is that really built into these commons as a main prerequisite of farmers to get long  term leases?  Are you measuring that?  
**[0:48:52-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:48:52):**  Are you punishing people or farmers if they're not building enough soil?  How strict are you on the soil part?  Yeah so that is our focus in kind of back to conservation land trusts, community land  
**[0:49:07-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:49:07):**  trusts.  They're not as focused on soil health or at all focused on soil health.  They also are not focused on farming practices.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:49:18):**  So the type of farming they just kind of allow agriculture, any type of agriculture.  So we agrarian trust feel that it is critical and feel there's a real need and opportunity  not being met to focus on soil health, to focus on regenerative farming practices whether  
**[0:49:41-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:49:41):**  it's kind of beyond organic, biodynamic, natural farming practices coupled with soil health.  So we require those aspects.  So we are, as we take ownership we are creating kind of baseline status for the health of  
**[0:50:06-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:50:06):**  the soil, for the status and health of the ecosystem, the water quality that exists and  then we will kind of create some type of punishment mechanism if there's violations to that.  But the primary structure will be to incentivize farmers through lowering the lease costs and  
**[0:50:36-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:50:36):**  through some shared collaboration and investment in ecosystem health by agrarian trust.  So if they're improving the soil health from the baseline that was taken when we agrarian  trust take ownership of, they will be, farmers will benefit from reduction in their lease  
**[0:51:01-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:51:01):**  rates in shared investment from agrarian trust in the farm business itself.  So we're hoping that through kind of carrot instead of a stick you get a better relationship.  Pun, I mean agricultural pun definitely intended.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:51:23):**  And to close it off because I want to be conscious of our time as well as we're approaching the  hour already I think we can spend at least another one talking about this in the details.  What would be your advice, obviously not investment advice, but your advice to let's imagine there's  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:51:38):**  a room full or a theater full of smart impact investors that are understanding soil and  getting to understand the issues around it but are ready and eager to get into the space.  What would be your advice?  
**[0:51:54-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:51:54):**  Well so part of my advice would be look for agricultural projects that are at a scale  that's going to be meaningful and that are things that are relevant to local communities  and to kind of the food culture that exists.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:52:18):**  So to focus on projects that acreage is too small or are single one-off projects won't  have the leverage needed, won't be a replicable model that others can adopt.  Also projects that are kind of isolated, not connected to community, not connected to food  
**[0:52:41-0:52:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:52:41):**  sheds that exist won't really have the broader awareness that comes.  So to sort of think where investment dollars could matter the most at a scale somewhere  connected to communities and kind of food systems that are in great need.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:53:03):**  So that's part of the reason that we at agrarian trust are focusing some of our initial work  in Appalachia that that part of the country has a little bit larger acreage than the northeast  and not the size of farmland acreage that the Midwest of this country has.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:53:30):**  So we feel agrarian trust that we can really make a difference in Tennessee, Kentucky,  West Virginia, that region by focusing on our model and bringing about regenerative  agriculture in a way that creates soil and ecosystem health where there's these farms  
**[0:53:56-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:53:56):**  that exist that are at the right size and have some connection to food sheds and communities  that really still value and depend upon local food production.  So the new generation doesn't have to invent everything themselves and take three decades  
**[0:54:18-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:18):**  to get to that level.  Correct, yeah.  That's great advice.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:21):**  I want to thank you Ian for your time this morning and I will definitely be checking  in.  I mean congratulations to the director Raul that you took a few months ago and let's say  
**[0:54:33-0:54:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:33):**  in a year or so to see some exciting projects, many things will be moving I think in the  next 12 months.  If I look 12 months ago compared to now, the excitement around soil and regenerative agriculture  
**[0:54:46-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:46):**  is only growing.  So let's check in and see what you've been busy with then and thank you for your time  today.  
**[0:54:54-0:54:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:54:54):**  Oh thank you.  It was great to talk and yeah I'd love to check in a year or so.  You listened to an interview with Ian McSweeney.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:55:01):**  I hope you enjoyed learning more about land access and the role of capital, both grants  and investment capital in this historic transition.

**[0:56:02-0:56:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:56:02):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:56:15):**  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:56:25-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:56:25):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:56:35-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:56:35):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:56:43-0:56:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:56:43):**  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  
**[0:56:47-0:56:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:56:47):**  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  You the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  
**[0:56:55-0:57:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:56:55):**  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  designers, holistic management consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:08):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  
**[0:57:22-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:22):**  et cetera.  Is this course free?  No.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:25):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:57:37-0:57:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:37):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:46):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:57:55-0:58:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:57:55):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:58:10-0:58:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:58:10):**  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:58:21):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:58:29):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/#t=0:58:36):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

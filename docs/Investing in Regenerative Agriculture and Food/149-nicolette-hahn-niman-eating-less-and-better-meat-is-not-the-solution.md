**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:00:14):**  We often hear we should eat less but better meat.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:00:17):**  Today's guest argues that is not true.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:00:19):**  We have a wide ranging conversation with someone who has been in the food system for a while,  
**[0:00:23-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:00:23):**  starting as a lawyer working with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:00:26):**  and lobbying against the pollution of the meat industry to becoming rancher and writing  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:00:30):**  a book defending beef ecological and nutritional case for meat.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:00:34):**  So buckle up if you're vegan or meat eater.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:00:37):**  I hope you enjoy this conversation.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:00:40):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:00:45):**  planet mattered podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:00:49):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:00:54):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:01:00):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:01:02):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:01:06):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:01:09):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:01:14):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:01:18):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:01:22):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.

**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:01:42):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:01:43):**  Today we have the great pleasure to have a rancher and writer who started her research  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:01:48):**  as a lawyer, lobby against the pollution from the meat industry.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:01:51):**  And she was also a committed vegetarian.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:01:53):**  She just released the updated second version of defending beef, the ecological and nutritional  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:01:58):**  case for meat.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:01:59):**  Welcome Nicolette Naima.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:00):**  Good morning.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:01):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:02):**  Actually, it's not morning for you, but it is for me.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:03):**  Hello.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:04):**  And it probably won't be morning when people are listening, but if it's morning when you're  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:07):**  listening, welcome.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:08):**  Thank you so much for taking the time in your morning.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:10):**  I'm very much looking forward to our conversation, but let's start with your story, which for  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:14):**  sure you've told millions of times or many times, but how did you end up working on soil?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:20):**  What brought you to soil?  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:21):**  Yes, it is an unusual path.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:23):**  I was from Michigan in the United States and I studied biology in college and then I went  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:29):**  to law school and I was working as a lawyer.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:32):**  And then I began working for environmental groups.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:35):**  Actually, I heard a speech by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in Michigan, and I was inspired by his  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:43):**  talk to begin trying to work for environmental groups.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:48):**  And I began working for a National Wildlife Federation.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:51):**  And then I actually started working directly for the group that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:02:56):**  in charge of, Waterkeeper in New York.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:03:00):**  And he asked me to work specifically on the meat industry because a lot of what he was  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:03:08):**  seeing around the world, and especially in the United States, was that the concentrated  
**[0:03:12-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:03:12):**  meat industry was causing a lot of pollution, but it was not really being addressed by any  
**[0:03:19-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:03:19):**  of the state or federal government agencies.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:03:22):**  And so this was a very widespread problem that no one was tackling.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:03:26):**  What was the reason it got unnoticed?  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:03:28):**  It's an industry, it's a sector that people had not historically thought of as a large  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:03:33):**  pollution problem.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:03:35):**  But then there's also this sort of political influence of the food industry and of the  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:03:40):**  meat industry and the pharmaceutical industry and the chemical industry, all of the industries  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:03:44):**  that are involved in modern industrial agriculture.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:03:48):**  And so there was really no political will to address this.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:03:52):**  And in fact, of course, many elected officials and so forth had, in the rural states, had  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:03:57):**  a lot of constituents that were either farming or very sympathetic towards farming.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:04:02):**  So the whole idea of trying to regulate farming was not very popular.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:04:06):**  So there was a very significant problem, but there was not any real effort to address it.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:04:13):**  So when I worked for Bobby Kennedy at Waterkeeper, what I was doing was kind of creating a whole  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:04:19):**  approach to trying to tackle the pollution from the concentrated meat industry.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:04:25):**  But very soon into the work, I realized that we were going to be accused of just sort of  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:04:31):**  being against meat.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:04:32):**  And also, I didn't like the idea of just attacking something.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:04:35):**  I really wanted us to help to build something better.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:04:39):**  And so I urged that we should include in the work kind of the supporting and the promotion  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:04:45):**  of the ideas of, at that time, this was 20 years ago, so we weren't using the term regenerative  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:04:50):**  agriculture, but sort of a better form of agriculture.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:04:54):**  So I began working pretty early on in my project there with farmers that were doing a really  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:00):**  good job with caring for the animals and caring for the land.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:03):**  And I visited a lot of those farms, and it was very inspiring.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:07):**  So on the one hand, I was touring large industrial concentrated operations of poultry and pork  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:15):**  and all the sectors, and I was inside a lot of those places.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:19):**  I was also outside a lot of those places, and I was flying over them in small airplanes  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:24):**  to look at the pollution.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:26):**  And on the other hand, I was visiting a lot of farms, really good farms that were doing  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:30):**  a really good job.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:32):**  And the difference could not have been more dramatic.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:34):**  So during the course of that job, I met a lot of the farmers from one particular organization,  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:40):**  which was called Niman Ranch.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:42):**  And I also met the founder of that group, Bill Niman.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:45):**  And after I left the waterkeeper job, I ended up marrying Bill Niman.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:49):**  That's a long story.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:52):**  Just compress it into saying I met him through the work and we ended up getting married.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:57):**  So I moved from New York to California.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:05:59):**  During this time, I was a vegetarian, so it surprised some people that I married a rancher  
**[0:06:05-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:06:05):**  and a meat industry founder.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:06:06):**  He had founded this company, Niman Ranch, which is a network of about 700 farmers and  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:06:12):**  ranchers in the United States.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:06:14):**  And all of them were prioritizing land stewardship and good animal husbandry, and they had created  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:06:20):**  a set of very, very high standards for animal welfare.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:06:25):**  And so, they had a lot of respect and appreciation for the organization.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:06:30):**  But when I moved to the ranch, which is in California, north of San Francisco, I was  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:06:34):**  still a lawyer and a vegetarian, and I just planned on working as an environmental lawyer  
**[0:06:39-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:06:39):**  here.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:06:40):**  But I sort of fell in love with the ranch, and I began working on a daily basis on the  
**[0:06:44-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:06:44):**  ranch.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:06:45):**  And then I did that for seven years, kind of almost full-time work on the ranch.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:06:50):**  During that time, I wrote my first book, which was called Righteous Pork Chop.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:06:55):**  And then I decided I needed to write a book that was specifically defending the importance  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:00):**  of animals in agriculture, and that's the Defending Beef book.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:04):**  And I've just come out, as you mentioned, with a new version of that book, which is  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:08):**  making the argument that animals are incredibly important in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:14):**  And so, we shouldn't be vilifying it.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:16):**  We should be focusing on improving the practices.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:20):**  And do you, I mean, there's so much to unpack there.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:22):**  But do you remember the first time you visited, let's say, one of these, between brackets,  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:28):**  obviously, farmers or farms, was that gradual process?  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:32):**  I always like to dig a bit deeper into these moments that changed, like the speech you  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:35):**  heard, obviously.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:36):**  Was it a gradual process?  
**[0:07:38-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:38):**  Was it a first visit?  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:39):**  Do you still remember?  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:40):**  For sure, you still remember the first time you visited, let's say, a CAFO operation.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:44):**  But you also remember the first time you visited, let's say, the opposite of that.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:48):**  Did that open your eyes?  
**[0:07:50-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:50):**  Did that shock you?  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:51):**  Was it more a process?  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:52):**  Like, after you visited a number of them, you thought, okay, this is not just an anomaly.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:55):**  There are more out there.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:07:56):**  Do you remember that first visit or was it a process?  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:00):**  Well, it kind of both.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:01):**  I mean, I had, because I'd grown up in southwestern Michigan, which has a lot of really good farm  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:06):**  country there, and I had been on quite a few farms as a child.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:09):**  So I didn't grow up on a farm, but I had been on farms fairly, fairly often.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:13):**  You recognized it.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:15):**  I didn't have a negative feeling about farming in general, but I was extremely troubled in  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:23):**  my work as I learned about the industrialized method of raising animals for food.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:28):**  And in fact, the more I learned about that, the more it just reinforced my thinking, well,  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:34):**  I'm so glad I'm a vegetarian.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:36):**  And my initial thought was kind of like, it's a good thing.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:40):**  This is an argument in favor of vegetarianism.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:43):**  So I'd say that's where the big shift happened over the last couple decades in my thinking.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:46):**  But probably the first farm that I really spent time on in the Niman Ranch Network was  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:51):**  Paul Willis's farm in Iowa.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:08:54):**  And he, together with my husband, Bill Niman, founded the network of pig farmers that make  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:00):**  up the Niman Ranch Company.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:02):**  And he has just a lovely part of Iowa and his animals, you can't help but notice that  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:08):**  they're enjoying their lives and you can't help but notice how much life there is on  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:12):**  his farm and how much diversity, how much insect life, how much wildlife.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:18):**  And it was really striking to me how beautiful the place was for the neighbors and for the  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:25):**  community.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:26):**  And even right there in his area, they have a lot of the large concentrated pig operations.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:31):**  And so the contrast was so dramatic.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:33):**  I mean, these were these very industrial scale concentrated.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:36):**  Let's describe them a bit for anybody.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:39):**  We talk about them sometimes on a podcast, but we don't really, I don't think we can  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:42):**  really visualize it.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:43):**  So take us on a visual tour on an audio format.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:47):**  What would you imagine when you say concentrated animal?  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:50):**  So these are basically, they look like, I mean, you know, the form is a little different  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:09:55):**  around the world, but the typical situation is a kind of a large metal windowless building  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:02):**  that looks basically like a warehouse.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:04):**  It could be an Amazon warehouse.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:06):**  But it's not.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:07):**  Yeah, it could be.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:08):**  It's really interesting when you drive by them.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:10):**  I remember when I saw the first buildings of that type, it was in Missouri, actually.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:14):**  If you didn't know what it was, you might not know even that there were animals there.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:18):**  They're very lifeless places.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:20):**  They had, you know, big sort of chain link tall fences, almost like a prison around them.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:26):**  And there was no activity.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:28):**  There were no animals, there were no humans.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:30):**  It was an automated facility that people would stop by a couple times a day to check on things.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:37):**  But a very, you know, on the human kind of environment, and very unnatural to my eye  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:44):**  to be in the middle of a rural area.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:47):**  And so it's something you might drive by without even knowing what it was other than the fact  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:51):**  that there was a tremendous smell, you would often get a very strong odor of a kind of  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:10:56):**  a rotting or sulfuric kind of smell.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:00):**  And that would tip you off.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:02):**  Also, they often had these, especially the pig operations, large open air ponds where  
**[0:11:07-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:07):**  the manure would be liquefied and dumped into.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:10):**  So you know, you could figure out what it is.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:12):**  But if you were just driving by quickly, you might not even notice.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:15):**  Yeah, windows closed and drive by fast, you might not even notice what it was.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:20):**  So but very conflicting with my ideal of a farm that I had grown up with in my mind.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:26):**  And then Paul Willis's farm was pretty much the ideal.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:30):**  It was a place where there were a lot of people there working.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:33):**  There were people out in the fields, there were animals out in the fields, there were  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:36):**  many different he actually has a little prairie restoration part of his farm that he's been  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:41):**  working on for years to reestablish native Iowa prairie.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:45):**  And it's just beautiful.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:47):**  It doesn't smell bad there.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:48):**  There's all kinds of plant life there and wildflowers of all types.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:53):**  And you enjoy being there.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:56):**  You enjoy every minute that you're there.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:11:59):**  It's almost like a life reaffirming process, right?  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:03):**  And you interact with the animals and they're having fun.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:06):**  I remember seeing groups of piglets running around like the way you'd see puppies running  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:10):**  around together in groups and rolling and playing over the months that I, you know,  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:14):**  the first few months when I was at Waterkeeper and I went to a lot of the industrial pork  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:18):**  operations, I never saw anything like that.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:21):**  They don't do that.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:22):**  You know, the animals literally live in kind of joyless, you know, cells on hard surfaces.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:27):**  And it's just a, it couldn't be more different.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:30):**  So that was pretty much right at the beginning of my journey that I had that experience.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:35):**  So I would say pretty early on, I considered there to be a pretty big difference between,  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:40):**  you know, what I would call more traditional agriculture and then the modern industrial  
**[0:12:44-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:44):**  form of it.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:45):**  And let's use the argument that immediately gets thrown usually in this space.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:50):**  Okay, but great, this idealist or ideal farm, but we've created the other ones to feed the  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:12:55):**  world and to create as much protein as possible, and it's more efficient and probably not effective,  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:00):**  but let's use the word efficient here.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:02):**  What is your usual response?  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:04):**  Let's say we're on a stage right now and we do Q&A and somebody asks this question, how  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:08):**  do you respond to that?  
**[0:13:10-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:10):**  How do we feed the world question?  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:11):**  Well, first of all, in the United States, it's important to note that over the hundred  
**[0:13:16-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:16):**  years between 1915 and 2015, there were actually about the same number of pigs on the landscape.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:25):**  So we actually didn't increase the numbers of pigs in the United States that much, only  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:30):**  slightly.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:31):**  It's a very slight difference.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:32):**  It's something like 55 million versus 60 million.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:36):**  So just a small difference.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:38):**  The big difference was where they were living and how.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:41):**  So instead of being distributed widely and living in small groups around the country,  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:47):**  they were living in certain geographies in extremely concentrated populations.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:52):**  And the other point that I think just needs to be emphasized is that whenever someone  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:13:58):**  talks about the feeding world or the efficiency idea, they're really just looking at a very  
**[0:14:04-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:14:04):**  narrow lens and it doesn't consider any of the downstream effects, not just the ecological  
**[0:14:11-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:14:11):**  downstream effects because they're quite significant and measurable for the industrialized situation.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:14:18):**  And there are tremendous benefits to the more traditional, what I would say, sort of the  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:14:24):**  longer, the old, the tried and true method of raising animals, which has a lot of ecological  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:14:28):**  benefits that are very important to compare, but also just even the quality of the food  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:14:32):**  that's produced and the safety.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:14:34):**  So there's a pretty dramatic difference in terms of all those externalized costs or benefits  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:14:40):**  that aren't there or there are there, depending on the method and also the quality of the  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:14:44):**  food and how nourishing that is.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:14:46):**  It's quite different.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:14:48):**  That second piece of it hasn't been as much part of the conversation in my experience,  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:14:52):**  but I think it's beginning to be talked about.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:14:55):**  So we're not producing the same thing.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:14:58):**  It's a very different process.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:15:01):**  And if you are doing animal husbandry well, in what I would call an ecologically sound  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:15:08):**  manner and in a way that gives animals good lives and is really thinking holistically  
**[0:15:13-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:15:13):**  about a farm more as an ecosystem, if you do it well, the animals are not only not bad,  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:15:20):**  they're essential.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:15:21):**  They're an incredibly important part of a regenerative system.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:15:25):**  If you are doing it in the industrialized method, it's more like a mining process.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:15:29):**  You're extracting, you're trying to take something and take it away, and you're not thinking  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:15:36):**  about the farm as an ecosystem that needs to be regenerating itself at all.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:15:40):**  And in fact, it is something that depletes the soil and will pollute the water and reduce  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:15:46):**  the topsoil and everything else.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:15:47):**  So it's not over the longer term, it's much less ecologically sound and not just the safety  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:15:54):**  of the food and the healthfulness of it, but also the eating quality is dramatically diminished.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:15:59):**  So these are things that are beginning to be part of the conversation, but we're not  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:04):**  at that time.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:05):**  Yeah, I think it's, I will link it below, then the Bio-Nutrient Food Association is  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:09):**  launching or launched a big study on beef at the moment globally, the differences between  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:14):**  all the different versions of grass fat and grass finish, the different countries, et  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:18):**  cetera.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:19):**  So I will link it below if anybody's interested in that.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:21):**  And I think it for sure, it shows already because it's based on some very strong research,  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:26):**  the difference in couldn't be more in terms of how animals are raised, but it does raise  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:31):**  the central and of investors that for sure, if they're listening now, they will like to  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:35):**  ask that question, like, is it necessary to have animals in, maybe it even depends on  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:40):**  the ecosystem, but in an ecosystem, is it necessary to have that?  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:43):**  Because we see some farmers now as well, I think they're called themselves the vegan  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:46):**  farming movement that are getting their fertilization from somewhere else.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:50):**  It's always very unclear where, but is it necessary to have the animals in the system  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:16:55):**  as part of the system, even quote unquote, as a tool, maybe we have to decide if we want  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:17:00):**  to eat them or not, that's a separate, could be a separate discussion, but as a tool in  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:17:03):**  ecosystem restoration and regeneration from your experience, obviously bias, but from  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:17:08):**  your experience, is it a crucial tool in that regeneration process that so many landscapes  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:17:13):**  need to go through as we've mined most of them?  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:17:15):**  Yeah, well, I think absolutely.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:17:17):**  And the reason we know that is because if you look at nature and you think of nature  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:17:22):**  as our guiding principle and how it all works and how everything is interconnected and not  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:17:28):**  just, you know, we think about the larger animals on the landscape that we see, but  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:17:32):**  probably even more importantly is what's happening in the soils and throughout the ecosystem,  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:17:38):**  but on the microscopic level.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:17:40):**  And I think the research is fairly new in this arena, but there's more and more research  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:17:47):**  showing that the whole microscopic process that happens in soils that leads to regeneration  
**[0:17:53-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:17:53):**  and leads to not just more carbon in the soil, which is an important biomarker of health  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:00):**  of the system, but you know, how much diversity of microorganism is there?  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:04):**  How much activity is happening in the soil and on the microscopic level?  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:08):**  Right.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:09):**  How much life is happening?  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:10):**  And all of that has been shown to be benefited by the presence of animals.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:15):**  So I think it kind of boils down to the common sense idea that if you want to farm as nature,  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:22):**  you know, to have your farm function the way nature does, which is truly fully regenerative.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:27):**  If that's your guiding principle, then you need animals because there is no ecosystem  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:32):**  on earth that doesn't have animals.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:34):**  And I don't know if that research has been done.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:36):**  I think it's very trivial.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:37):**  What is like in an ideal situation and obviously looking at land, we should dive much deeper  
**[0:18:42-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:42):**  into the ocean literally as well, but let's leave that out for now.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:44):**  What's the carrying capacity in a sense that could we eat the current quantity of animal  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:50):**  protein we're eating, which mostly comes in most places from the wrong side of history,  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:55):**  let's say the CAFO operations, if they would fully switch in this transition, which is  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:18:58):**  going to be messy, et cetera, would we be able to support the same quantity or is there  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:19:03):**  a reduction at least, let's say in the global North of animal protein needed there as well?  
**[0:19:08-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:19:08):**  Like, have you any grasp of the numbers?  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:19:10):**  I mean, you mentioned the pig ones obviously, but is there, has there been research done  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:19:14):**  to that, like in terms of the quantity we could produce in a regenerative way or using  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:19:19):**  regenerative practices or while restoring ecosystems?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:19:22):**  There've been, obviously it's incredibly important to note that all of those kinds of global  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:19:28):**  analyses are not very credible because even I, you know, I point this out all the time,  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:19:34):**  but it's something I really didn't understand until I moved here.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:19:36):**  I mean, I moved to our ranch from New York city, so I was really living in a very urbanized  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:19:41):**  setting and I grew up in a suburban part of Michigan, as I mentioned.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:19:45):**  So I didn't grow up, you know, living on the land every day in the way I do now.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:19:50):**  And I did not really understand this until I lived here, but it is truly the case that  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:19:55):**  everything is so specific in terms of what you're talking about in terms of the land's  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:00):**  capacity to produce something and also how it will best function.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:05):**  So within our own ranch, I see dramatic differences in the different parts of the ranch and there  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:11):**  are dramatic differences for us compared to people down the road from us.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:15):**  I mean, so it is so specific.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:17):**  So every time I hear these global figures, they all have to be taken with a huge grain  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:22):**  of salt.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:23):**  Okay.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:24):**  But that being said, there has been an effort, there've been attempts and I've discussed  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:27):**  it in some of the, in my books, there have been attempts to quantify how much meat you  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:33):**  could produce, how much animal-based foods you could produce.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:36):**  And basically the bottom line is that the number is not really a limiting factor.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:43):**  I mean, I know, like I personally thought, and I probably believe this until the last  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:48):**  few years even, that we would probably have to move towards lower consumption of animal-based  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:54):**  foods, especially as you said in the global north, you know, in sort of the industrialized  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:57):**  world.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:20:58):**  And then there's probably, there is in fact, definitely a need for more animal-based foods  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:03):**  in the developing world from a nutrition and health standpoint.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:07):**  So I sort of bought that argument.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:09):**  I really don't believe that anymore because the more I've studied this issue, the more  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:13):**  I've thought about it, I've realized that the how is everything.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:18):**  It's not about the numbers.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:19):**  It's about how you are managing the animals and how you are managing the whole farm as  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:23):**  an ecosystem.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:25):**  And Gabe Brown in North Dakota says so well, I think, the more animals he added, the more  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:31):**  life he saw on his ranch, the more carbon he saw in his soils, the more diversity he  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:36):**  saw throughout the system, the more nutrients that were found in the food that he was growing.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:41):**  So in his book, you know, dirt to soil is something I think everybody should read.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:46):**  It's just a tremendous book, but he kind of, yeah, he just describes it so well, how animals  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:52):**  didn't take away from the ecosystem they added.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:55):**  And so I think when we have these conversations where we always talk about eat less meat and  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:21:59):**  eat better meat, and I said those things myself, you know, 10 years ago, but I no longer believe  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:22:04):**  it because what I've seen myself with my own eyes, as well as the research I've seen is  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:22:10):**  that if we are managing things from this holistic perspective and thinking about regeneration  
**[0:22:16-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:22:16):**  as the goal, animals are extremely valuable.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:22:20):**  So I don't actually find it compelling at all to believe that we need to reduce our  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:22:24):**  animal based food consumption.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:22:26):**  But that being said, consumers can support the development of these kinds of systems  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:22:33):**  and the growth of these kinds of systems by what kinds of foods they purchase.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:22:37):**  So to the extent that people can afford to, you know, it's very important to purchase  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:22:41):**  foods from a good source.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:22:43):**  And I mean, that affordability is another argument that usually gets thrown immediately,  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:22:47):**  like, yeah, that's easy to say if you live in New York City and you're, let's say you're,  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:22:53):**  you can live in New York City, which means you need a certain standard of living.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:22:56):**  You can buy these things or you can visit a farmer's market or you can order these boxes  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:00):**  now online, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:01):**  The price is always very different compared to the cake operation stuff you find in the  
**[0:23:05-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:05):**  supermarket.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:07):**  It's a very long discussion.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:08):**  Do you have, I wouldn't say an easy answer.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:10):**  What is your standard answer there when somebody throws it out?  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:13):**  Let's say, imagine we're again, we're in the theater on stage and somebody in the Q and  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:17):**  A throws that question onto the stage.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:19):**  What is your normal reaction there?  
**[0:23:21-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:21):**  I mean, I have a few, but I'm very curious about yours.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:23):**  Yeah, the affordability issue is a real issue, but it's kind of a red herring as, you know,  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:29):**  in terms of whether we need to move towards regenerative agriculture, because first of  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:33):**  all, the grocery store price does not really consider all of the costs and all of the benefits  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:39):**  of food production.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:40):**  So we need to, as a society, think about the larger picture when we're discussing this.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:46):**  And you know, I mean, in the United States, for example, in 1950, people spent about 30%  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:51):**  of their income on food.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:53):**  And now today we spend about 9%.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:23:55):**  So one thing that's happened is Americans have just dropped their values as far as how  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:00):**  much we think we should be paying for food and how much it's worth.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:04):**  And I love, you know, Michael Pollan's idea that you pay your farmer now or you pay your  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:09):**  doctor later.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:10):**  It's a long-term investment.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:12):**  Now there are people that genuinely can.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:15):**  So one thing is a lot of like middle-class and upper-class Americans just don't like  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:20):**  paying more for food.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:21):**  It's not really about whether they can afford it or not.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:23):**  Okay.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:24):**  And that's a big point.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:25):**  I know people that are...  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:26):**  How do we get them on board?  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:27):**  Taste?  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:28):**  Well, yeah, I think that's a big part of it.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:30):**  That's what Barbara would say, but yeah.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:33):**  I think flavor is really important.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:34):**  I think it gets underestimated in terms of its importance in a lot of these conversations,  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:37):**  but I think it is really important.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:40):**  And just getting people more thinking in terms of that bigger picture and what the impact  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:44):**  of their purchases are having on all of these systems and then their own health long-term.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:50):**  But a couple other points about the affordability.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:53):**  One is that, you know, this expectation that we expect, what we expect to pay, and I think  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:24:58):**  we do need to shift our expectations about the value of food to our lives, to our daily  
**[0:25:03-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:03):**  enjoyment and to our long-term health.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:05):**  The other is that, you know, my husband, Bill Nyman, is really good about talking about  
**[0:25:10-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:10):**  this.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:11):**  He's a very small animal, and every part of the animal has a different use.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:17):**  And when we know how to cook and we know how to prepare food, and especially meat is one  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:21):**  of these foods, there are very low cost parts of every animal.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:27):**  And those cuts are not only equally and even in some cases more nutritious than the kind  
**[0:25:32-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:32):**  of standard...  
**[0:25:33-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:33):**  They're more tasty.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:34):**  They're much tastier, exactly.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:35):**  So, you know, I've actually, as I returned to meat eating in the last couple of years,  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:39):**  I for the first time really started working on learning how to braise the meat, for example,  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:44):**  and just, you know, that long, slow, low temperature cooking.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:48):**  And it's actually my favorite kind of meat.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:50):**  And so a lot of what I eat and prepare for our own family is some of the cheapest cuts  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:57):**  because they're delicious.  
**[0:25:58-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:58):**  They're very nutritious.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:25:59):**  They're very nourishing and satiating and satisfying.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:04):**  And my mother was very thrifty, and she used to use a lot of that kind of meat.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:07):**  So it actually reminds me a lot of my own childhood.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:09):**  But I think there's a lot to say about affordability.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:12):**  And I think the most important thing is just to recognize it should not be a barrier trying  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:17):**  to create regenerative agriculture because there's always a cost and there's always,  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:23):**  you know, things have to change in order for things to improve.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:27):**  And I think what we're paying for food right now is not a reflection of its true cost.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:31):**  So we really need to, from a societal perspective, put more value on food that's well produced  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:38):**  and then try to make that become the norm.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:41):**  And costs, of course, will come down over time as, you know, if systems move in that  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:45):**  direction.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:46):**  Yeah, I think there's some interesting points there.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:47):**  I will link below.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:48):**  There's a Rockefeller study that came out this year, so 2021, let's see when this interview  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:54):**  will be out, but that estimated the cost of the food system in the US to about three times  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:26:59):**  what the Americans combined pay for their food.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:02):**  And it's based on research and a framework of true cost accounting and a true price foundation.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:08):**  That we just interviewed as well, which should be out whenever you're listening to this with  
**[0:27:12-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:12):**  Pietro and I will put that link below as well.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:14):**  And they show the true price in things, in coffee, in many commodities.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:19):**  And the difference is definitely there, but not crazy.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:22):**  And there are even some shops now experimenting with that.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:25):**  There's a bar that's open, a coffee place that's open in Amsterdam.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:28):**  There's a supermarket where you pay the full price, like mandatory, like that all the prices  
**[0:27:32-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:32):**  are added to it.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:34):**  And they then, of course, it's not a perfect system.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:36):**  They donate to compensate for CO2 and for social costs, et cetera.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:40):**  But at least it makes it very visible on your receipt.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:42):**  Like this is the price you would have paid for these bananas.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:45):**  And this is the cost we added because it's the true cost.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:47):**  So there's that playing with showing the difference.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:50):**  And then in some places you get the option to pay for it if you want extra.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:54):**  In some places actually mandatory.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:55):**  And of course, that raises discussion, like should the government make that mandatory?  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:58):**  Should it sit?  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:27:59):**  I mean, there's a lot of interesting work there on true pricing and true cost accounting  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:04):**  and showing a lot of these things, which to the farm level, probably a lot of the research  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:08):**  isn't there yet.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:09):**  But in general, a lot of these things we know.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:11):**  We know we can do a good estimate, let's say, of all the extra costs that should be counted.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:15):**  And down to a cup of coffee, it's not that much.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:17):**  If you calculate it for the whole coffee industry, it's a lot, obviously.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:20):**  So it's a very interesting movement, which I will link a few things below.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:24):**  And the Sustainable Food Trust has been doing a lot of work in that space.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:28):**  I was very involved in a conference.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:30):**  They did it here in San Francisco called The True Cost of American Food.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:35):**  And that was kind of showcasing that whole idea.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:37):**  So I think that's a great lens with which to think about this issue.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:42):**  And it shows the gap and makes it very visible.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:44):**  To shift gears a bit, why did you decide to update the book?  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:48):**  Because I don't think, correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think the book was published 20 years  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:51):**  ago.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:52):**  Why was it in need of a second edition with quite a bit of extra and deeper thoughts,  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:57):**  et cetera?  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:28:59):**  I think the fact that this issue is so topical and there's been so much new research, everything  
**[0:29:04-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:04):**  from the health side in terms of how our body metabolizes meat and new thinking about a  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:11):**  lot of the existing research on health and nutrition.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:14):**  And then on the ecological side, there has been a ton of new work related to soil carbon  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:20):**  and other things related to methane and climate change.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:23):**  And just throughout the book, I felt it needed more new research because it was happening.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:29):**  And it's just such a topical area.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:30):**  And quite honestly, the publisher, they asked me to do it and I told them I could do it  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:35):**  in a few months.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:37):**  And then I began working on it and I realized, no, actually my own thinking has evolved a  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:41):**  lot and the public conversation has evolved a lot.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:44):**  And as I read the book line by line, there was quite a bit I wanted to change throughout  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:48):**  the book.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:49):**  So it took me about a year to do.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:51):**  And I'm very happy to have had this opportunity because it really reflects my current thinking  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:56):**  and I think the current situation.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:29:58):**  And there's so much conversation about meat right now and especially with respect to climate  
**[0:30:02-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:02):**  change.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:03):**  And I think about 90% of it is not really getting a very deep grasp of the issue at  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:09):**  all.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:10):**  So I was super happy to have the opportunity to kind of infuse my book into the public  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:13):**  conversation that's happening right now.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:16):**  And a shout out to Chelsea Green who reached out to have this conversation and made this  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:19):**  possible and has a lot of other interesting books.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:22):**  I think they published The Dirty Soil as well, right?  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:25):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:26):**  And in fact, I actually went to them when I first wrote the book.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:31):**  It was the only publisher I approached and I said, I have this idea.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:34):**  I want to write this book.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:35):**  And they immediately said yes, because I knew that was the right home for the book.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:38):**  They do wonderful books about sustainability and this whole idea that everything is connected  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:44):**  and that we need to think holistically in terms of everything we do.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:48):**  And that's exactly what I believe.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:50):**  So it's great to have your book in a place where the publisher believes in your book  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:55):**  and understands it.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:30:57):**  Just to be clear, they didn't sponsor this conversation, but they made it possible by  
**[0:31:00-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:00):**  connecting us too.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:02):**  So that's very much appreciated.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:03):**  But we had Judith DeSwards, who published them as well a few times and is a good friend  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:09):**  of the show.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:10):**  So we're close.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:11):**  To shift the conversation to, let's say, the investing or the financing or the money side  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:15):**  of things, imagine still we're on stage, we're doing this live, hopefully that's soon possible  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:20):**  to do these things live again.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:22):**  And we're in a room, let's say we're doing it in New York City, so full of smart impact  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:27):**  investors, smart investors that are looking for a financial return, a fair financial return,  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:31):**  but definitely an ecological and a societal return.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:35):**  And of course, without giving them investment advice, because that's not what we do on this  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:38):**  podcast, but just for educational purposes only, where would you point them in your experience  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:43):**  as a writer, as a lawyer, and of course, as a rancher as well?  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:47):**  What would be places where they, if you would tell them, okay, when you leave this room  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:51):**  after tonight, and so tomorrow morning, you should definitely take a car or plane or whatever,  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:55):**  and go and dig deeper into these areas.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:31:58):**  What are the most exciting places for you where you would point people with, let's say,  
**[0:32:02-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:02):**  a financial background, a financial brain?  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:05):**  Well, there's a lot of interest in supporting soil carbon.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:09):**  So there's, in California here, for example, we have state legislation that is incentivizing  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:15):**  farmers to begin measuring how much carbon they have in their soils and how they can  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:19):**  increase that.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:21):**  And there's a lot of interest in the investment community and in ways to support programs  
**[0:32:25-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:25):**  that are doing that.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:26):**  And I think that's an intriguing idea, and I have nothing against that.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:30):**  But I mean, yes, here's the but.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:32):**  Okay.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:33):**  So the but is carbon is just kind of a biomarker for soil health, for life and how healthy  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:40):**  an ecosystem is.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:41):**  It's really not the end goal.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:43):**  So what I'm interested in, and I actually don't have a specific place to point people  
**[0:32:49-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:49):**  for this, but I'm interested in systems or kind of metrics that will actually measure  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:56):**  ecological health in agricultural operations.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:32:59):**  So it would look, for example, Dr. Jonathan Lundgren, who's a, I don't know if you've  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:33:04):**  had him on your podcast, but he's okay.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:33:06):**  So yeah, exactly fascinating person.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:33:10):**  And he's done these wonderful talks about how whenever we talk about insects and we're  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:33:15):**  just thinking of one particular insect and this is a pest and we have to attack this  
**[0:33:19-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:33:19):**  particular insect, and the same thing could be said of plants, weeds, quote unquote weeds,  
**[0:33:26-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:33:26):**  plants that are undesirable in a particular location.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:33:28):**  So we call them the weeds.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:33:29):**  Whenever we have too much of something, he makes this point really well.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:33:32):**  It just is a system that's out of balance.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:33:35):**  And so he urges that we don't just attack any given undesirable living thing, whether  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:33:41):**  it's an insect or a plant, but that we think about system health and it's all about balance  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:33:47):**  and it's all about diversity.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:33:48):**  And so what I'm interested in is how do we support agricultural systems, whether we're  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:33:54):**  policymakers or consumers or investors, how do we support agricultural systems that are  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:01):**  really trying to create that diversity in agriculture that will create balance using  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:07):**  nature's wisdom and using nature's systems to balance everything out.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:12):**  So for example, if you have an insect that's present in your agricultural system, you would  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:18):**  normally always have other animals and other entities that will reduce the population of  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:24):**  that insect.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:25):**  And you could just think, I mean, we think about it all the time with deer.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:28):**  Deer are massively overpopulated in certain parts of the United States because they've  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:31):**  lost all of their natural predators.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:34):**  And in many cases, hunting is not really allowed or is restricted.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:37):**  So you just see it very much on the landscape, but it's true on the microscopic level and  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:40):**  on the small scale of insects and the plant life as well.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:45):**  When you have a system that's in balance, it's very diverse.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:49):**  We actually have a kind of a living example of this right here right now.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:51):**  We've had tremendous increase in the presence of gophers on our ranch and we have, there's  
**[0:34:58-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:34:58):**  a gopher problem throughout the western part of the United States.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:01):**  And it's largely...  
**[0:35:02-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:02):**  What's a gopher for anybody that lives in the city?  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:04):**  Well, they're sort of ground dwelling rodents and they're really problematic for...  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:09):**  They dig holes.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:11):**  They really destroy a lot of ground because they are down in the root system.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:17):**  So what you need to have a healthy pasture or rangeland is you have to have a lot of  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:21):**  underground activity among the soil and the roots and everything else in the plants.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:27):**  So when you have too many gophers, it's really a problem.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:30):**  But what we've realized, we don't use any poisons or anything at all in our ranch.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:34):**  And we just sort of watched and waited and we found that the number of raptors, we have  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:39):**  a lot of predatory birds here, massive numbers, but it went up pretty dramatically when we  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:45):**  started to see the increase in the gopher population.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:48):**  So nature does this.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:50):**  It balances itself out and we fully expect our gopher problem to be pretty much remedied  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:35:57):**  within the next couple of years by this tremendous population of herons and egrets and hawks  
**[0:36:03-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:03):**  and falcons and kestrels.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:05):**  Everything that's here is always here, but now it's more.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:09):**  For example, we have great horned owls here.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:10):**  We have lots of them on our ranch, but usually we'll see a little clutch of the owls being  
**[0:36:18-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:18):**  born and then you'll see the fledglings coming.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:21):**  You'll see the mother teaching them how to hunt and then they'll kind of distribute,  
**[0:36:25-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:25):**  they'll kind of disperse.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:26):**  You'll just see one or two of them remaining on the ranch.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:29):**  This year, the entire family of great horned owls that was born has stayed here and I'm  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:34):**  convinced it's because of the increase in the gopher population.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:37):**  Right.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:38):**  There's just a wonderful buffet happening out there for them right now.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:41):**  So this is how nature works.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:42):**  It always kind of balances itself out over time and I think that the key to truly creating  
**[0:36:49-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:49):**  a regenerative food system is for us all to understand and to learn about how nature works  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:36:57):**  and balances itself out and to focus on that bigger picture in creating food systems.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:37:03):**  So as we mentioned earlier, there was kind of an extractive mindset with industrialized  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:37:08):**  agriculture where everything was all just about you have inputs which you measure and  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:37:12):**  then you have outputs which you measure and you don't consider any of the downstream effects  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:37:16):**  or any of the things that happen in between and the regenerative mindset is totally different.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:37:21):**  It's thinking about how everything's connected and how everything is related and affects  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:37:25):**  it each other and trying to figure out how to make things balanced and how does the system  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:37:31):**  work to the best and supporting that rather than coming up with sort of silver bullet  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:37:37):**  solutions to every new problem.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:37:39):**  Let's measure carbon.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:37:40):**  I'm thinking of, I don't know who said it, for sure a farmer, like the best way to measure  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:37:45):**  or to see if a landscape is or a farm is moving forward or let's say starting to regenerate  
**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:37:51):**  faster et cetera is to follow the predator behavior of the predators on a farm because  
**[0:37:56-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:37:56):**  they can vote with their feet or with their wings.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:00):**  Because you're basically saying how do we measure the increase of life on a farm, which  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:04):**  for sure we can come up with many different metrics and proxies and biodiversity metrics  
**[0:38:08-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:08):**  on the soil, in the soil, on top of it, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:11):**  But also maybe even the simple, the predator, the quantity and the quality and the diversity  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:16):**  of the predators on a farm is maybe the easiest to measure because you can see them.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:21):**  But maybe it's a proxy for the overall life in the ecosystem, or maybe there are some  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:24):**  other proxies because at the end of the day, we need something relatively easy to measure,  
**[0:38:28-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:28):**  but also something that is a good measurement stick or a good proxy for the life on the  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:32):**  farm and potentially carbon, soil carbon isn't the best way to do that.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:36):**  I mean, it now gets a lot of hype and a lot of money is being added and potentially we  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:40):**  get paid for it, et cetera, et cetera, but it's not the best.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:43):**  It's a biomarker, like you said, not an end goal and maybe life on the farm is an end  
**[0:38:47-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:47):**  goal or it could be an end goal, but then we have to define what the end goal is.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:50):**  But I think it could be very interesting in this case, like if we would have measured,  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:54):**  probably you're doing that, like the quantity of predator birds and the number of species,  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:38:59):**  you can see that uptick over the last years and showing that there is something is happening  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:39:04):**  on the farm or something interesting has happened.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:39:06):**  Well, and there's also the whole question of the food.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:39:08):**  So you've mentioned earlier the research about how much nutrition, how many nutrients of  
**[0:39:13-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:39:13):**  all different types are contained in the food.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:39:16):**  And that's a really important part of this as well that isn't talked about as much, but  
**[0:39:21-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:39:21):**  there are real impacts, not just the sort of ecological health of the system, but of  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:39:24):**  the nutritive value of the food that is produced.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:39:28):**  So that's another way to measure the health of a system, how much nutrition is contained  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:39:33):**  and not just the ones we typically measure.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:39:36):**  But it's a much more complex measurement because you're not just looking at things like vitamin  
**[0:39:42-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:39:42):**  E or calcium or whatever, but you're going to try to look at like Dr. Fred Provenza urges,  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:39:49):**  you know, all the secondary compounds and basically how biologically vibrant the food  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:39:53):**  is, which is, you know, I think the big difference between sort of modern industrial food, which  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:39:58):**  is basically biologically dead and food that's produced in a regenerative system and consumed  
**[0:40:03-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:03):**  close to the source.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:05):**  There were link Fred below as well, but we had then Kittredge multiple times, fascinating  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:10):**  to follow the work of the Bering Nutrient Food Association, Joe Clepperton, who works  
**[0:40:15-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:15):**  a lot with Dan Barber.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:16):**  And there is emerging research, let's say we always knew what you are, what you eat,  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:20):**  et cetera, et cetera, but it's, it always helps when we can, can actually show it in  
**[0:40:25-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:25):**  peer reviewed papers, et cetera.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:26):**  And it's very interesting, the huge variety they find in the quantities of, first of all,  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:32):**  we have to figure out what are the nutrients we actually want to follow, probably a lot  
**[0:40:36-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:36):**  more than we currently measure.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:38):**  And we had an old debate about what we should measure and we don't capture the complexity,  
**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:41):**  et cetera.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:42):**  But yeah, the aliveness of the food is something which is very, very interesting in a time  
**[0:40:46-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:46):**  where we're going through a health crisis after health crisis.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:49):**  And so it's something that I see with the podcast and with all the interest that we've  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:53):**  done is probably one of the most promising, let's say places to dig deeper.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:40:57):**  So if I'm on this stage with you, and I would definitely urge everybody to dive deeper into  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:02):**  that, because this, the whole food as medicine discussion is extremely interesting, extremely  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:07):**  filled with noise, but there's also, there's a lot of very fundamental research being done  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:11):**  on farms right now, as we speak, and that is going to hit us quite, quite hard, I think  
**[0:41:16-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:16):**  over the next year.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:17):**  So that's a good point as well.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:19):**  And what if you would be an investor, let's say you're in charge of a large investment  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:22):**  portfolio, let's say a billion, I used to say a billion was a lot, but then this time  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:26):**  it's not so much anymore, but let's say a lot of money.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:29):**  So a billion dollars and you are free, it could be very long-term investments could  
**[0:41:32-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:32):**  be anything basically.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:34):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:35):**  What would you prioritize in terms of places to put money to work?  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:39):**  Well one thing, I mean, this whole concept we've just been talking about, about creating  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:44):**  farms that are more like ecosystems.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:46):**  I'm not sure exactly what the vector would be to get to that, but that would be an area  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:51):**  I would be looking at.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:53):**  Another thing is just creating more regional food systems, making sure that every region  
**[0:41:59-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:41:59):**  has the ability to produce and consume the food and get it to the consumer.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:03):**  So one of the areas in the United States that we're really lacking in is slaughter and processing  
**[0:42:08-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:08):**  capacity for animals.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:10):**  So I would really look at this.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:12):**  It's completely collapsed in the COVID pandemic, right?  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:16):**  Or at least the industrial side of things.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:17):**  Well there's, yes, that's right.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:20):**  Because the work environments were not safe places.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:24):**  Almost as bad as in the facilities itself, yeah.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:28):**  So a lot of them had to shut down for extended periods of time.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:31):**  And interestingly, a lot of the smaller facilities that were more locally connected and where  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:38):**  the employees were more invested directly, a lot of them are employee-owned, et cetera,  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:43):**  in the smaller regional places, many of them did not ever have to shut down.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:47):**  I know a lot of the Nymn ranch farmers that I spoke with were not affected by the COVID  
**[0:42:53-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:53):**  shutdowns.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:54):**  They did really well, actually.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:55):**  They were sold out until 2023.  
**[0:42:57-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:58-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:58):**  Exactly.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:42:59):**  So it was a really different scenario.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:43:01):**  But that physical infrastructure for the sort of the slaughter and the processing of it's  
**[0:43:05-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:43:05):**  lacking now because the larger slaughter companies purchased a lot of the local slaughterhouses  
**[0:43:13-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:43:13):**  and shut them down.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:43:14):**  And we need these.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:43:15):**  We need regional facilities so that the smaller independent farmers and ranchers can get their  
**[0:43:21-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:43:21):**  animals to consumers.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:43:24):**  And so that's that little there's a big bottleneck in the slaughter and processing infrastructure.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:43:29):**  So that's something I would definitely look at if I were in charge of my local is does  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:43:34):**  it need to be in terms of what's the research around quality?  
**[0:43:38-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:43:38):**  Like how is a very difficult question.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:43:41):**  But how far does because a lot of these animals currently have to travel very far in very  
**[0:43:45-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:43:45):**  stressful situations, which I can't imagine helps with the quality of the end protein.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:43:52):**  How local does local need to be?  
**[0:43:54-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:43:54):**  Everything needs to be slaughtered in a perfect world on the farm itself or like is half an  
**[0:44:00-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:00):**  hour OK?  
**[0:44:01-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:01):**  What is your experience there in terms of when do you start to really lose quality because  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:05):**  of the distance and the freshness basically and the stress and the whole environment?  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:10):**  Those are all exactly those are the considerations you're looking at.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:14):**  How far do you need to transport the animal?  
**[0:44:16-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:16):**  How fresh will it be, etc.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:18):**  And there's a real animal welfare concern when you're transporting animals.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:21):**  So it really depends on the species.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:24):**  But I would say in general, I'm not that interested in local food systems, but I'm interested  
**[0:44:29-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:29):**  in regional food systems.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:30):**  So I think I mean, the United States, of course, is a really big country and we drive long  
**[0:44:35-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:35):**  distances to do everything.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:38):**  And we think nothing of it.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:39):**  But I would say ideally you wouldn't want to transport your animals more than a couple  
**[0:44:44-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:44):**  of hours drive away.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:46):**  That would be kind of the outer limit.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:48):**  And so we need to sort of look, you know, I just think of regional food sheds and think,  
**[0:44:53-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:53):**  do we have what we need in this area for?  
**[0:44:56-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:44:56):**  And of course, what is being raised on the land is quite different depending on where  
**[0:45:01-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:01):**  you are.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:02):**  And I don't think there's anything wrong with transporting meat.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:05):**  You know, meat is a incredibly nutrient rich food that is very beneficial to human health.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:13):**  And so it's worth it to transport things.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:17):**  I mean, I get a little freaked out when I hear that we're flying raspberries places  
**[0:45:22-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:22):**  and things like that.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:23):**  I mean, I think there's tremendous inefficiency in terms of the transport of food.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:27):**  But meat is one of those foods for fish, all of the sort of animal proteins.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:33):**  These are things that are worth transporting because of how much nourishment they provide  
**[0:45:38-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:38):**  to people.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:39):**  And so I think when we're thinking about regional food sheds, we want to make sure that we can  
**[0:45:46-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:46):**  process the animals that are located in that region.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:50):**  And then, you know, for example, you look at New York City, obviously you're going to  
**[0:45:53-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:53):**  have to bring meat in from farther away.  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:56):**  But it's worth doing that.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:45:57):**  It's maybe not worth flying greens across the country in the middle of the winter.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:02):**  That's a very interesting point you're making in terms of I think we, the food miles shouldn't  
**[0:46:07-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:07):**  be only food miles, but also almost nutritional miles.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:10):**  Like what are transporting per kilo per tonne?  
**[0:46:13-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:13):**  And in many cases of fruits and vegetables, it's mostly water and sugar.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:17):**  And so is that worth it?  
**[0:46:18-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:18):**  Or are we allowed to transport and burn a lot of CO2 and other emissions in that process?  
**[0:46:23-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:23):**  And so where is that limited or where, where's the sweet spot?  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:26):**  And yeah, obviously the more nutrition dense per kilo per gram you are, the more you should  
**[0:46:31-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:31):**  be allowed to travel and still limited as much as possible.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:34):**  But yeah, the processing and probably that's the same, but actually with many other things,  
**[0:46:38-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:38):**  the processing should be as quick and as local as possible to keep a lot of these things  
**[0:46:43-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:43):**  in.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:44):**  But then the transport depends on the form and shape, et cetera.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:46):**  Because at the end, we're mostly transporting water, which is, which is a bit of a waste  
**[0:46:50-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:50):**  of energy.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:52):**  And there's just that whole question of how you measure, you know, sort of the ecological  
**[0:46:56-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:56):**  impact of different foods.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:46:58):**  Dr. Michael Lee in the UK has made the argument that, and I think it's really sensible, that  
**[0:47:04-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:04):**  when you're thinking about the sort of the climate change impact of different foods,  
**[0:47:08-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:08):**  you need to consider how much nourishment that food provides and think about it in terms  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:13):**  of that, how much emission versus how much nourishment.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:17):**  And so when you do that, his research is really interesting to me because it shows that beef  
**[0:47:21-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:21):**  in particular is very beneficial to transport because it actually provides a great deal  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:29):**  of nutrient value, nutrition to people.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:33):**  And when you look at the climate change impact in that lens, beef is quite low.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:38):**  It's really interesting.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:39):**  It's the conversation I think is, again, we need to dig, not we, but society needs to  
**[0:47:44-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:44):**  be having more conversations about that.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:45):**  Yeah, that's super interesting.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:47):**  That definitely I will try to find it and link it below.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:49):**  Otherwise I'll get back to you on Michael Lee, you said right in the UK.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:52):**  I think I've seen some of those graphs, but I need to link them below just to make them.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:47:58):**  He's done some talks where he shows some good graphics.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:00):**  And I've met him as well when I was speaking for Sustainable Food Trust in the UK in 2019.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:07):**  So I heard him speak in person and met him and I've seen a couple of his talks online.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:10):**  So he's got some good stuff out there.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:12):**  Great.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:13):**  And this is a question I definitely, I wouldn't say stole, but borrowed from John Kempf, who  
**[0:48:17-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:17):**  was asked in his podcast, likely differently, but where are you contrarian?  
**[0:48:21-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:21):**  I mean, we've heard a few things.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:22):**  Maybe it's the not reduction of meat part.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:25):**  Maybe it's something else.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:26):**  When you go to these conferences, where do you think very differently?  
**[0:48:30-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:30):**  Where are you contrarian towards your peers, towards the other regenerative ag, regenerative  
**[0:48:35-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:35):**  ranching, et cetera, people?  
**[0:48:36-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:36):**  Where do you feel like, oh, actually there I'm quite contrarian here?  
**[0:48:40-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:40):**  Well, I guess a couple of ways.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:41):**  One is, yes, definitely this question of whether we should be reinforcing this idea that we  
**[0:48:46-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:46):**  need to eat less meat.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:48):**  That's something that I hear.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:49):**  And as I said, I've said it myself in the past.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:52):**  I no longer believe that because I see this tremendous power of well-managed animals to  
**[0:48:58-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:48:58):**  regenerate landscapes and to regenerate soils and ecosystems.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:02):**  So I no longer agree with that message at all.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:06):**  And another part of, this is not exactly contrarian, but it's quite different.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:10):**  I've often seen, I've been to a lot of agricultural conferences and ecological conferences over  
**[0:49:16-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:16):**  the years, and I'm always shocked how little people are talking about the food, not just  
**[0:49:22-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:22):**  the nutritional value, but the eating quality, the enjoyment.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:27):**  Sometimes it is.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:28):**  Right.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:29):**  Yes.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:30):**  That's a whole nother problem.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:31):**  It's often the, you know, sort of basically just industrial food that you'll get at these  
**[0:49:35-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:35):**  conferences, which is very ironic, but because it's the cheapest, you know, so it's just  
**[0:49:39-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:39):**  like everybody else.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:40):**  And you're in a conference setting and you might have a few stands of a few companies  
**[0:49:44-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:44):**  where you can snack something better, interestingly enough, but you're right.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:47):**  It's very little about the food.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:48):**  But I think we need to have the food and how much importance it has for us as humans to  
**[0:49:54-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:49:54):**  be eating food that is enjoyable and that we sit around a table eating together.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:01):**  I mean, food is so much more than just the output of an agricultural system.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:07):**  You know, food has this tremendous cultural importance.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:11):**  And in fact, I just saw recently, somebody posted on Facebook, well, meat is just eating  
**[0:50:15-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:15):**  meat is a cultural thing.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:16):**  And I thought to myself, well, first of all, it's not true.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:18):**  But second, even if it were, why does that make it unimportant?  
**[0:50:22-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:22):**  Culture is everything.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:23):**  Right.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:24):**  That's supposedly what distinguishes us from the rest of the living creatures on the planet.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:28):**  We have culture, right?  
**[0:50:30-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:30):**  We have a long history of knowing who we are and passing down traditions and stories and  
**[0:50:35-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:35):**  things.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:36):**  And that's what culture is.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:38):**  And food is an incredibly important part of culture.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:42):**  So I think the idea that food is nourishing to our culture and to our bodies and to our  
**[0:50:48-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:48):**  souls, that's a really important part of the conversation that I almost never see when  
**[0:50:53-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:53):**  I go to a conference.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:50:55):**  And if you could change one thing overnight, like you have a magic wand and you can change  
**[0:51:00-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:51:00):**  one thing in the food, agriculture or in general, honestly, it could be anything.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:51:04):**  What would you change?  
**[0:51:05-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:51:05):**  Well, having been inside a lot of these industrial animal operations, they are places that if  
**[0:51:12-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:51:12):**  you have any kind of concern about animals, you cannot consider them morally acceptable.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:51:19):**  So to me, having been in a lot of these places and seen how just terrible they are, I would  
**[0:51:26-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:51:26):**  immediately, if I could do one thing, I would get the animals back outside, get them out  
**[0:51:32-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:51:32):**  of their cages, get them off of the hard floors, let the animals be able to walk around, breathe  
**[0:51:38-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:51:38):**  fresh air, be in the sunshine.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:51:40):**  That would be the single biggest sweeping change I would want to see overnight in the  
**[0:51:45-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:51:45):**  food system.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:51:46):**  And I believe over time we are going to get there because the more people have seen what  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:51:51):**  these places look like, the more people understand how wrong they are.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:51:56):**  And it's a tricky one, but what would you then, let's say we're again on stage and somebody,  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:01):**  you were a committed vegetarian, what would you say to the vegetarian movement or even  
**[0:52:06-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:06):**  the vegan movement as well?  
**[0:52:08-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:08):**  That often we, I see it in a lot of online conversations and in general as well, it often,  
**[0:52:13-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:13):**  let's say the regenerative ranchers, especially the people that use animals, use between brackets,  
**[0:52:19-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:19):**  use animals in regenerating soils.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:22):**  Somehow we get into a lot of discussions, or we, I'm not having animals, but we as a  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:26):**  movement get into a lot of discussions with the vegan side of things, with vegetarians.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:32):**  And personally, I think it's just a distraction from the real issue, which is industrial scale  
**[0:52:38-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:38):**  extractive agriculture.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:39):**  And I think for them, it's perfect that we're getting a lot of discussions because it's  
**[0:52:42-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:42):**  just delay, delay, delay.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:44):**  But what do you feel when that happens?  
**[0:52:46-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:46):**  When because something, let's say somebody very passionate stands up in the audience  
**[0:52:49-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:49):**  and say, we should just stop eating meat or stop killing animals for food.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:53):**  What do you tell, except that they should read the book and they should do a lot more  
**[0:52:57-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:57):**  research, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:52:58):**  What is your general response when you get a question like that or a statement?  
**[0:53:02-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:53:02):**  Usually it's not a question.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:53:03):**  Well I do, I actually have encountered that many times.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:53:06):**  So I think the bottom line is that every form of food production causes the loss of life.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:53:14):**  And if you're just thinking that killing an animal for food is killing, and if you're  
**[0:53:20-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:53:20):**  eating, not eating animals that you're not engaging in killing, then you're not really  
**[0:53:24-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:53:24):**  looking at agriculture and understanding how agriculture works.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:53:27):**  So I had this kind of revelation to myself years ago when I was working in my garden  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:53:33):**  and I was just sort of clearing away the growth that had come in over the winter.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:53:37):**  Because it's in California, we don't have everything die off during the winter.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:53:40):**  Like where I'm from in Michigan, everything just dies in your garden and then you start  
**[0:53:44-0:53:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:53:44):**  afresh.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:53:45):**  But here we have to pull everything out.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:53:47):**  And as I was doing that, I saw all these tiny little webs and nests and it was a whole little  
**[0:53:55-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:53:55):**  microscopic kind of ecosystem, not quite microscopic, but a small scale ecosystem that I was just  
**[0:54:00-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:54:00):**  destroying by getting the garden ready just to plant vegetables in it.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:54:04):**  So it was a completely vegan place, but I was causing just mayhem, death and destruction.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:54:11):**  It was like I was the force of the apocalypse coming to this little piece of land that I  
**[0:54:16-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:54:16):**  was going to put my seeds into.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:54:18):**  And actually that moment has affected the way I guarded too.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:54:23):**  I've thought a lot about this over the years and I've really moved away from the classic  
**[0:54:27-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:54:27):**  sort of clearing your ground and putting the seeds in in the spring.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:54:29):**  I don't do that anymore.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:54:30):**  But in any event, every type of food causes death and causes ecological impact and harm.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:54:39):**  And if you're just not seeing it because you're not seeing the plowing of the ground destroying  
**[0:54:44-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:54:44):**  the snake habitat and killing the mice and killing all of the other animals that live  
**[0:54:49-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:54:49):**  in the ground and you're not paying attention or ignoring the fact that rodents and deer  
**[0:54:54-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:54:54):**  and everything are being killed to prevent them from eating your vegetable or fruit crop,  
**[0:54:59-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:54:59):**  you can do that if you want.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:55:00):**  But the reality is there is a killing that's going to happen for your food.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:55:06):**  And so to me, it's just ignoring that if you're saying you're, quote unquote, eating compassionately  
**[0:55:12-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:55:12):**  because you're not eating meat.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:55:14):**  So the bigger question, I think, is are we getting our food from systems that are more  
**[0:55:21-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:55:21):**  like ecosystems?  
**[0:55:22-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:55:22):**  And those are supporting life of all types, whether it's animal or vegetable or fungal.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:55:29):**  And I think that should be the focus.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:55:31):**  And this idea of do you have meat or no meat on your plate is almost irrelevant in terms  
**[0:55:36-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:55:36):**  of whether or not you're being humane in terms of how you eat.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:55:41):**  I think you could almost argue, I'm not sure if I'm getting emails about this, but that  
**[0:55:46-0:55:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:55:46):**  by, if let's say you're consuming a lot of industrial grown grains and a lot of industrial  
**[0:55:53-0:55:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:55:53):**  grown or extractively grown, but still on the label, it says vegan, like you could almost  
**[0:55:59-0:56:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:55:59):**  argue that you're causing more harm depending how you calculate the amount of lives.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:03):**  Of course, let's say a cow is very different from a mice, but you do cause so much harm  
**[0:56:09-0:56:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:09):**  with that.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:10):**  I mean, we haven't done that calculation, but you could, like the quantity is almost  
**[0:56:13-0:56:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:13):**  more than if you would eat directly meat.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:15):**  Like it's an indirect cause, but yeah, you can close your eyes for that.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:19):**  But there's an enormous destruction going on to produce all of that, plus all the fertilizer  
**[0:56:23-0:56:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:23):**  and plus all the stuff that has to be produced to produce that.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:27):**  And there have been some articles that have argued that very point with some real credible  
**[0:56:33-0:56:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:33):**  research in them.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:34):**  But I think it's impossible to precisely quantify again, cause everything is so different.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:42):**  So it's just, I think it's just the general idea that people have to accept agriculture  
**[0:56:46-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:46):**  is going to have an impact.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:48):**  And the key point is, is the system that you're getting your food from and your different  
**[0:56:54-0:56:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:54):**  foods, I mean, most of us probably get it from a lot of different sources.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:56:56):**  I know I do, but are all those places where you're buying your food from, are they trying  
**[0:57:02-0:57:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:02):**  and focusing on this whole idea of soil health and ecological health?  
**[0:57:08-0:57:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:08):**  And are they making the process one that is compatible with the natural landscape function  
**[0:57:14-0:57:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:14):**  that's supposed to be in that place where the food is coming from?  
**[0:57:17-0:57:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:17):**  And that conversation is almost never happening in the vegan setting.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:21):**  In fact, I have never seen it.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:24):**  Let's invite them here.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:25):**  I mean, we had one very interesting, I will link it below as well, a vegan cheesemaker  
**[0:57:29-0:57:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:29):**  in Amsterdam who they did an LCA on their cashew nut cheese and found out that it was  
**[0:57:35-0:57:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:35):**  definitely better than industrial cheese, extractive cheese, but it wasn't as good as  
**[0:57:38-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:38):**  they hoped.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:39):**  And so they were switching ingredients to beans that are grown in the Netherlands instead  
**[0:57:43-0:57:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:43):**  of cashew nuts that come from far, that use a lot of natural gas or this fossil gas to  
**[0:57:47-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:47):**  be cleaned and processed, et cetera.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:49):**  And they were quite shocked on the LCA and they were saying, we're probably one of the  
**[0:57:52-0:57:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:52):**  few, unfortunately in Europe of the alternative cheese makers that actually looked at their  
**[0:57:57-0:58:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:57:57):**  ingredients and did some analysis of where they come from, what impact they had.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:58:01):**  And let's say the potential positive side of things was way lower than they would have  
**[0:58:05-0:58:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:58:05):**  hoped as a very ambitious vegan startup.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:58:09):**  And they are changing their whole recipe, which is an interesting journey and working  
**[0:58:13-0:58:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:58:13):**  with dairy farmers to plant these types of beans and to actually start a rotation in  
**[0:58:18-0:58:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:58:18):**  them.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:58:19):**  And so there's an interesting discussion there on, there's a fundamental discussion there  
**[0:58:22-0:58:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:58:22):**  on ingredients.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:58:23):**  So I will link that in the view below.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nicolette-hahn-niman#t=0:58:25):**  But thank you so much, Nicoletta, for your time this morning.

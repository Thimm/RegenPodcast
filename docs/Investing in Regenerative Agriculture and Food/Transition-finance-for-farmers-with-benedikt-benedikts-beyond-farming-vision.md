**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative  food and agriculture, follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com  slash course, or in the links below now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:24):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture and food.  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  Why are we recording this series?  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:33):**  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the  gurus on their farms, explored farm size regenerative designs, and most importantly  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:45):**  started their pilots and feedback loops.  This is where transition finance is key.  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:54):**  flexibility and the farmer's lack of collateral. Furthermore, there's a limit  of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give away.  That is why my cohost aspiring to be regenerative farmer, Benedict  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:07):**  Boesel and I are embarking on a journey to find out what are the key principles  of transition finance for regenerative farmers.  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:18):**  agriculture and food finance space.  They shared our insights, how they would finance the speed up after regenerative  transition on Benedict's 1000 hectares, which is almost two and a half thousand  
**[0:01:29-0:01:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:29):**  acres farm in Germany, close to Berlin.  This is an open process.  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:37):**  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other  inspiration, people to interview, et cetera, get in touch via the contact page  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:48):**  on the website, investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  That is investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  I want to ask you a bit on the vision of the farm, but actually beyond the farm,  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:01):**  because you look in general, you look beyond things.  So you found it is a good imbecile.  Can you explain a bit what that is and what your beyond farming vision entails?  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:12):**  Yeah, for sure.  Basically, so the idea is because we are situated one hour east of Berlin, we  obviously have quite a good connectivity for people that, you know, who are  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:25):**  interested in those kinds of questions that we work on.  And as I said, like, you know, I believe that the role of us as farmers is far  beyond what we today think of, you know, it's not only primary production, it is,  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:39):**  and it can be so many more fascinating things.  So we have a, well, we framed a name, so to say, for that concept, which we call  beyond farming, which really consists of three different parts.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:50):**  It's as beyond sustainability, which is of course, you know, the whole idea of  saying, well, we don't want to just sustain, you know, we want to make it better.  So we find, or we're looking for different forms of multifunction land use models  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:05):**  and bring them here on our challenging environment with a low precipitation and  the sandy soil, test them here, develop them here and see how they can be done  in a way that they are socially, ecologically and economically, let's say,  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:20):**  beneficial.  So that is one part, bring in those different, you know, lines of thought, I  guess, from regenerative agriculture, just to show, you know, what is possible and  
**[0:03:30-0:03:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:30):**  what not.  On a large scale, like a large commercial farm, I think that's often forgotten  because often this research is done and it's not just a commercial farm, it's  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:40):**  either in universities or other places that maybe don't have to focus on  profitability or need to have it because I mean, you have people to pay or you  have people to pay.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:48):**  So there's this interesting, the farm as a platform or the land as a platform, but  within certain boundaries and certain, I mean, within the normal, let's say  farming between brackets, normal farming system.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:00):**  Yeah.  I mean, that's a good point.  I think, you know, in order to really be part of a paradigm that is being changed  
**[0:04:08-0:04:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:08):**  or to work into that, we can only make sure that it is applicable if we can  scale it and if it is economically feasible, right?  So you can think about ecological and social benefits all you want.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:24):**  You need to find obviously a way that you can as a farmer earn good income from  it and be sustainable from an economic point of view.  So yeah, you're absolutely right.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:34):**  I mean, I think, you know, you have to bring it into the real context of being  included or like a big part of running the farm or being, you know, the farm  business.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:46):**  So yeah, we will try to scale it up.  At the same time, obviously there's, you know, so much knowledge to be captured,  so much, let's say learnings to be made that, you know, a way for us is also to  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:00):**  have people come in that either are skilled in that area already or that,  let's say, do a monitoring of it, be it NGOs, be it scientific groups, be it  universities, to make sure that you can actually capture all the experience and  
**[0:05:18-0:05:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:18):**  the learnings that you see.  And I mean, there's just so many, right?  Sorry, I interrupted your beyond the three points of beyond.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:26):**  We are still beyond sustainability.  Yeah, I was going to come back to that.  But thank you for that.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:31):**  No, so that's really, you know, that's the whole beyond sustainability part.  Then on another note, we always say beyond food, because I think to bring in,  let's say the public, to bring in also politicians, to bring in many people who  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:46):**  are often, you know, talking about agriculture, let's say without really  being aware of it in that instance, or who talk about food, but don't think about  agriculture, I think you, it's always important to find a good, like you have  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:02):**  to speak their language, right?  And coming too much, let's say from the agriculture angle, I think many are not  yet there to understand that link between the two.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:11):**  So when we have guests, when we have visitors, when we are somewhere invited  to talk somewhere, then we always come from, let's say the food angle.  And so, yeah, start the conversation on food and then move them into agriculture  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:25):**  and try to establish a feeling of why the two are so strongly interconnected,  why soil health has to do with plant health, human health, animal health.  And I think it's a good way of starting a conversation and making people  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:40):**  interested about, you know, agriculture as such, because it is so strongly linked  to emotions that you always have to find a way how they can open themselves up  for something that...  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:51):**  And start a discussion without polarizing it immediately.  Exactly.  Because you lose people very quickly, which, or farmers in general, I mean,  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:00):**  you lose people in general very quickly in these topics, especially on animal  agriculture, especially on GMOs, especially on the big chemical companies.  I mean, they're very rightfully so very touchy subjects.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:13):**  Yeah, absolutely.  But food is something we all do.  So, yeah, it's a great way, a great segue into not starting to talk about soil  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:22):**  immediately, which we usually do.  But maybe it's not the best way, it's maybe to start to talk about food and how  that came from soil and the importance and the challenges and the opportunities.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:33):**  Yeah, exactly that.  And I think, you know, when we have visitors or friends even here, one of the  first things I always say is that I want them to be as honest and open as they  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:44):**  possibly can, because I tell them what I think and I tell them, you know, all my  thoughts and ideas and feelings and whatnot.  And, you know, if you have people visiting and them not being open, not asking  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:57):**  questions, even if they think, you know, it might be a question that I don't want  to hear, you will never touch those points, those emotions that you actually  need to touch upon if you want to get into a real discussion and if you even  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:09):**  might want to change something either in yourself or in the one you're talking to.  So, and I think food is something where, you know, you can find that level quite  easily and then move on to more complicated matters.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:24):**  So that's that part.  And the third is basically what we call beyond business or beyond farm business,  really, because being, let's say, an actor in the rural area and obviously having,  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:37):**  let's say, the land that you're managing, the forest that you're managing, a lot of  infrastructure that goes with it, you know, it's also there.  It's not only primary production.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:47):**  Like we always understand ourselves also as a platform.  So we work together with different startups that we, you know, assign certain  fields from, or we use the technology or use their product.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:58):**  So we try to bring in some value for them.  At the same time, basically we lease land to a couple that are starting a market  garden now, and then the land that we're leasing is for us actually not too good to  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:14):**  cultivate, but for them it's everything, right?  So there's huge potential in that.  And also there's some synergies, but it goes beyond that.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:21):**  It goes through basically educating people, right?  I mean, you could invite schools, you can invite other kids to say, look, you know,  just use the land for educating, use the land for all kinds of things.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:37):**  And it either goes beyond that and thinking about art, think about, yeah,  different alternative models of...  Tell me about the gigantic root system that you had arrived on your farm as part of an art project.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:56):**  Yeah, I'll upload a photo of that.  But basically, so we have this, basically the area where we live here and where we  farm is pretty much where the war ended.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:05):**  And so all the old oak trees, I mean, they have seen it all in a way.  And next year in spring, we're celebrating the 75th anniversary of the ending of the war.  For the internationalism, the Second World War we're talking about.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:21):**  Exactly, exactly.  And we met this artist who's always been involved in history, German history, and also working  with wood.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:30):**  And I said, man, what do you think about doing something together?  I would love to do some sort of art project.  And so we thought about that idea and went back and forth.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:39):**  And he said, don't you have an old root of an oak?  And I was like, yeah, of course, we have plenty of those.  So we found this huge oak root, which is, I don't know, five, six metres wide.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:53):**  And the tree is estimated to be around 200 years old.  So basically, we took it out of the earth and carried it on the estate.  And now it's there to dry.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:06):**  And next year, we're hoping to be able to put it in front of the, or on the stairs of  the Reichstag in Berlin.  And the art curatorium of the Bundestag will discuss it and think about it in January,  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:21):**  I think.  Which is the parliament building of Berlin.  That would be a nice symbol, getting the roots.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:29):**  I've seen it.  We'll put a picture.  It's absolutely massive.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:33):**  And as it should be, it's a 200 plus year old tree.  But it's very impressive to see the full or a big part of the root system above ground  and not in the soil.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:42):**  Yeah, I mean, it's incredible.  And I think also, the root is something that many people often don't think about.  And if you see that structure, I mean, it's just fascinating.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:54):**  It's really changing your look on things.  And I think that is really something that we have to do on such a great scale.  And that is, I think, why art takes or has to have such a huge part of that whole discussion  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:05):**  we have today about changing the way we think about ecosystems, changing the way we think  about certain, let's say, economic processes, the set up of companies.  I mean, that is all somehow involved with the horizon, at least of the...  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:21):**  I think in terms of art and education, there's an enormous role to make things visible, like  the root system, to make region X visible, to make the damages of the current ecosystem  visible, to make the potential and the imagination.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:34):**  I think there's a huge role for that.  And something with the aesthetics of things and the taste of things, I think are very  closely connected and make all of these discussions just a lot easier and a lot more fascinating,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:49):**  honestly.  I want to shift gears to, we're going to be extremely practical.  We're going to unpack a bit the farm.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:58):**  And we already mentioned a few things, but I want to start with a question actually.  Why are you spending your time on a Friday afternoon to start on what could be quite  an extensive journey to explore transition finance, not only for your farm, but actually  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:12):**  the principles of transition finance for many other farmers, let's say in Europe, but also  actually outside Europe.  What made you choose to take on next to all the farming, the root systems we discussed  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:24):**  before to take on another project?  That's a good question and one that I've heard before, I guess.  But when it comes to this podcast and the whole question of transitioning finance, I  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:36):**  think there's so many young people, there's so many progressive thinkers, there's so many  progressive farmers that are realising the situation that they're in.  Obviously there's some that are fighting to somehow stay alive, not only the farm, but  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:54):**  the families, the work, the passion that they have, the love that they have for farming.  And I think those are confronted with incredible problems and incredible, let's say, tasks  ahead.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:06):**  So there's that whole group of people who are pretty much forced to find a new way.  I mean, they are running out of options and I think for them transition financing in a  way that still gives them enough flexibility, that gives them enough freedom, that gives  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:21):**  them the chance, also, let's say from a psychological point, really, time to adapt, time to think  about new ways, time to widen the horizon.  I think that is a huge area for people who are passionate about agriculture.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:38):**  And they really need it.  So that's one part.  And I think another part is of people saying and realising, wow, there is this whole new  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:46):**  paradigm of agriculture, a new paradigm of coping with agricultural land, of cultivating  land.  There's a whole new meaningfulness of doing agriculture.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:57):**  And I want to get involved.  I have me and my friends, I don't know, want to get involved.  How do we do that?  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:03):**  How can we get into that?  How can we start?  How can we, you know, get going?  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:08):**  So for those people and those potential also new farmers, I think they are exactly at that  point where they say, well, how can I actually start?  Because not having the land, not being in that industry already, it's close to impossible  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:23):**  to get going.  And then there's a third group, which I guess I kind of consider myself part of, that is,  you know, already farming, maybe also faced with a couple of potential difficulties, but  
**[0:15:37-0:15:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:37):**  also incredibly interested to develop further, to go new ways and at the same time seeing  the incredible potential of it.  But at the same time having a certain responsibility towards employees, towards family, towards  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:54):**  maybe oneself, but also obviously towards the land.  And I think that group is also saying, well, you know, we've read all the books.  We know, let's say the characteristics, we see the potential, we want to do it.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:07):**  We believe we can, you know, hit a market.  Yeah, we've done the pilots.  We're ready to go.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:13):**  But you know, obviously there's incredible risks involved.  So I guess there's three different kinds of groups.  There's probably many more, but like for me, there's like the large groups, which are all  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:24):**  capable and willing to move into that.  And just because, yeah, there's so many people considering it, but all of which have to kind  of go in unused waters.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:39):**  How do you say it?  Untapped waters.  And unknown waters.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:42):**  Yeah.  But still, I mean, it comes back to, it still doesn't mean you have to do this.  I want to definitely thank you for your time and that we're going to explore.

Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:36):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:46):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question,  how to put money to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:59):**  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  How have we built our decision-making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:07):**  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:13):**  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space for whom is this course?  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:20):**  You the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:34):**  miners, holistic management, consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:46):**  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  et cetera.  Is this course free?  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:53):**  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning, I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:00):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:11):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:16):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:30):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:41):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:55):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:00):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:11):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.  Click on the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

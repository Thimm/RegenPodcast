**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative  
**[0:00:03-0:00:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:03):**  food and agriculture, follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com  
**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:09):**  slash course, or in the links below now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:24):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:27):**  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:31):**  Why are we recording this series?  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:33):**  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:36):**  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:40):**  gurus on their farms, explored farm size regenerative designs, and most importantly  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:45):**  started their pilots and feedback loops.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:47):**  This is where transition finance is key.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:50):**  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:54):**  flexibility and the farmer's lack of collateral. Furthermore, there's a limit  
**[0:00:59-0:01:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:59):**  of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give away.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:03):**  That is why my cohost aspiring to be regenerative farmer, Benedict  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:07):**  Boesel and I are embarking on a journey to find out what are the key principles  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:12):**  of transition finance for regenerative farmers.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:15):**  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:18):**  agriculture and food finance space.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:20):**  They shared our insights, how they would finance the speed up after regenerative  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:24):**  transition on Benedict's 1000 hectares, which is almost two and a half thousand  
**[0:01:29-0:01:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:29):**  acres farm in Germany, close to Berlin.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:32):**  This is an open process.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:33):**  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:37):**  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:39):**  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:44):**  inspiration, people to interview, et cetera, get in touch via the contact page  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:48):**  on the website, investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:51):**  That is investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:57):**  I want to ask you a bit on the vision of the farm, but actually beyond the farm,  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:01):**  because you look in general, you look beyond things.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:04):**  So you found it is a good imbecile.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:07):**  Can you explain a bit what that is and what your beyond farming vision entails?  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:12):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:14):**  Basically, so the idea is because we are situated one hour east of Berlin, we  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:20):**  obviously have quite a good connectivity for people that, you know, who are  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:25):**  interested in those kinds of questions that we work on.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:28):**  And as I said, like, you know, I believe that the role of us as farmers is far  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:34):**  beyond what we today think of, you know, it's not only primary production, it is,  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:39):**  and it can be so many more fascinating things.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:42):**  So we have a, well, we framed a name, so to say, for that concept, which we call  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:47):**  beyond farming, which really consists of three different parts.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:50):**  It's as beyond sustainability, which is of course, you know, the whole idea of  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:54):**  saying, well, we don't want to just sustain, you know, we want to make it better.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:58):**  So we find, or we're looking for different forms of multifunction land use models  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:05):**  and bring them here on our challenging environment with a low precipitation and  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:10):**  the sandy soil, test them here, develop them here and see how they can be done  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:16):**  in a way that they are socially, ecologically and economically, let's say,  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:20):**  beneficial.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:21):**  So that is one part, bring in those different, you know, lines of thought, I  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:26):**  guess, from regenerative agriculture, just to show, you know, what is possible and  
**[0:03:30-0:03:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:30):**  what not.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:30):**  On a large scale, like a large commercial farm, I think that's often forgotten  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:36):**  because often this research is done and it's not just a commercial farm, it's  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:40):**  either in universities or other places that maybe don't have to focus on  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:43):**  profitability or need to have it because I mean, you have people to pay or you  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:47):**  have people to pay.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:48):**  So there's this interesting, the farm as a platform or the land as a platform, but  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:53):**  within certain boundaries and certain, I mean, within the normal, let's say  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:57):**  farming between brackets, normal farming system.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:01):**  I mean, that's a good point.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:02):**  I think, you know, in order to really be part of a paradigm that is being changed  
**[0:04:08-0:04:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:08):**  or to work into that, we can only make sure that it is applicable if we can  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:16):**  scale it and if it is economically feasible, right?  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:19):**  So you can think about ecological and social benefits all you want.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:24):**  You need to find obviously a way that you can as a farmer earn good income from  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:29):**  it and be sustainable from an economic point of view.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:32):**  So yeah, you're absolutely right.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:34):**  I mean, I think, you know, you have to bring it into the real context of being  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:39):**  included or like a big part of running the farm or being, you know, the farm  
**[0:04:45-0:04:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:45):**  business.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:46):**  So yeah, we will try to scale it up.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:49):**  At the same time, obviously there's, you know, so much knowledge to be captured,  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:54):**  so much, let's say learnings to be made that, you know, a way for us is also to  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:00):**  have people come in that either are skilled in that area already or that,  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:07):**  let's say, do a monitoring of it, be it NGOs, be it scientific groups, be it  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:14):**  universities, to make sure that you can actually capture all the experience and  
**[0:05:18-0:05:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:18):**  the learnings that you see.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:20):**  And I mean, there's just so many, right?  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:23):**  Sorry, I interrupted your beyond the three points of beyond.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:26):**  We are still beyond sustainability.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:28):**  Yeah, I was going to come back to that.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:29):**  But thank you for that.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:31):**  No, so that's really, you know, that's the whole beyond sustainability part.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:35):**  Then on another note, we always say beyond food, because I think to bring in,  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:41):**  let's say the public, to bring in also politicians, to bring in many people who  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:46):**  are often, you know, talking about agriculture, let's say without really  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:51):**  being aware of it in that instance, or who talk about food, but don't think about  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:55):**  agriculture, I think you, it's always important to find a good, like you have  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:02):**  to speak their language, right?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:03):**  And coming too much, let's say from the agriculture angle, I think many are not  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:08):**  yet there to understand that link between the two.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:11):**  So when we have guests, when we have visitors, when we are somewhere invited  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:16):**  to talk somewhere, then we always come from, let's say the food angle.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:20):**  And so, yeah, start the conversation on food and then move them into agriculture  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:25):**  and try to establish a feeling of why the two are so strongly interconnected,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:31):**  why soil health has to do with plant health, human health, animal health.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:36):**  And I think it's a good way of starting a conversation and making people  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:40):**  interested about, you know, agriculture as such, because it is so strongly linked  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:45):**  to emotions that you always have to find a way how they can open themselves up  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:50):**  for something that...  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:51):**  And start a discussion without polarizing it immediately.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:55):**  Exactly.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:56):**  Because you lose people very quickly, which, or farmers in general, I mean,  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:00):**  you lose people in general very quickly in these topics, especially on animal  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:05):**  agriculture, especially on GMOs, especially on the big chemical companies.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:10):**  I mean, they're very rightfully so very touchy subjects.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:13):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:15):**  But food is something we all do.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:16):**  So, yeah, it's a great way, a great segue into not starting to talk about soil  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:22):**  immediately, which we usually do.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:24):**  But maybe it's not the best way, it's maybe to start to talk about food and how  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:28):**  that came from soil and the importance and the challenges and the opportunities.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:33):**  Yeah, exactly that.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:34):**  And I think, you know, when we have visitors or friends even here, one of the  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:39):**  first things I always say is that I want them to be as honest and open as they  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:44):**  possibly can, because I tell them what I think and I tell them, you know, all my  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:48):**  thoughts and ideas and feelings and whatnot.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:51):**  And, you know, if you have people visiting and them not being open, not asking  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:57):**  questions, even if they think, you know, it might be a question that I don't want  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:00):**  to hear, you will never touch those points, those emotions that you actually  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:05):**  need to touch upon if you want to get into a real discussion and if you even  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:09):**  might want to change something either in yourself or in the one you're talking to.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:13):**  So, and I think food is something where, you know, you can find that level quite  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:19):**  easily and then move on to more complicated matters.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:24):**  So that's that part.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:26):**  And the third is basically what we call beyond business or beyond farm business,  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:31):**  really, because being, let's say, an actor in the rural area and obviously having,  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:37):**  let's say, the land that you're managing, the forest that you're managing, a lot of  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:41):**  infrastructure that goes with it, you know, it's also there.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:45):**  It's not only primary production.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:47):**  Like we always understand ourselves also as a platform.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:50):**  So we work together with different startups that we, you know, assign certain  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:54):**  fields from, or we use the technology or use their product.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:58):**  So we try to bring in some value for them.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:01):**  At the same time, basically we lease land to a couple that are starting a market  
**[0:09:07-0:09:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:07):**  garden now, and then the land that we're leasing is for us actually not too good to  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:14):**  cultivate, but for them it's everything, right?  
**[0:09:16-0:09:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:16):**  So there's huge potential in that.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:18):**  And also there's some synergies, but it goes beyond that.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:21):**  It goes through basically educating people, right?  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:24):**  I mean, you could invite schools, you can invite other kids to say, look, you know,  
**[0:09:30-0:09:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:30):**  just use the land for educating, use the land for all kinds of things.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:37):**  And it either goes beyond that and thinking about art, think about, yeah,  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:46):**  different alternative models of...  
**[0:09:48-0:09:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:48):**  Tell me about the gigantic root system that you had arrived on your farm as part of an art project.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:56):**  Yeah, I'll upload a photo of that.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:58):**  But basically, so we have this, basically the area where we live here and where we  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:02):**  farm is pretty much where the war ended.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:05):**  And so all the old oak trees, I mean, they have seen it all in a way.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:11):**  And next year in spring, we're celebrating the 75th anniversary of the ending of the war.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:18):**  For the internationalism, the Second World War we're talking about.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:21):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:23):**  And we met this artist who's always been involved in history, German history, and also working  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:29):**  with wood.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:30):**  And I said, man, what do you think about doing something together?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:33):**  I would love to do some sort of art project.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:35):**  And so we thought about that idea and went back and forth.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:39):**  And he said, don't you have an old root of an oak?  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:44):**  And I was like, yeah, of course, we have plenty of those.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:48):**  So we found this huge oak root, which is, I don't know, five, six metres wide.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:53):**  And the tree is estimated to be around 200 years old.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:57):**  So basically, we took it out of the earth and carried it on the estate.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:05):**  And now it's there to dry.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:06):**  And next year, we're hoping to be able to put it in front of the, or on the stairs of  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:11):**  the Reichstag in Berlin.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:14):**  And the art curatorium of the Bundestag will discuss it and think about it in January,  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:21):**  I think.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:22):**  Which is the parliament building of Berlin.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:24):**  That would be a nice symbol, getting the roots.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:29):**  I've seen it.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:30):**  We'll put a picture.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:31):**  It's absolutely massive.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:33):**  And as it should be, it's a 200 plus year old tree.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:36):**  But it's very impressive to see the full or a big part of the root system above ground  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:41):**  and not in the soil.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:42):**  Yeah, I mean, it's incredible.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:44):**  And I think also, the root is something that many people often don't think about.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:50):**  And if you see that structure, I mean, it's just fascinating.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:54):**  It's really changing your look on things.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:56):**  And I think that is really something that we have to do on such a great scale.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:00):**  And that is, I think, why art takes or has to have such a huge part of that whole discussion  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:05):**  we have today about changing the way we think about ecosystems, changing the way we think  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:10):**  about certain, let's say, economic processes, the set up of companies.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:15):**  I mean, that is all somehow involved with the horizon, at least of the...  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:21):**  I think in terms of art and education, there's an enormous role to make things visible, like  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:26):**  the root system, to make region X visible, to make the damages of the current ecosystem  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:31):**  visible, to make the potential and the imagination.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:34):**  I think there's a huge role for that.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:38):**  And something with the aesthetics of things and the taste of things, I think are very  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:42):**  closely connected and make all of these discussions just a lot easier and a lot more fascinating,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:49):**  honestly.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:50):**  I want to shift gears to, we're going to be extremely practical.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:54):**  We're going to unpack a bit the farm.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:58):**  And we already mentioned a few things, but I want to start with a question actually.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:01):**  Why are you spending your time on a Friday afternoon to start on what could be quite  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:06):**  an extensive journey to explore transition finance, not only for your farm, but actually  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:12):**  the principles of transition finance for many other farmers, let's say in Europe, but also  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:17):**  actually outside Europe.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:19):**  What made you choose to take on next to all the farming, the root systems we discussed  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:24):**  before to take on another project?  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:27):**  That's a good question and one that I've heard before, I guess.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:32):**  But when it comes to this podcast and the whole question of transitioning finance, I  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:36):**  think there's so many young people, there's so many progressive thinkers, there's so many  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:42):**  progressive farmers that are realising the situation that they're in.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:47):**  Obviously there's some that are fighting to somehow stay alive, not only the farm, but  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:54):**  the families, the work, the passion that they have, the love that they have for farming.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:59):**  And I think those are confronted with incredible problems and incredible, let's say, tasks  
**[0:14:05-0:14:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:05):**  ahead.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:06):**  So there's that whole group of people who are pretty much forced to find a new way.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:11):**  I mean, they are running out of options and I think for them transition financing in a  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:17):**  way that still gives them enough flexibility, that gives them enough freedom, that gives  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:21):**  them the chance, also, let's say from a psychological point, really, time to adapt, time to think  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:28):**  about new ways, time to widen the horizon.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:31):**  I think that is a huge area for people who are passionate about agriculture.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:38):**  And they really need it.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:39):**  So that's one part.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:40):**  And I think another part is of people saying and realising, wow, there is this whole new  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:46):**  paradigm of agriculture, a new paradigm of coping with agricultural land, of cultivating  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:53):**  land.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:54):**  There's a whole new meaningfulness of doing agriculture.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:57):**  And I want to get involved.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:59):**  I have me and my friends, I don't know, want to get involved.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:02):**  How do we do that?  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:03):**  How can we get into that?  
**[0:15:04-0:15:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:04):**  How can we start?  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:05):**  How can we, you know, get going?  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:08):**  So for those people and those potential also new farmers, I think they are exactly at that  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:14):**  point where they say, well, how can I actually start?  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:18):**  Because not having the land, not being in that industry already, it's close to impossible  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:23):**  to get going.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:24):**  And then there's a third group, which I guess I kind of consider myself part of, that is,  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:30):**  you know, already farming, maybe also faced with a couple of potential difficulties, but  
**[0:15:37-0:15:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:37):**  also incredibly interested to develop further, to go new ways and at the same time seeing  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:44):**  the incredible potential of it.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:46):**  But at the same time having a certain responsibility towards employees, towards family, towards  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:54):**  maybe oneself, but also obviously towards the land.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:57):**  And I think that group is also saying, well, you know, we've read all the books.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:02):**  We know, let's say the characteristics, we see the potential, we want to do it.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:07):**  We believe we can, you know, hit a market.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:10):**  Yeah, we've done the pilots.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:11):**  We're ready to go.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:13):**  But you know, obviously there's incredible risks involved.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:16):**  So I guess there's three different kinds of groups.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:19):**  There's probably many more, but like for me, there's like the large groups, which are all  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:24):**  capable and willing to move into that.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:29):**  And just because, yeah, there's so many people considering it, but all of which have to kind  
**[0:16:36-0:16:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:36):**  of go in unused waters.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:39):**  How do you say it?  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:40):**  Untapped waters.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:41):**  And unknown waters.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:43):**  But still, I mean, it comes back to, it still doesn't mean you have to do this.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:47):**  I want to definitely thank you for your time and that we're going to explore.

**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:46):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question,  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:50):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:54):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:54):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:56):**  Meaning, I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:00):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:05):**  different means.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:06):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:11):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:14):**  Thank you.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:15):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:16):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:23):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:25):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:30):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:35):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:40):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:41):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:46):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:50):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:55):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:56):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:58):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:00):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:04):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:06):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:11):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

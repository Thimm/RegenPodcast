**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:13):**  This episode is about landscape approach and why operating at a landscape scale is crucial  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:18):**  when regenerating soils, forests and seas and actually makes raising capital easier.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:24):**  If you are an investor and you're considering making investments in land use, you need to  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:28):**  look at the full landscape you're going to operate in.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:32):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:36):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:38):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:42):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:48):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:52):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:54):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:58):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:01):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:06):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:10):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:14):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:18):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:22):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:26):**  depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:31):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:36):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:40):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:01:48-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:48):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:50):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:52):**  Welcome to a new episode.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:53):**  I'm Koen Verseijen, your host.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:55):**  And today I interview Paul Chatterton, founder of the Landscape Finance Lab, an experimental  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:00):**  unit inside the World Wildlife Fund.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:02):**  They incubate sustainable landscapes and structure, launch and fund deals at landscape scale.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:07):**  I have a lot of questions because I think landscape scale is one of the most interesting  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:10):**  pieces of regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:13):**  So welcome, Paul.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:14):**  Thanks very much, Koen.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:15):**  It's a pleasure.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:17):**  Let's dive straight in with a personal question.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:20):**  What brings you to WWF?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:22):**  What brings you to Landscape Finance Lab?  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:24):**  What brings you to, let's say, land use and landscape scale?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:28):**  Because there are not too many people actually looking at that.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:31):**  It actually started sitting up a eucalypt tree in Tasmania in front of the bulldozers  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:37):**  many, many years ago.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:39):**  I used to work for the...  
**[0:02:40-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:40):**  Okay, I didn't know that.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:41):**  I couldn't have imagined a better start of the podcast.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:43):**  Go on, go on.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:44):**  Oh man, this tree was in a forest of the tallest flowering plants on the planet, the eucalyptus  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:51):**  regnans, the mountain ash, grow to 90 metres.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:55):**  My tree was 80 metres tall.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:57):**  I was sitting in the first branch, which was 30 metres above the ground.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:01):**  I sat there for a week to try to stop the bulldozers.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:06):**  We saved the forest.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:07):**  They cut that tree down immediately.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:09):**  They got us out of the sky.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:13):**  What it taught me was that although we won that battle, we lost the war because for the  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:22):**  next 15 years, we were fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:27):**  The conservationists versus the foresters, the politicians were playing us off against  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:33):**  each other.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:35):**  It made me realise that we needed to change the game and think in a bigger picture, think  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:40):**  in a more embracing way and find solutions that work for all of the people in the landscape  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:47):**  and for nature as well.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:48):**  That was a long journey that took me then to New Guinea where I ran WWF's conservation  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:54):**  programme and then to Austria and where I'm based now.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:59):**  And just to, for whoever doesn't know the landscape finance lab yet, what is it?  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:07):**  What was the idea behind it?  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:08):**  You're relatively new, you're an experimental unit that shows you're a pilot, but what was  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:12):**  the reason to found it and why a finance lab?  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:16):**  Yeah, the landscape finance lab was set up three years ago.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:21):**  In WWF, we've been successful at winning many battles, but that war is absolutely being  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:28):**  lost.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:29):**  There are half as many animals on this planet now in the wild as there were when I was born  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:36):**  50 years ago.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:37):**  It's a disaster.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:39):**  The tools we have at the moment are not up to the challenge.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:43):**  We need to change the whole way that we're working if we're going to save nature and  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:50):**  we need to shift whole economies to being green and supporting sustainability.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:57):**  The lab was developed out of some of the lessons we'd learnt with some of the big climate programmes  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:03):**  that we were developing to save rainforests.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:06):**  So, we were dealing with some very large finance.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:10):**  These were the largest projects that WWF had ever run in one place.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:15):**  We were able to secure $170 million for an area in the Democratic Republic of Congo just  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:24):**  north of Kinshasa to save an area of forest the size of Greece.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:29):**  What that taught us was that you can work with multiple players in a landscape.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:34):**  You can work with very big finance and as you work together, it became clear that you  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:40):**  create synergies between the different players, between the foresters that we'd been fighting  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:46):**  and ourselves, between the agriculturalists and the foresters and so forth.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:50):**  So, very much going back to that realisation in Tasmania.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:55):**  What we didn't realise at the time was the power of private sector finance to shift economies  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:02):**  towards sustainability and that was very much a focus of the lab.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:07):**  How do we do programmes to save nature and promote green economy at the scale of a million  
**[0:06:13-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:13):**  hectares, $100 million investment, dealing with a million tonnes of traded goods, a million  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:21):**  people.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:22):**  We've got to be able to operate at that scale as a nature conservation organisation if we're  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:27):**  going to save nature.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:28):**  But the planet needs that as well if we're going to reach the SDGs, the global goals.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:34):**  There's a lot to unpack there.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:36):**  But to look at Congo in a sense and to look at this monumental shift or paradigm shift  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:42):**  that happened in your team and the team with WWF, because I think this was one of the first  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:47):**  times you were actually not fighting the battle.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:49):**  You were actually getting most or maybe even all stakeholders involved and figuring out  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:54):**  a way, a puzzle basically to make everyone better instead of just blocking and basically  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:01):**  going against the foresters that you mentioned before that you kept losing.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:05):**  How did you get everyone involved and is that something of a landscape that if you think  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:09):**  at that scale you can actually figure out a way that it's a win-win for everyone?  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:14):**  That's actually the real beauty of the landscape approach.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:19):**  When you're looking, when you're dealing with small issues, a logging operation or a farm  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:26):**  and sustainability issues, then over a short timeframe of a small space you end up with  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:33):**  conflict.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:34):**  You've got very little room to move between the players.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:37):**  With a landscape program you can all take a breath because you can think about landscape.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:42):**  You have to think about landscapes over at least a 10-year period, ideally a generation  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:47):**  or more.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:48):**  You've got to think about them over a much larger space which then gives you all the  
**[0:07:53-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:53):**  ability to be more creative, to move operations over time rather than immediately, to restore  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:01):**  forests or water flows or whatever.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:04):**  This is absolutely the power of the landscape approach that it gives everyone space to think  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:09):**  and dream and find their own place over time.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:13):**  You don't have to do it all at once.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:15):**  Do you have an example of that in this case because I'm struggling to see how a forester  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:21):**  that just to put a, make it a character basically wants to cut down as fast as possible and  
**[0:08:28-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:28):**  sell.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:29):**  How do you get a company like that on board on a regeneration, not even sustainability,  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:34):**  but actually how did you get them on a regenerative way of thinking?  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:40):**  How do you do that and how does a landscape approach make that possible?  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:44):**  Well, let's go back to the Democratic Republic of Congo.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:47):**  The province of Maha Ndombe is north of Kinshasa.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:52):**  There's about 10 logging concessions in that area that cover an area of about a million  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:58):**  hectares.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:59):**  These are the forests where you find the bonobo chimp, the closest animal to human beings.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:06):**  We as an organization have been fighting with those logging operations for a long time.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:11):**  They've been very destructively managed.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:14):**  They haven't had much money to do things properly.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:17):**  What happened when we started working on the landscape approach was that we were able to  
**[0:09:22-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:22):**  offer with the World Bank carbon funds for changing behavior in forest management.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:30):**  As soon as the companies realized that that was available, they started talking to us.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:35):**  The more we talked, they admitted that their concessions weren't profitable at the moment.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:41):**  They were hanging onto them in the hope that timber prices might go up.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:45):**  But they were very happy to shift their business model, some of them to sell out completely,  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:50):**  others to shift over to more sustainable operations knowing that there'd be a new income stream  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:55):**  that would help them to make that shift.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:10:00):**  Rather than fighting on a concession by concession basis with each other, we were all looking  
**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:10:05):**  at a much bigger picture.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:10:07):**  Again, it created opportunities for those companies to also be helping in planting plantations  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:10:15):**  away from the native forest that could supply the needs of Kinshasa, working with communities  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:10:20):**  to allow forests to regenerate and taking some of that for charcoal production in a  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:10:26):**  sustainable way instead of cutting down the old-growth rainforests.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:10:33):**  It's really changing the game.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:10:35):**  It's early days still, but already we're seeing the forest coming back, the water flows improving,  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:10:42):**  women have to walk less distance in the trial villages at least.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:10:47):**  And we hope to expand that to a thousand villages.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:10:50):**  And is that something that gives you hope in a sense?  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:10:53):**  Because I see that in soil often, I think the standard approach was, or the standard  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:10:58):**  way of thinking, it takes 10,000 years to build an inch of topsoil.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:02):**  And it takes a long time, and now we're actually seeing that some farmers do it way, way faster.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:07):**  Is that something you see in forestry, et cetera, as well?  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:10):**  It does bounce back if you give it space and structure and you maybe even help or you maybe  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:16):**  replant certain things.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:17):**  Do we have a chance?  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:18):**  Does it come back fast enough?  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:20):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:21):**  If you've got core rainforest seed bank, you can grow rainforest back.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:27):**  Not all of it, not everywhere, but in many places, certainly.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:31):**  And what's really exciting is that animals come back really rapidly as well.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:35):**  If you take the pressure off, my friends in Gabon had turned a very large area, which  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:42):**  had no elephants, into a place that was full of elephants in 10 years.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:47):**  Is that a place where they're surfing the elephants?  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:49):**  Sorry?  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:50):**  I once say, I don't know if I'm just making it up, an article of surfing elephants, of  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:54):**  surfing hippos maybe in Gabon, I think.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:11:57):**  This does include a beach area, so it could well be.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:01):**  Maybe they were hippos.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:02):**  I will find it and put it in the show notes below.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:04):**  I think it was a Time article a long time ago.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:06):**  Yeah, my friend was actually telling me about the elephants that appeared on his house,  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:11):**  which is right on the beach, so it could be the same one.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:15):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:16):**  And so taking this experience of the Democratic Republic of Congo, you founded this lab, which  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:23):**  by the name is an experimental area, and you started working with other landscapes.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:27):**  How did that process go?  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:29):**  How do you choose them, because you're a small team based in Vienna, and there's only so  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:33):**  much you can do, obviously.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:34):**  So what's the process now, after a few years of trying and trials to work with other landscapes  
**[0:12:40-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:40):**  than Congo?  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:42):**  So the important principle is that the landscapes have to build themselves.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:46):**  The people in the landscapes have to already be very organized and ready to go on to the  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:52):**  next stage.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:53):**  So we have an online platform.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:12:56):**  People fill out details, just some basic details about where they're up to.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:13:00):**  They need to show that they've got the scale.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:13:04):**  And people in this case are local NGOs.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:13:08):**  What kind of groups do you see approaching you?  
**[0:13:10-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:13:10):**  So we started with WWF offices in places like Fiji, Cambodia, Cameroon, and so forth.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:13:18):**  And now we're getting provincial governments.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:13:22):**  The government of Yucatan has applied, investment companies, national governments, companies  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:13:30):**  are starting to put ideas forward.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:13:36):**  Anyone can kick off a landscape program.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:13:39):**  The fundamental principle, though, is that they then have to form a multi-stakeholder  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:13:43):**  partnership.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:13:44):**  A group of people who want to solve a problem in that landscape, they go through a process  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:13:49):**  of understanding the landscape better and the problem and each other.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:13:55):**  And then they develop a collaborative plan to address the problem.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:13:58):**  It's quite simple.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:14:00):**  And then we help them with that and with getting the financing for the individual activities  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:14:06):**  to address the problem.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:14:08):**  And that might be grant financing, it might be carbon financing, or more recently, we're  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:14:15):**  starting to show the ability to bring in private financing into areas.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:14:20):**  And continue on that thought, do you have an example of private finance or one of the  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:14:25):**  landscapes that's most mostly advanced in this process of where the smart impact investors  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:14:31):**  that are listening to this show could get an idea of what's possible?  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:14:35):**  Yeah, well, I've just come off a call.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:14:37):**  We're right in the middle of developing an investment fund in Fiji for businesses that  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:14:43):**  can help contribute to saving Fiji's reef system.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:14:48):**  Fiji has this fabulous reef system that actually contributes half of the economy from fishing  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:14:54):**  and tourism.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:14:56):**  And that's going to disappear under climate change because of all of the stresses, the  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:02):**  pollution that comes down off the land.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:05):**  So we want to work with...  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:07):**  Just to summarize, basically, Fiji is killing his own reef, not only because of we're all  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:12):**  polluting way too much and the temperature in the ocean and acidity is going up, but  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:16):**  also because of the runoffs of their farms on the islands, right?  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:20):**  Exactly, from the farms.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:21):**  So there's a direct connection.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:22):**  It's not only, I mean, it's obviously also our fault, but part of the issue is the local  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:28):**  pressure of the runoffs of farms that actually basically bleaches the reefs.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:33):**  Exactly.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:34):**  All the nutrients, the pesticides and fertilizers poison the reefs, the silt from the housing  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:41):**  developments, the poo from the tourists.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:43):**  The tourists come destroying what they come to see, in fact.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:47):**  So how do we shift that around?  
**[0:15:49-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:49):**  We helped 15 organizations of four government departments, a number of NGOs, industry groups,  
**[0:15:57-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:15:57):**  banks to put together a $115 million call for saving the reefs of Fiji.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:16:04):**  And that involved shifting over to organic agriculture, shifting to sustainable fisheries  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:16:12):**  and restoring the mangrove forest and the river forests and dealing with waste management.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:16:18):**  And we're now developing a $30 million public sector funding program with the Fijian government.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:16:26):**  The workshops were just happening last week, in fact.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:16:29):**  But parallel to that, there's a whole lot of businesses that can actually benefit very  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:16:34):**  nicely from this sort of transition.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:16:36):**  Organic agriculture is already getting a good impact investment and we want to scale that  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:16:41):**  up.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:16:42):**  Carbon money for the forest restoration and impact investment for the fishery.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:16:47):**  We're setting up a company, well, it's a local entrepreneur who's leading it at the moment.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:16:52):**  The company is called Matanotaki, which is the Fijian word for action, the next step  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:16:59):**  on from Tolanoa.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:17:01):**  And that'll manage investments from around the world into projects that contribute to  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:17:06):**  the goals of saving the reef and also monitor the impacts.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:17:10):**  We've got a couple of projects already that are lined up.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:17:13):**  We're talking to an investor in London just yesterday who's ready to move on this and  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:17:20):**  we'll be looking for other investors to join in.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:17:23):**  It's extremely interesting, first of all, but also the first time I hear organic and  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:17:27):**  I hope this will be the regenerative organic type and not the plowing version of organic  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:17:32):**  because we've seen that way too often, unfortunately.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:17:35):**  But the first time I hear organic and regenerative agriculture connecting to the reef.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:17:39):**  But because that connection is so clear and so direct, I think the case in this case for  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:17:44):**  transition finance to help as many farms and farmers to actually switch, to make that transition  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:17:50):**  and to start supplying hopefully to the local tourists.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:17:53):**  So to actually get that circle and to the local hotels, et cetera.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:17:56):**  I mean, it's crazy that Fiji has to import a lot of its food, especially serving the  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:00):**  tourists and then actually destroying the reef in the process.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:03):**  It's insane.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:04):**  And again, this is the beauty of the landscape approach.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:07):**  You wouldn't think that farmers would be the solution to saving the reefs, but that's how  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:12):**  it came out when everyone sat down.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:15):**  I always think that farmers are the solution to any problem.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:18):**  So then farmers are the solution for everything, of course.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:20):**  So are the farmers.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:21):**  I mean, but yeah, no, no, I get your point.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:24):**  And so that's, I mean, it's a small island, a small island system, sorry, but it's a huge  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:28):**  amount of, still there, 115 and a 30 million fund.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:33):**  This gives you a certain understanding of the scale you're thinking and working and  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:37):**  operating that we need, that we absolutely need, but that I often miss in much smaller  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:42):**  programs, a few hectares here, a few hundred hectares, et cetera, which really is just  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:47):**  not going to get us to scale in time because we're literally running out of time and running  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:52):**  out of topsoil.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:53):**  What do you see, I mean, you have been a few years in the program now, you've been, what  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:18:58):**  has, if we look one year ago, it's now May, 2019.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:19:02):**  If we look one or one and a half year ago till now, what do you see as the biggest shift  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:19:06):**  that has happened in the full sector that you're operating in?  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:19:10):**  Well, for us, it's been understanding how businesses work and what bankers need to invest  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:19:16):**  in good businesses.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:19:19):**  The last year has been a really dramatic learning curve for us, listening to bankers, shadowing  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:19:25):**  them, understanding what they would invest in and wouldn't, and then working with the  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:19:31):**  businesses to see from their side whether that sort of thing makes sense and whether  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:19:35):**  they can deliver impact.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:19:37):**  Do you have an example of that, like something that already came out?  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:19:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:19:41):**  I mean, in Cambodia, we're working with H&M, the world's second largest government company  
**[0:19:47-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:19:47):**  who, it turns out that the garment company in Cambodia is a major driver of forest destruction.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:19:56):**  They use wood to fuel the boilers that produce the steam for pressing the clothes and dying  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:20:04):**  the cloth and so forth.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:20:06):**  Another example of something you would never have seen if you didn't look at a landscape  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:20:10):**  size.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:20:11):**  No, exactly.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:20:12):**  Most of this happens in Phnom Penh, but the impact is out in places like the Eastern Plains,  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:20:19):**  which is the largest rainforest left in China.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:20:22):**  We're connecting these two and thinking about how do you actually shift the factories over  
**[0:20:29-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:20:29):**  to purchasing wood from known plantations, not from the forest, and then eventually shift  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:20:38):**  out of wood to solar.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:20:41):**  That's not possible at the moment, so wood is the main option.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:20:46):**  Agricultural waste briquettes are being experimented with as well.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:20:50):**  This came down to a very practical set of questions.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:20:55):**  How does the factory – can the factory get wood at a price basically the same as what  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:21:01):**  they're paying now, but legal and sustainable?  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:21:05):**  And then who's going to supply that?  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:21:08):**  There are a couple of plantation companies we're talking with whose operations are  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:21:13):**  reasonably good.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:21:14):**  We want to be sure that they are absolutely above board environmentally and that they're  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:21:22):**  progressing towards certification.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:21:24):**  They're not there yet, but there's not much in Cambodia that is.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:21:28):**  But if we look at it over a 10-year period and if we've got the whole garment industry  
**[0:21:33-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:21:33):**  in Cambodia coming online to commit to shifting their sourcing, then you can really give some  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:21:40):**  great opportunities to some of these plantation businesses.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:21:44):**  That gives opportunities to bankers to be able to help them with the money to expand  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:21:49):**  their operations and really make the change rapidly.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:21:54):**  So we're really seeing now that the finance is a tremendous driver and also the purchasing,  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:22:01):**  the global purchasing systems, the big companies who are driving those economies can be a real  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:22:08):**  help if they're committed to sustainability as well.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:22:12):**  Is there something else that you've seen change over the last, let's say, last year,  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:22:18):**  last years that these large companies are getting involved in the landscapes, not just  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:22:23):**  in their supply webs or supply chains that they have been doing, especially the forward-looking  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:22:27):**  ones, but actually getting to a landscape thinking?  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:22:32):**  Is it something you've seen happening or you would like it more, but is that a shift  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:22:37):**  from let's say five years ago when you started looking at landscapes more and more?  
**[0:22:42-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:22:42):**  I think a lot of them have very strong goals for sustainability and I know that their consumers  
**[0:22:49-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:22:49):**  want rainforest-free and cruelty-free and so forth products.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:22:55):**  The big challenge for a big company is how do you actually make that work and it's  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:22:59):**  got to work at some scale for it to be interesting for them.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:23:03):**  They're not small pet projects are not going to do it.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:23:07):**  With the cocoa industry, we're working with them in West Africa in Cameroon and they've  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:23:13):**  got a challenge that in the next 10 years, the cocoa production will drop 40% because  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:23:19):**  of climate change.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:23:20):**  The forests and the agricultural areas are drying up.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:23:25):**  So they've got to find solutions and it's got to be at a large enough scale to deal  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:23:32):**  with the microclimates in those areas of West Africa and that's about saving.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:23:37):**  What do you mean by that?  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:23:38):**  Like you need to be large enough to influence the local microclimates.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:23:42):**  So the water flow is very much dictated by forest cover.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:23:48):**  If you have forest, you have water.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:23:51):**  If you lose your forest, the water disappears in West Africa.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:23:56):**  But this suggests that it could come back if you plant the forest, replant the forest.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:00):**  It can.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:01):**  That's the theory.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:02):**  We've got to test it.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:03):**  But West Africa, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Cameroon produce 60% of the world's cocoa beans.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:09):**  They're drying up rapidly and their ability to produce is really diminishing.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:15):**  Ivory Coast and Ghana don't have much forest left.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:17):**  They've chopped it down.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:18):**  So they're in a difficult position.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:20):**  Ghana still has very large areas of forest and the cocoa industry wants to make sure  
**[0:24:25-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:25):**  that it's deforestation-free.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:26):**  It doesn't want to be blamed for chopping down rainforests.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:31):**  But more importantly, their business model depends on being able to secure that water  
**[0:24:35-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:35):**  flow and that's about being part of a much bigger initiative to protect the Congo jungles  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:42):**  in that area.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:43):**  We'll just kick that off.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:45):**  But we're looking at securing quite large areas of forest and helping the cocoa industry  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:51):**  to be agents of reforestation with the farmers that they purchase from.  
**[0:24:57-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:57):**  That's a long-term initiative.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:24:59):**  It'll take a lot of research.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:01):**  But already we're confident that we've got the commitment from the industry to move that  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:06):**  forward.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:08):**  And because I'm making an assumption here that most of the private investors or most  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:13):**  of the private wealth actually is in, let's say Europe, North America.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:18):**  Is it difficult because most of the projects you mentioned are very far away?  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:22):**  So two questions.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:23):**  One, are you working on projects closer to these investors?  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:26):**  And if not, or actually also yes, how do you get investors from far, literally culturally  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:32):**  distance, et cetera, how do you get them involved or has it been difficult or tricky to get  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:37):**  interest from the private investor wealth that maybe are not the World Bank, et cetera?  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:43):**  So we're just starting.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:45):**  We're learning day by day.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:47):**  It's really, really quite exciting.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:49):**  But I think one of the key lessons we learned is that our best friends are the local banks  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:25:56):**  and local financial institutions, the Fiji Development Bank, the Fiji Reserve Bank, ANZ  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:02):**  Bank in Fiji.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:03):**  They have been very, very useful and supportive players.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:08):**  We didn't realize how excited they'd get by this and how valuable it would be for them  
**[0:26:13-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:13):**  as well.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:14):**  In Cambodia, it's a clean bank, the largest bank and probably the greenest bank in Cambodia  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:20):**  that's become interested in being a partner in this process.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:25):**  And that makes it much easier for investors on the other side of the world to know that  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:30):**  there's some local institutions that can provide some rigor to the investments and some checks  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:35):**  and balances and some boots on the ground and some understanding of local culture and  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:40):**  ways of doing business.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:41):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:42):**  And you know, in the long run, these things have to be sustainable, have to be managed  
**[0:26:48-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:48):**  locally even right from the first day.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:51):**  That's our principle is landscapes first.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:53):**  The team on the ground leads it.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:26:56):**  We provide some support and coaching, but they make the decisions and our goal is to  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:27:02):**  help them to get the resources to build this slowly and steadily until they've got $100  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:27:08):**  million between them to really shift the needle to change what's happening in their landscapes.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:27:14):**  And I think that's a big shift because most of the world is run from New York and Geneva  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:27:21):**  and Frankfurt.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:27:23):**  The money goes out.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:27:25):**  It's brought out by people from those countries who do work with locals and then the profit  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:27:31):**  and control goes back.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:27:33):**  If we can put the finance and the control in the hands of the people in the landscape,  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:27:39):**  they've got an incentive to look after their own home much more than the people on the  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:27:45):**  other side of the world do.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:27:47):**  And how that plays out, I'm not clear.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:27:49):**  We're just at the early days of building this, but I think it is possible to have significant  
**[0:27:57-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:27:57):**  financing at scale in landscapes like Fiji or Cameroon that's run fully by local organisations.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:28:06):**  And run fully probably also means part of it has to be raised locally.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:28:10):**  I mean, a local bank obviously, it's mostly local savers, et cetera.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:28:15):**  At some point, if you want to get to $100 million, maybe the local bank isn't enough,  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:28:21):**  but I completely agree.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:28:23):**  I think it has to be a hybrid between definitely some, if necessary, only if, as some money  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:28:28):**  from outside to get there faster.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:28:31):**  But the more you can find locally, the more sense it makes.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:28:35):**  And also the more democratisation of impact investing happens because otherwise it's always  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:28:40):**  going to be a few families or a few institutions in the cities you just mentioned, which at  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:28:45):**  the end of the day will be fine anyway.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:28:48):**  If we cut down the whole rainforest in Cambodia, they won't notice, but local people will.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:28:53):**  So it's that, how do you bridge that gap between where the money is and where the money  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:28:58):**  is necessary without getting into the same power struggles we've been for a long time?  
**[0:29:03-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:03):**  Exactly.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:04):**  And that'll be a big test.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:05):**  In Fiji, for instance, the government has a pretty limited budget and there's a lot  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:10):**  of aid money flowing.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:12):**  They don't tend to put their money into aid projects because they last a few years,  
**[0:29:17-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:17):**  they disappear and then another aid project comes.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:20):**  It might help, it may not.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:22):**  But if they can see that there's something that they'll be owning over time, I think  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:27):**  there's more chance that they'll put their own money in.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:30):**  That's going to be a big test of our work in Fiji.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:33):**  And I think we'll determine the scale that we can get to.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:37):**  But let's see.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:39):**  But also I think on the structure side as well, because if it's locally structured  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:43):**  on local conditions and you are able to get in outside investors, at least they don't  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:47):**  have the advantage of dictating the deal or dictating the structures or dictating the  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:53):**  fund.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:54):**  The money only comes if we do this, this and this.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:29:57):**  Now the structure and the conditions have been set locally.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:01):**  And if you want to invest, great.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:02):**  If you don't, we'll find it somewhere else.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:04):**  This is of course an ideal scenario.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:06):**  And I'm not saying that this ever happens, but it does shift the game.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:10):**  Like, look, you're investing in something locally and you like it or not.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:15):**  There's no, it's not that you can come in and set these deals or these conditions in  
**[0:30:20-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:20):**  Fiji.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:21):**  And I think the Fijians don't want to control everything.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:24):**  They want to be partners with their investors, but they want the flexibility to do things  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:30):**  in a Fijian way that's going to build over time and be stable.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:33):**  And that's what any good investor would want as well, I would think.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:36):**  Yeah, no, I completely agree because there's only so much you can do from a long distance.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:42):**  It's also, it's a huge risk mitigation, obviously, if you're, if there's a very strong landscape  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:48):**  partnership with very strong local partners, I think as an investor, you should be very  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:52):**  wary if you're investing somewhere long-term in something land use related.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:30:56):**  And if there's not a landscape approach, I think there should be a few red flags going  
**[0:31:00-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:00):**  up in your, in your diligence.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:02):**  Well the advantage of a landscape approach we're finding is that it gives you all of  
**[0:31:07-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:07):**  the stakeholders you'd want to talk to.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:09):**  If you're a business, you don't have to do that work yourself.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:13):**  It gives you a set of very clear and simple SDG targets that you can work towards and  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:19):**  monitoring systems to measure those.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:21):**  So you don't have to do that yourself.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:23):**  It helps with the regulatory questions that you have as a business in doing fish farming  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:29):**  or growing ginger and turmeric or whatever it might be that you're growing.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:34):**  And it gives you a bigger goal that you can contribute to, which makes your life more  
**[0:31:40-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:40):**  exciting as well.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:42):**  What we're finding with Fiji too is that the landscape, by taking the landscape approach,  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:47):**  we can bring in multiple, quite different streams of finance.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:50):**  You know, there's this $30 million public financing from the Green Climate Fund that  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:55):**  we're hoping to bring.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:31:57):**  There'll be, there's an impact investor linked to a major bank that's talking about bringing  
**[0:32:07-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:32:07):**  an amount of money in.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:32:08):**  There's another family office that'll bring another set of money that can be used for  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:32:13):**  different types of activities.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:32:16):**  We can do crowdfunding for the early incubation process for startups.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:32:21):**  And we've actually got an insurance company very interested in looking at a different  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:32:25):**  type of insurance product that rewards climate friendly businesses and so forth.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:32:31):**  So we're actually able to bring in quite a few different types of finance.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:32:36):**  And some of them may not happen, but some will.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:32:40):**  But that again creates synergies and makes the whole system more stable is my theory.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:32:45):**  This is all theory, of course.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:32:46):**  You know, we've not achieved any of this in practice.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:32:49):**  So I'm talking through my hat really.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:32:52):**  But the progress is quite exciting at the moment.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:32:55):**  And just to get off that cloud of theory, what are the biggest barriers you see to make  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:33:01):**  the landscape approach and the regeneration of landscapes?  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:33:04):**  Because I think we really have to move beyond sustainability because it keeps it as it is,  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:33:08):**  which isn't good enough.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:33:09):**  What are the biggest barriers you see to make it to make this more economically viable for  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:33:14):**  more investors to see this as a crucial piece in their, let's say investment strategy?  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:33:20):**  Well, I think just understanding the landscape approach.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:33:24):**  We wrote a book a few years ago, the Little Sustainable Landscape Book, to bring a whole  
**[0:33:30-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:33:30):**  lot of organizations together under one single explanation of the landscape approach.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:33:37):**  But we need to get that message out again and again, make it really simple.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:33:41):**  There's five basic steps to build a landscape program, make sure that people understand  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:33:46):**  that and that investors understand that.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:33:49):**  The other block, I guess, is that is this.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:33:51):**  What are the five steps?  
**[0:33:52-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:33:52):**  So the five steps are a multi-stakeholder platform, common understanding of the issues  
**[0:34:00-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:00):**  in the landscape and possible solutions, an agreed action plan to address those solutions,  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:08):**  getting on and implementing it, and then monitoring and learning.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:11):**  Yeah, I can see investors saying, yeah, that's very complicated.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:15):**  It takes a lot of time.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:17):**  But I think that's why it's interesting that you can basically, I wouldn't say piggyback,  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:21):**  but partner with groups like yourself where it's already happening in the landscape and  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:26):**  you don't have to do it completely from scratch as an investor, because that's also not really  
**[0:34:30-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:30):**  your role.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:32):**  Partly it is, obviously, but partly it isn't.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:34):**  So you need partners in this.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:35):**  But I can see many say, yeah, that's too complicated.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:38):**  It takes too long.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:39):**  I'll just make a direct investment somewhere and won't bother too much with it.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:43):**  No, exactly.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:44):**  And I think that's the challenge, is to make this standard practice so that investors don't  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:50):**  have to think about it.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:53):**  Landscape programs give them the framework to be clear on what they should be investing  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:34:57):**  in and whether their investments are really making an impact.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:02):**  And those impacts can then be rolled up into the national reporting and global reporting  
**[0:35:07-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:07):**  on the global goals.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:09):**  So building that landscape program approach is part of our challenge.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:15):**  But then getting investment into the individual activities is the next one and working out  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:21):**  simple ways to do that so that investors don't have to do all of the hard work of understanding  
**[0:35:27-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:27):**  a landscape program.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:28):**  It just becomes yes or no.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:30):**  Do I want to be in a landscape program or don't I?  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:33):**  And here's the benefits and here's the costs and here is not.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:38):**  We're starting to get that story clear, but there's still a bit of work to do.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:43):**  And just to take a landscape overview for a second to go to a slightly higher level.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:49):**  I've seen an interview somewhere with you where you mentioned there are a thousand landscapes  
**[0:35:52-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:52):**  of which a hundred are critical.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:54):**  Is that number still up to date?  
**[0:35:56-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:56):**  Because a thousand seems a lot and very little at the same time and a hundred seems very  
**[0:35:59-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:35:59):**  manageable.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:00):**  But I don't know if I'm completely underestimating this challenge.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:04):**  One day when I've got time, I'll write a scientific paper on this, but the back of the envelope,  
**[0:36:11-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:11):**  look at it, says that there are about a thousand landscapes, sorry, ecoregions on the planet,  
**[0:36:18-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:18):**  type ecological type.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:20):**  So to be precise, I think there's 780 odd and there's about a thousand river basins.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:27):**  There's about a, if you count it up, there's about a thousand small countries and provinces  
**[0:36:33-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:33):**  and large countries.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:35):**  So whichever way you cut it, there's about a thousand landscapes on the planet.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:39):**  But when you look at the SDGs, the global goals, if you want to address carbon emissions,  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:45):**  they come from about a hundred landscapes.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:47):**  In terms of forest emissions, there's only 13 landscapes that deliver most of the forest  
**[0:36:52-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:52):**  emissions.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:53):**  Agricultural emissions is probably about 50.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:36:57):**  Most of the water, fresh water supply on this planet is in about a hundred landscapes.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:37:02):**  The biodiversity is absolutely concentrated into probably about 50 of those landscapes.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:37:09):**  It's broadly spread, but if you save 50, you save the majority of life on this planet,  
**[0:37:14-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:37:14):**  particularly the rainforests and the reefs.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:37:17):**  And then poverty is concentrated in perhaps a hundred landscapes and it often overlaps  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:37:21):**  with where the emissions come from and where the biodiversity is.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:37:25):**  So our theory is that if you can save and sustainably manage a hundred landscapes, if  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:37:33):**  you can get them to the point where they meet the SDG goals, then you meet the SDGs on the  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:37:38):**  planet.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:37:39):**  And, you know, our costings at the moment for building a landscape program and getting  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:37:43):**  investment is somewhere between a hundred million and a billion dollars per landscape.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:37:49):**  So that's more expensive than a fighter jet, but cheaper than an aircraft carrier.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:37:55):**  And there's no reason why the world couldn't find that money.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:00):**  We have to now build the machinery to actually deliver on that vision.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:04):**  And that's what we're doing with the Landscape Finance Lab and our many partners.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:09):**  It makes it extremely doable, scary and complex at the same time, but it at least gives you  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:15):**  a sense that it is possible because you have been working also, for instance, with climate  
**[0:38:20-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:20):**  bonds or with the large, large financial institutions that are mostly debt-based to connect at some  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:27):**  point with them and get the real big money flowing into these systems, right?  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:31):**  Yeah, so green bonds, the green bond universe this year will be $250 billion worth of investment  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:37):**  in the green bonds.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:39):**  So these are, this is money that is connected to climate benefits, to sustainability benefits.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:46):**  It's exactly the sort of money we want to get into the landscapes.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:49):**  So the next question is just simply, how do you build landscape bonds where we've just  
**[0:38:53-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:53):**  had some...  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:54):**  You say simply, but that's not very simple.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:56):**  Yeah, maybe not so easy.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:38:57):**  Because if I do a green bond, very specifically focused on large solar parks or more electric  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:04):**  trains if I'm still driving some diesel or electric cars, I mean, I've seen many of them  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:08):**  and they're very, very singular and linear.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:12):**  And if there's one thing that a landscape isn't, it's not that.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:16):**  So how would you, I mean, we're still in the early phases, but I'm very curious about this  
**[0:39:19-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:19):**  transition finance, especially the large chunks of money.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:22):**  How would you envision this process to unfold over the next couple of years?  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:25):**  Well, if you'd asked someone about wind farms and energy parks 10, 20 years ago, they would  
**[0:39:31-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:31):**  have said it was horribly complex and we, you know, we've got little projects here and  
**[0:39:34-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:34):**  we don't know how to do it.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:36):**  Ah, that's true.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:37):**  Now it's just completely obvious.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:38):**  And that's where we are right now with land use.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:42):**  And landscapes are one tool to get to scale.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:46):**  And we, with the lab, we have a systematic process to just step people through easily  
**[0:39:52-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:52):**  all of these complex stages.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:39:55):**  And we're confident that we can get people to a point where their landscape will have  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:00):**  a strong plan and financing to deliver on the SDGs.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:04):**  Now, how do we make that just standard practice in the industry?  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:08):**  That's another thing altogether.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:09):**  But I was, I took great heart when I, when I learned the story of George Stevenson and  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:15):**  the development of the railways, you know, back in the 1840s.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:19):**  He was in exactly the same problem.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:20):**  They, you know, in the 1840s, he had a railway, he had rails, they knew that they could build  
**[0:40:27-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:27):**  something.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:28):**  But what they did was, that was quite extraordinary, was create the railway company, which brought  
**[0:40:33-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:33):**  together the politicians, the financiers and the engineers.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:39):**  And within 10 years, they'd raised the equivalent of the GDP of England.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:44):**  They'd built 10,000 kilometres worth of railways.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:48):**  In 10 years, they've invented how to build tunnels and bridges, you know, Brunel's bridges  
**[0:40:55-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:55):**  are part of that.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:40:57):**  So it is possible, but it does take a lot of thought to take these complicated pieces  
**[0:41:04-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:04):**  and put them into a simple machine.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:07):**  That's as many people around the world working on that challenge right at the moment and  
**[0:41:12-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:12):**  linking it up to the financing.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:14):**  It's really, really quite exciting times.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:16):**  It's extremely exciting.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:18):**  And I want to be conscious of your time because you have landscapes to manage, to help manage.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:23):**  I want to end with a final question, if you could wave your magic wand and tomorrow morning  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:28):**  wake up, I mean, it's early morning now, but you will wake up and you have changed one  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:33):**  thing in the, let's say the regenerative land use space.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:37):**  What would it be?  
**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:38):**  Wow.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:39):**  Wow.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:40):**  That's a tough one, Kurt.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:43):**  It would be that we would all focus on just three, four, maybe five things that we're  
**[0:41:50-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:50):**  trying to achieve on this planet.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:52):**  The world has come together around climate emissions.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:41:57):**  So carbon, measuring carbon is pretty clear now.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:02):**  And the financial world has now taken that on and doing it.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:07):**  But can we do the same for biodiversity?  
**[0:42:10-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:10):**  Can we do the same for sustainable, ecological, regenerative agriculture and other production  
**[0:42:18-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:18):**  types?  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:19):**  Are there just simple ways that we can measure these things, attach those measurements to  
**[0:42:24-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:24):**  the finance world and make sure that you only get money or you get money much cheaper if  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:31):**  you're meeting those goals, that'll shift things really rapidly.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:35):**  And it's happening right at the moment.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:36):**  The EU is creating a thing called the sustainable finance taxonomy, which is the worst possible  
**[0:42:42-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:42):**  term.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:43):**  It sounds really boring, but it's...  
**[0:42:45-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:45):**  I know, but they're trying to get Regenec in it as well.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:48):**  Exactly.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:49):**  And Joe is working on it and some other friends.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:51):**  Exactly.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:52):**  And if they can get the right measures to say, this is good Regen Ag or forestry or  
**[0:42:59-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:42:59):**  fisheries or whatever, and this is not, it helped the bankers can then tick yes to a  
**[0:43:07-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:43:07):**  certain type of investment and no to the rest.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:43:09):**  And the economies of the world will shift quite rapidly to sustainability or at least  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:43:15):**  a lot faster than they are at the moment.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:43:18):**  That's an exciting process.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:43:20):**  The Chinese are following it, the Californians are going to implement it.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:43:24):**  And if they do, the Americans will, and then the rest of the world will follow it.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:43:28):**  But it's at a crucial point at the moment.

**[0:47:43-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:47:43):**  It's not a list of investable deals.

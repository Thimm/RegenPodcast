**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:00:25):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:00:30):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:00:44):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:00:53):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:20):**  Welcome to for sure a wide ranging interview with friend of the show back after a while.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:25):**  I think it was probably the beginning of the year, the end of last year.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:28):**  I'm so happy to have him back here.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:30):**  He's the chief innovation officer at HowGood, but so much more, including a farmer, obviously  
**[0:01:34-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:34):**  applying regenerative practices.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:36):**  Welcome back, Ethan Soloveyev.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:38):**  Thank you, Kim.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:39):**  Great to be here.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:40):**  So we have a lot of things to get through and I know you have a hard stop, so we're  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:43):**  going to start immediately.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:45):**  Let's start with some news as we've done a number of news episodes last year and there  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:49):**  is actually a lot of news.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:50):**  This is not going to be a full news episode.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:52):**  We're going to talk about HowGood, what you've launched and everything that's happening  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:55):**  there, but let's get a few, let's say big headlines.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:01:57):**  We're talking the 16th of November, 2020.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:01):**  What's on your mind in terms of region egg or region business in general?  
**[0:02:05-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:05):**  Regeneration is moving very quickly now.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:08):**  I think we have been in an exponential growth curve for quite some time and wow, can we  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:14):**  see it, especially in the last few months.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:16):**  There's been some major announcements by really large companies.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:20):**  Cargo, you know, one of the big four commodity agricultural companies in the world announced  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:26):**  that they were going to 10x what General Mills had said a few years before and they said,  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:30):**  we're putting 10 million acres into regenerative agriculture, or I think they use a similar  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:34):**  language of we're going to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:38):**  That's pretty significant.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:40):**  Almost at the same time, might even have been the same week, Walmart announced that it was  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:45):**  going to be a regenerative company.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:46):**  They didn't even say regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:49):**  They just said we're going to be regenerative company.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:51):**  And that was surprising, shocking, even hard to believe, certainly, especially I think  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:02:57):**  because they were not following the trend that had been happening.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:01):**  So it was like, there's this linear thing and we'll see it later this year when we update  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:04):**  our regenerative agriculture industry, Matt.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:06):**  I was going to ask you about it.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:07):**  So there's going to be an update, which is good.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:08):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:09):**  There's been a growth in the number of companies saying regenerative ag, regenerative ag, regenerative  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:13):**  ag.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:14):**  And this is almost like a mycelial thing went sideways and went over there.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:18):**  And we saw little clues of it from the Forum for the Future, did their regenerative agriculture  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:22):**  report funded by the Walmart Foundation earlier in the year.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:27):**  So there's a little like sense of it.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:29):**  But then all of a sudden, Walmart comes out and says, we're going to be a regenerative  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:32):**  company.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:33):**  And what they talked about with that was a good bit of ecological stuff.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:37):**  They said we plan to be net zero, we're going to conserve this many millions of acres.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:42):**  But they didn't actually say much about regeneration, certainly not from the deep regenerative business  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:48):**  perspective that has also been growing very quickly.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:51):**  And so I'm very fascinated to see if they can pull it off.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:55):**  My hunch is they won't be able to because they haven't really seen any signs except  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:03:59):**  for a little bit from the CEO that they can think regeneratively.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:04:03):**  But it is a clear sign of the growth of the buzzword.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:04:07):**  Yeah, we're in the hype cycle, definitely climbing up the hype mountain at the moment.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:04:12):**  Actually, and whether or not Walmart does regenerative agriculture or figures out how  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:04:17):**  to become regenerative, which I hope they do, but I think they have a long way to go  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:04:20):**  in the business side to do that.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:04:23):**  That was a major signal to all of their suppliers and to all of the major companies.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:04:28):**  That if you have ingredients, if you have brands that are using ingredients that have  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:04:33):**  been grown using one to 20 regenerative practices, you can knock on the door and say, look, guys  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:04:39):**  and girls, we have something you should be selling this because...  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:04:42):**  And even beyond that, like the general customer awareness that regenerative, what is, I don't  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:04:46):**  even know what that word means.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:04:48):**  Now Walmart saying it, so many CEOs are now thinking, wow, what is that?  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:04:52):**  So I think one of the things that means is that any interest that we've seen so far in  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:04:58):**  our work on regenerative agriculture, on regenerative business, on decision-making, on supply chains,  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:03):**  any work you've done on investing in regenerative agriculture, there is a big wave of interest  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:09):**  coming in our direction.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:10):**  And I don't know, maybe you've experienced a bit of this yourself.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:14):**  No, absolutely.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:15):**  I think the podcast was already, I mean, the community and the podcast was already on,  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:18):**  let's say the way up in terms of just sheer amount of downloads, sheer amount of inbound  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:24):**  emails, people reaching out, people calling into the webinars we're doing, the Ask Me  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:28):**  Anything, the people on LinkedIn, et cetera, but definitely COVID and the focus on food  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:32):**  and the focus on environment, especially in our, let's say extended bubble has helped  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:37):**  that like every interview we've published so far has been doing better than the one  
**[0:05:41-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:41):**  before.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:42):**  And also the ones going back actually are still gaining quite a lot of listeners.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:46):**  And it's really compared to a year ago, it's a huge, huge growth in sheer number of interactions,  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:52):**  number of listeners, number of people reaching out and number of, not just the number of  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:05:57):**  people, also the kind of people like really experienced finance people reaching out, like  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:00):**  I want to set up a fund or I want to invest in this and this.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:03):**  And I've listened to a lot of the episodes and what do you think about that and that?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:06):**  So there's a lot happening that you maybe don't see on the podcast, like in the public  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:10):**  podcast one, because we publish max one a week, but there's a lot happening on the background  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:15):**  as well.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:16):**  And there's a lot of interactions happening and investments are happening.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:18):**  There are people using the podcast as a deal flow source, because it turns out it's a great  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:23):**  way not to do the diligence necessarily, but to build trust.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:26):**  Like if you spend an hour, an hour and a half with me and a guest, you have a good understanding  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:30):**  if you find that guests and the company interesting or not.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:33):**  And then you can reach out and people do it like investors reach out.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:35):**  I know family offices and private investors that reach out either through me and I'm always  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:38):**  happy to introduce, but also directly.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:41):**  And that's why we do it, like to make money flow to the people that are building things  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:45):**  to regenerate soil scale and oceans, let's not forget.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:49):**  So it's definitely, I feel that where the wave is catching up, like we're on the surfboard  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:53):**  and you feel that you're going up, although you cannot see it because everything else  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:06:56):**  is going up as well, but it's starting to bubble a lot faster and more vividly than  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:01):**  it has done.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:02):**  I mean, since I started following this space in 2011.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:05):**  It's very exciting.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:06):**  It's very exciting.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:07):**  And I think, I mean, it makes me wonder if the, like, if the actual entrepreneurs generating  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:12):**  deals, generating projects, investable opportunities, if that will even grow as fast as the demand  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:18):**  grows.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:19):**  No, I think it's, you're right.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:20):**  I think there's a shortage of, I think the money part is exploding.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:24):**  Like a lot of people trying to get in and we can talk about if they're investing in  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:27):**  a regenerative way.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:28):**  I mean, many of course are looking for the typical return, the typical speed, the typical  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:33):**  time horizon, et cetera.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:34):**  And I hope people learn or see that that's not the case here.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:39):**  Like this, we're talking about real economy.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:40):**  We're talking about nature.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:41):**  We're talking about a lot of things that take a longer time or different time horizons.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:46):**  But I think what we're missing, I'm not missing, but what we absolutely need more of is people  
**[0:07:50-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:50):**  building things in this space.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:51):**  And by things, I mean, entrepreneurial farmers, I mean, funds, investment vehicles, companies,  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:07:57):**  food companies, technology, everything else that we need for this revolution is going  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:02):**  to require companies to build things.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:04):**  And we definitely need more of that because there's going to be a lot of money trying  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:07):**  to get into the space and we need places to put it.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:10):**  It's almost kind of like, maybe we should start a like a venture studio or something  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:14):**  that actually, you know, we can see it very clearly from both of our perspectives and  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:18):**  we should just start building the companies and maybe raise the fund to do that.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:22):**  That would be fun.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:23):**  That would be fun.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:24):**  We're let's say in the background, we're playing with a few things.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:26):**  I know a few people that are on the venture studio model and trying to bring it to Regen  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:30):**  Eigenfood.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:31):**  Shout out to the ones that are listening and know that I'm talking about you.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:34):**  Hopefully an interview soon.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:35):**  That's definitely an invite.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:37):**  And it's, yeah, we need a lot of people that have experience.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:40):**  I was discussing it this morning with a very successful entrepreneur that turned his attention  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:44):**  and of his team to food and ag.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:46):**  And we need very experienced people that are experienced too, that have built stuff, that  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:50):**  have gathered teams that have raised potentially money, or at least have built companies.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:55):**  Could be big, could be small without experiencing building things.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:08:57):**  We need them desperately in the Regen Eigenfood space because we're going to need, we're running  
**[0:09:02-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:09:02):**  out of time and soil.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:09:04):**  So we're going to need people that have experience in building larger organizations, could be  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:09:08):**  NGOs as well, but we need people that have built organisms that can make this change  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:09:13):**  happen.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:09:14):**  So I'm inviting anybody to reach out if you're building such things.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:09:18):**  And because there is money in the space, there's going to be a lot more if the wave is correct.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:09:23):**  Not all of it is going to be applicable and relevant, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:09:26):**  But it definitely is a very interesting moment for the sector, honestly.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:09:31):**  Just picking up on something you said before about money looking at regenerative things,  
**[0:09:35-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:09:35):**  but maybe not doing it in a regenerative way.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:09:38):**  I thought I would also just call out a small paper published last month that was on this  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:09:43):**  exact topic of not just what do you invest in, but how do you invest and what's the deeper  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:09:49):**  why that motivates how you invest on four different levels from a more sort of extract  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:09:55):**  value to a do less harm to I want to do a bit of good to an actually regenerative way  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:01):**  of investing.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:02):**  And so that paper is called Food System Investing in a Regenerative Economy.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:06):**  And it's part of this larger collaborative that I imagine your listeners would be really  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:10):**  interested in, which is called the Regenerative Economy Collaborative and is a community of  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:15):**  practice that is writing on the concept of a regenerative economy from a regenerative  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:19):**  paradigm.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:20):**  So not just taking an older perspective of finance and saying, well, let's look at regeneration  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:26):**  and write about it, but actually a group of people who have been in some people for 40  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:30):**  years thinking and working in a regenerative way and saying, OK, what if we apply this  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:35):**  way of thinking to the economy?  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:38):**  And so there's been some really cool foundational articles on what it means to be an economic  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:43):**  shaper looking at modern portfolio theory, modern financial theory around regeneration.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:49):**  So there's a bunch of cool articles of which the one I wrote is just a small piece on these  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:53):**  different levels of investing.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:54):**  I really like the article.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:10:55):**  We'll link it below in the show notes on the website where you can find show notes.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:00):**  I think it's a crucial point because we cannot apply, quote unquote, traditional investing  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:05):**  because it's not so traditional.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:06):**  It's relatively recent.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:07):**  But let's say the model we've been, even the funds we've been using to invest in software  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:12):**  companies.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:13):**  I mean, it's I think it's ridiculous to imagine that that would work in food companies that  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:17):**  make food as medicine.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:18):**  Like it's a completely different set of variables.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:22):**  And then if you apply regenerative thinking to it, you really go four or five, six steps  
**[0:11:26-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:26):**  further.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:27):**  And I think we it's a continuum in a sense that we have definitely a number of investors  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:32):**  that really, really think deeply about it.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:34):**  But a big group of like are maybe at step three or four, like they're thinking, OK,  
**[0:11:38-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:38):**  so it was interesting.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:39):**  Agriculture has to change.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:41):**  Maybe I have to change slightly how I invest and then slowly you get sucked into it.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:45):**  I think some people are listening.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:46):**  No, no.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:47):**  What I'm talking about.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:48):**  And it's definitely a much deeper process than simply moving a bit of capital from one  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:53):**  agriculture practice to another, which is absolutely necessary.  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:57):**  Let's remove as much as possible.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:11:58):**  But this goes a lot further, which one of the reasons why I like this so much because  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:03):**  you have to start changing the way you think and operate to really imply or imply all the  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:09):**  regenerative practices you want to like it.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:11):**  You cannot escape the deep philosophical questions almost.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:14):**  Which is amazing when you talk to farmers that are applying regenerative practices,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:18):**  especially if they've been doing it for a while.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:19):**  They're a few of the most philosophical people you ever meet because they really thought  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:23):**  about this stuff.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:24):**  They thought about emergence.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:25):**  They thought about how they see it every day.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:27):**  They thought about observing.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:29):**  They see nature operating and you cannot help but become very, very philosophical.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:33):**  I can tell though that we haven't talked for a while because now you're using this term  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:36):**  regenerative practices like it's a thing that doesn't exist.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:39):**  It doesn't work.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:41):**  There's no such thing as a regenerative practice.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:43):**  I know.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:44):**  I switched from saying regenerative agriculture just as there's no definition, which I keep  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:49):**  pointing to your amazing article on the agriculture continuum.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:52):**  As a farm that are applying practices, in this case building soil, but that's too long.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:57):**  So I say regenerative practices, which is also incomplete.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:12:59):**  Why don't you say regenerative approaches?  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:02):**  Regenerative approaches is better because when you say practices, that just means the  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:07):**  farming practices that are the best practices everybody does, which doesn't actually work  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:10):**  because they're different in different places.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:12):**  What a regenerative approach is can actually be the mind and the principles and the decision  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:17):**  methodology and all of that.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:19):**  And then they may also do some practices, but when you say regenerative practices, it  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:23):**  makes everybody think there's a checklist of regenerative practices.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:25):**  I just got to do them and then I'm done, which is like the antithesis of I'm allergic to  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:29):**  that idea.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:30):**  I would try to pay attention to that.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:32):**  I'm trying to stop saying regenerative agriculture as like, okay, this is regenerative farmer.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:39):**  I get really allergic when people say that and try to be like, there's not such a thing.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:42):**  You can be applying practices for the people that don't want to go too deep into the stuff,  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:46):**  but your right approaches is a better term.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:49):**  At least in English, there's probably better words in all sorts of language, including  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:53):**  the indigenous languages from all over the world that we're doing regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:13:57):**  horticulture, regenerative life ways for so many thousands and millions of years.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:14:02):**  But English is a kind of funny, tricky language.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:14:05):**  And so it's all the more important to be that much more focused on it.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:14:09):**  But that actually connects to a point that I was going to make just before you started  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:14:12):**  saying practices again, which is what you were saying about how investors shift and  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:14:17):**  how they can kind of change.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:14:18):**  And you were talking about these different steps and I laid it out in four levels.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:14:22):**  I think one of the key things to have that happen, and I'm going this direction because  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:14:26):**  I think both you and I are working on this, is not just to have it be like an idea that  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:14:32):**  you read an article and then go do, but to actually grow communities of, I was about  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:14:38):**  to say practice, communities of practice.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:14:40):**  I know, I know, approach, you didn't say approach.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:14:43):**  So, you know, communities of practice, communities of integrity, of people who are working together  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:14:49):**  over time, who commit to coming together to be working their mind, not just talking about  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:14:55):**  practices, but noticing how do I think, how do I work disrupting that inner regenerative  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:00):**  paradigm that is so key for long-term change because it does take time.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:05):**  And I think it takes community in order to help evolve up those layers or step through  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:09):**  those steps you were talking about.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:11):**  Yeah, it's super interesting you bring it up because one of my, I would say one of my  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:15):**  day jobs, that's not true, I spent about a day a week at Tonic working with a lot of  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:18):**  impact investors.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:20):**  And we just launched the working group specifically on regenerative ag and food.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:24):**  And it's going to have, I mean, we just launched it, so we don't know how long it's going to  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:27):**  continue, but it's going to have that, at least we're planning to continuous touch points.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:32):**  And it's part of a lot of other work we're doing to basically take impact investors on  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:38):**  our journey.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:39):**  And this is a group of impact investors has a deep interest in soil and food.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:43):**  Some are new to the space.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:44):**  Some are much more experienced and have made a number of investments, but they're all have  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:47):**  expressed the interest to make more investments.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:49):**  And we're going to do it together.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:50):**  We're going to share the flow to diligence and looking at, we at Tonic are facilitating,  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:55):**  we're not doing the investments or the diligence, but bringing our members together that have  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:15:58):**  a deep interest in this specific topic and facilitate the connections, the learnings,  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:16:03):**  mistakes, and everything else to slowly start moving more of their portfolios.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:16:08):**  They are moving more of their portfolios towards this end.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:16:10):**  Of course, we're going to see a lot of different things and a lot of different levels of regeneration,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:16:14):**  a lot of different levels of approaches, and that's all fine, but it's also a very big  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:16:19):**  internal work, which I think through doing deals and looking at things, you're going  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:16:22):**  to discover a lot of things about the internal work that actually needs to happen on the,  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:16:27):**  almost in the backend.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:16:28):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:16:29):**  And in a similar vein, you know, my work at HowGood is working primarily in the food system  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:16:35):**  with agriculture, with supply and with some of the largest companies in the world.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:16:40):**  And so I have recently launched a regenerative supply innovation working group because so  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:16:47):**  many companies, both really cool, tiny startups and small but established players.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:16:53):**  And then some of the really largest companies in the world have said, we want to do regenerative  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:16:57):**  agriculture, we want regenerative supply, but there isn't a lot out there.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:01):**  And so, you know, just like we were talking about, where do we buy our ingredients?  
**[0:17:05-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:05):**  Where do we go to?  
**[0:17:06-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:06):**  Exactly.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:07):**  The demand is growing much faster than the supply.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:10):**  And so I just launched an invite only community and asked people to commit for a full year  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:17):**  to come together and work on supply in this innovation working group format that we do  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:23):**  using regenerative business technology.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:26):**  So it's not, you know, the same kind of multi-stakeholder complex, lowest common denominator approach  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:31):**  that is so prevalent.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:33):**  There's lots of examples out there.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:34):**  So I'm doing really great work, but this is a regenerative business way of thinking, but  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:40):**  we're going to have this group that's actually ending up being about 30 different companies  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:44):**  from the largest to the smallest.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:46):**  And are you looking at specific ingredients or looking at their specific questions around  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:50):**  ingredients or how would that?  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:53):**  Basically the curriculum is designed around each company.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:56):**  So everybody's going to be bringing their own supply system.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:17:59):**  I'm not offering any content.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:01):**  I'm not going to tell you how to do rice regeneratively or sugar or monk fruit or apples.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:06):**  I'm not doing any of that content.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:08):**  Apples you would know actually.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:09):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:10):**  That's where it gets hard is I have to...  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:12):**  Just as a side note, if you don't know, he's an apple farmer as well.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:15):**  So I'm going to be inviting processes and interactive work and sharing some of the regenerative  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:21):**  thinking frameworks so that each of the companies will work on and develop their own supply  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:26):**  system.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:27):**  Because if it were just so easy to say, oh, well, here's a regenerative supplier, there's  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:30):**  a regenerative supplier, then I just do that and tell people where it is.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:32):**  The reality is the supply isn't out there.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:35):**  And so you have to work in a regenerative way with your company, with the procurement  
**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:40):**  team, with the R&D team, with the marketing team, and then actually develop your supply  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:46):**  system to match your company, to match your products, to get it out of the marketplace.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:50):**  And that's not something you can do in a one-off workshop.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:54):**  That's something that needs a community of people thinking and figuring out how to do  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:58):**  it over time.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:18:59):**  And Walmart is part of that, or you haven't said any of that yet?  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:02):**  I can't say exactly who's participating in any of these fully super confidential invite  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:07):**  only.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:08):**  But still 40 players is a good amount.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:10):**  30.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:11):**  30 players, but still huge and small players for sure.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:14):**  And there's going to be an 80-20 rule, but that is a year, potentially a lot of change,  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:19):**  which some of it they might've done by themselves.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:20):**  It's not a way you run a control group, but I would be surprised if it didn't speed it  
**[0:19:24-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:24):**  up.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:25):**  It doesn't like significantly cut down a lot of these things to make it very concrete.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:31):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:33):**  And I think the commitment is key.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:34):**  Some people say, Oh, can I just come and try it out?  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:37):**  I'm not sure if I'm going to get value out of it.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:38):**  Let me just come for one session.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:40):**  I say, no, you can't do that.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:42):**  And they pay as well for the full year.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:44):**  Like it's, yeah, so it's a full education.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:48):**  You have to commit, you've got skin in the game and you're going to, I say, you have  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:52):**  to show up for all 12 sessions.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:53):**  And they say, Oh, can I just swap out for a different person?  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:56):**  Cause I can't make this.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:19:57):**  So I said, no, you can't do that because it's not like I'm delivering.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:00):**  I'm not giving you the knowledge.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:01):**  So that you can watch the webinar recorded.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:04):**  Exactly.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:05):**  I'm developing you as an individual person in your capability to see systems and work  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:10):**  towards regeneration and thinking in a regenerative way.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:12):**  And you have to show up and you have to do the exercise and you have to be thinking on  
**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:15):**  it in order for that to happen.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:17):**  You can't just have somebody come in and get that and transfer it.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:20):**  It's like it's actual human development, but it's about how humans learn over time.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:25):**  And these are the people who are decision makers that will guide the work that these  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:28):**  companies do.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:29):**  Super, super cool.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:30):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:31):**  So I can't say a lot about it, but I wanted to say a little bit about it and also just  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:35):**  say, you know, this one is full and starting this week, but I think based on the interest,  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:39):**  we'll do another one in six months or something like that.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:42):**  And so, yeah, another cohort.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:45):**  Very.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:46):**  So they should, if they want an invite, they should reach out to you.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:48):**  Exactly.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:49):**  And then what is Lattice?  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:51):**  I mean, one of the reasons we're doing this check-in interview, and there are always 6  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:55):**  million others, but one of the main reasons we connect often, but we connect to let's  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:20:59):**  do a check-in is Lattice.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:01):**  And part of HowGood, can you explain what it is and why it's such a game changer for  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:05):**  the sector?  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:06):**  Yeah, I'm really excited about Lattice.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:09):**  This is an impact platform.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:10):**  It's software as a service that brings together basically the last 14 years of HowGood's research  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:17):**  on global supply systems, agriculture, environment, human rights, labor risk, animal welfare,  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:23):**  and brings it all into one database and then puts it immediately into the hands of decision  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:29):**  makers at primarily food producing companies.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:32):**  There's also Health and Beauty coming, but one large Health and Beauty company has gotten  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:38):**  exclusivity so there won't be Health and Beauty available broadly for a while.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:42):**  But for food, you know, we're launched and getting it out there.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:44):**  So I think maybe for listeners who haven't heard about HowGood, I should just say a little  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:48):**  bit there and that'll give context for Lattice.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:52):**  So HowGood is a tiny venture backed startup that has built the world's largest database  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:21:58):**  of product and ingredients sustainability.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:01):**  So we look at 127 individual different sustainability metrics.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:06):**  We have 33,000 different ingredients, chemicals, and materials in the database.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:11):**  So that's everything for food.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:12):**  It's everything for Health and Beauty.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:14):**  That's everything for packaging.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:16):**  And then we've pulled over 450 different data sets, which are a huge array of things from,  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:24):**  you know, life cycle assessment data to NGO reports to academic publications.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:30):**  We've pulled and centralized and harmonized all of this data so that we can rapidly assess  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:35):**  any ingredient and any product in the industry.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:38):**  We've got a million products already in the database at the individual UPC level, thousands  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:43):**  and thousands of...  
**[0:22:44-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:44):**  Meaning this specific peanut butter and this specific...  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:47):**  Exactly.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:48):**  Steak, olive oil.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:50):**  Steak, this specific granola bottle.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:53):**  Mostly supermarket focused, right?  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:54):**  That's the...  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:55):**  Exactly.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:56):**  So we have a million of those.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:22:57):**  Well, I mean, HowGood started in small natural food and specialty.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:02):**  So we have a huge number of those really, you know, cutting edge products, but then  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:06):**  we're also working with large players like Ajo Deljes, which has 2000 stores in the US,  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:11):**  4000 stores in Europe.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:13):**  And you know, we have 95 or greater percent coverage of every single thing in their stores.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:18):**  So it is broad scale, but then we also are always keeping our eyes on what's popping  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:23):**  the cool innovative brands that are out there and assessing those also.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:26):**  So for years we've done this, assessing individual products.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:30):**  But what happened was we realized we're gathering more data than the retailers themselves were  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:35):**  using.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:36):**  And so then we thought, okay, somebody must be interested in this finer grain data in  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:40):**  not just like, is this a great product for the world or is this just a good product for  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:44):**  the world?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:45):**  But like how many kilograms of CO2 equivalents per kilogram of this material?  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:49):**  How much water in a stressed area is being used?  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:51):**  What is the specific labor risk and working conditions in the supply chain of all the  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:55):**  20 ingredients in this product?  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:23:57):**  And so we partnered with Denone and developed this platform called Lattice that basically  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:24:04):**  takes all of that information and puts it on the screen in front of you at the click  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:24:07):**  of a button.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:24:08):**  So if you're a product developer and you're interested in a new ingredient, I don't know,  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:24:13):**  sumac or acerola cherry or a monk fruit, but you don't know anything about it, your procurement  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:24:18):**  team is overloaded, doesn't have time to look into it, your sustainability team's working  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:24:23):**  on the report, you got to get some information and make a decision about your product.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:24:27):**  You just click into Lattice, you type in that ingredient, it pops up and then you can get  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:24:31):**  any one of these many, many different metrics and instantaneously understand them.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:24:36):**  But you don't have to have a degree in ecology or human rights or life cycle assessment in  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:24:44):**  order to understand it because we use the spectrums.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:24:48):**  So just like you've been working on the regenerative agriculture spectrum, we use this concept  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:24:52):**  of a spectrum from the most degenerative to the most regenerative and have a simple color  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:24:56):**  scale between them and lay that across greenhouse gas emissions, water, biodiversity, soil health,  
**[0:25:03-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:03):**  labor risk, processing.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:05):**  So very quickly, without looking at any decimals or really having to know that much, you can  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:10):**  see the colors and go, oh shit, there's a red spot here.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:14):**  That's high water usage.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:16):**  Oh no, there's cocoa from West Africa, there's a high labor risk.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:20):**  So you can very quickly see and then you can improve the product.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:25):**  So it's great for baselining, right?  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:27):**  You could baseline an entire thousands of products, product portfolio in a matter of  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:32):**  weeks and just have an actual baseline there.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:35):**  And then you can go into an individual product and say, well, what if I changed out this  
**[0:25:40-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:40):**  almond?  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:41):**  What if I changed out this apple instead of getting a conventional one from China?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:46):**  What if I got a regenerative one from Chile?  
**[0:25:49-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:49):**  Or what if I got a fair trade organic one from Ecuador?  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:55):**  And then immediately it changes the metrics.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:25:57):**  So you can see real time, you don't have to wait six months, you don't have to hire an  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:00):**  outside consultant to check on it.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:02):**  You just make that change and boom, you can see how the product improves.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:05):**  And how deep does it go in a sense like, okay, I'll change the one from Chile to Ecuador  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:10):**  for instance.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:11):**  Is it, I don't think it is, but I'm asking, is it at a farm level in a sense?  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:15):**  Because between farm and farm, obviously it could be enormous differences.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:19):**  Neighbor and neighbor is a whole different game.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:21):**  Maybe not because of the labor risk and political risk.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:24):**  The risk, yes, the actual practices and approaches are different.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:28):**  How granular do you get with almonds or apples or these ingredients as the difference could  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:34):**  be whatever X?  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:36):**  We can get all the way down to farm level.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:40):**  If the data is there, I think.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:41):**  If the data is there.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:42):**  It's not that you're going to Ecuador and say, okay, this farm is here and that farm.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:45):**  That is not how goods work, but much of that data is available and through our partners  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:51):**  and through something that's happened more and more, which I want to talk a bit more  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:26:54):**  about around supply, we're getting more and more detailed data down to the farm level.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:00):**  But the majority is not the majority starts at these heuristic levels of granularity and  
**[0:27:06-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:06):**  industry averages.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:08):**  So our approach is we take and can use the most granular level of data that is available.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:14):**  So if you are a company and you know, you're sourcing from this farm and you have soil  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:18):**  tests and you have modeling from any of the other platforms from cool farm, cool from  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:23):**  the S.A.I. from granular, from anything you have, we can take that very detailed data  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:28):**  and put it into the system and then you can pop it up next to the industry average, next  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:33):**  to the state average, next to, you know, the all the farms that are using organic certification  
**[0:27:39-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:39):**  in that region.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:40):**  So you can see these multiple layers of detail.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:43):**  One of the challenges that I think is out there in the world is that many people think  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:46):**  you have to have that farm level data for every single point in your supply chain.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:51):**  And that's impossible.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:52):**  You just nobody has that yet.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:54):**  And so then people are stuck.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:55):**  They stop and they say, well, we could never know all that.  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:58):**  So we're not going to make any decisions.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:27:59):**  That is a that's a waste of time.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:01):**  We don't have time for that in the world right now.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:02):**  We need to clean up way faster and then get better over time.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:06):**  Exactly.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:07):**  So we give you highly accurate directional information right from the start.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:11):**  Because if you swap like the worst two or three ingredients and you swap them for a  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:15):**  lot better one, for sure, like your average score changes dramatically because it's in  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:20):**  the worst ones where probably the most negative impact is and not just the top one or two  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:25):**  ingredients you use and you're you're super happy about because they already fair trade  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:28):**  and organically certified and ROC, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:31):**  Exactly.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:32):**  So we'll work with whatever data is there.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:36):**  And then over time, like if you don't know anything about many times, you know, various  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:40):**  companies that we have talked to and work with, they don't actually know where their  
**[0:28:44-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:44):**  supply.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:45):**  They don't know where in the country it's coming from, which is understandable because  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:47):**  of the opacity and complexity of the global supply system.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:51):**  So that's where you start.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:52):**  We start there and we can actually many times companies will come to us and say, you don't  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:56):**  know where our sugar is coming from.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:57):**  We haven't told you that.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:28:58):**  They say, well, yeah, so where is it coming from?  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:00):**  They say, well, we don't know either, but let's go check with our suppliers and say,  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:04):**  OK, before you go, let me tell you this.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:06):**  We think based on where your manufacturer and the scale and what your manufacturing,  
**[0:29:11-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:11):**  you are most likely sourcing that cane sugar from Dominican Republic and go ask your suppliers  
**[0:29:18-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:18):**  that.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:19):**  And then they'll come back and they'll say, how did you know that's where we were sourcing?  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:22):**  And that's the power of the heuristics that How Good is Built is even if you don't know,  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:26):**  we actually probably do know where it's coming from and some details about how it's produced.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:30):**  And then over time, if you can get more details from your supplier or directly, then we can  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:35):**  add that in and the system gets more and more precise.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:40):**  But there's no excuses for not getting a look at it now and starting to make decisions in  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:45):**  the right direction.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:46):**  You have to start mapping.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:47):**  We're just as honestly as impact investors.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:49):**  There's no excuse now for not mapping your portfolio and have a good understanding of  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:54):**  what you actually invested in.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:56):**  And there might be some nasty surprises and skeleton in the closet.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:29:59):**  You thought, I'm really still part of that fossil fuel company.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:02):**  And how did I actually and they probably have more damage than your amazing few angel investments  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:08):**  into something solar, et cetera.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:10):**  You can never do like clean up, get to a good baseline and start going deeper from there.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:15):**  But the cleaning up part or getting into a good overview, like having an understanding  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:18):**  what you actually own.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:19):**  I know Lisa Pritzker always like actually do a good research into what you own and then  
**[0:30:26-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:26):**  start from there.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:27):**  But unless you know that, unless you know what kind of ingredients you're even buying  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:29):**  and where they're from, where do you start going and improve from there?  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:33):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:34):**  And I'm sure one of the things your listeners are thinking about right now is, could you  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:38):**  combine forces with what Koon just said and what Ethan was talking about and do how good  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:42):**  software for investments?  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:44):**  And I'm going to say yes, but don't email me about it right now because I saw a button  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:50):**  on there for investors.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:51):**  Actually, there's so much interest and we are working on it.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:30:55):**  It's harder with investment portfolios than it is with food products because you know,  
**[0:31:01-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:01):**  so many funds, you can't see exactly what it is.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:03):**  Or even if you know what the funds are investing in, you can't see exactly where the holdings  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:06):**  are.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:07):**  So I've been doing some, I've done some methodology and been working with some really cool folks  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:10):**  thinking about this to build out some of the modeling portfolios that would basically allow  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:14):**  you to type in a ticker symbol and then see what the impact is in all of these different  
**[0:31:19-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:19):**  metrics.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:20):**  So that's on the way.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:22):**  It's not here yet.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:23):**  The public side is probably easier because there's so much data on the private side is  
**[0:31:27-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:27):**  where it gets really, really common.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:29):**  It's what we see at least internally, like we're mapping a lot of the portfolios of our  
**[0:31:32-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:32):**  members, which they share with us voluntarily, obviously.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:35):**  And it's really, really difficult to, and we're building some pieces, I will put a link  
**[0:31:39-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:39):**  in on Tonic Tracer.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:41):**  We're building some pieces of software on that on both sides.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:43):**  So basically let the investor declare why they made that investment, both on the impact  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:47):**  theme level and the SCG level, because it could be very, very different.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:50):**  And then going to the investment or the investment fund and ask the same thing like, what are  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:54):**  you tracking?  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:55):**  What are your metrics?  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:56):**  What are your KPIs?  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:31:57):**  And hopefully if we do that enough times, then we don't have to ask that fund again  
**[0:32:01-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:01):**  because they already mentioned it.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:02):**  So we get a database with at least all the impact funds and let's say the larger direct  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:07):**  deals, et cetera, that have declared what they are tracking.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:09):**  Are they tracking inequality?  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:10):**  Are they tracking CO2?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:12):**  Are they tracking of their portfolio companies, of their company themselves, et cetera, et  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:15):**  cetera.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:16):**  So not every single investor who is going to reach out again and ask, okay, are you  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:19):**  tracking that?  
**[0:32:20-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:20):**  Can you please go back?  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:21):**  That needs to be, I wouldn't say centralized, but database somewhere because we need to  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:26):**  know and pension funds need to know, investors need to know, and it needs to be tracked.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:29):**  You'd be surprised how much of it is tracked and how sometimes how little of it is tracked.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:34):**  Like, okay, just seeing the inequality data, like how many female founders do you have  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:40):**  in your fund?  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:41):**  And many people have not even asked that question ever.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:43):**  And it's really, it starts with that question, just asking it.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:46):**  Well, and then this can actually connect something to, which is the next level of Lattice.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:52):**  So my role is chief innovation officer.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:54):**  So we've designed Lattice two years ago.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:56):**  It launched with Danone as a primary partner.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:32:58):**  There's a bunch of others that are coming online.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:00):**  There's also a number of other companies that are using the data that sits behind Lattice  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:04):**  even to communicate publicly.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:06):**  So Chipotle restaurant, fast casual, excellent restaurant here in the U S with really high  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:11):**  quality standards on its sourcing is also using the data behind it and they're putting  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:15):**  it on their receipts.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:16):**  Every time you buy a burrito or you buy a bowl, you actually get some numbers about  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:21):**  the relative amount, less of CO2 that went into the atmosphere.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:25):**  It's powered by how good data is powered directly by how good data.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:28):**  So there's a lot more use cases of this.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:30):**  This is also something I see that's happening, not just how good is doing this, but that  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:34):**  sort of information insight on carbon footprint is going to be growing very, very, very quickly.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:39):**  True price did a pop-up shop in Amsterdam.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:42):**  Like what is this coffee actually cost and what does this, and they put like the real  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:45):**  cost and then the actual climate cost plus social, et cetera.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:49):**  And I think there's a discount discount supermarket in Germany that has been communicating the  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:54):**  real price, which you would never expect from this country, but they have been communicating  
**[0:33:58-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:33:58):**  the real cost actually of your chocolate bar, of your bag of potatoes, of your, and I made  
**[0:34:02-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:02):**  quite some headlines.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:03):**  I will see if I can find a link.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:05):**  Expect to see this growing significantly and how good has some other offerings that are  
**[0:34:10-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:10):**  about to launch in this space.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:12):**  But the thing that we're really heading towards that I'm now turning my attention onto is  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:18):**  how do you build up the supplier side of our database so that when you find out, Oh, a  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:24):**  fair trade organic chocolate is actually going to score a lot better in the system.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:29):**  Well, what suppliers, what co-ops have fair trade organic chocolate at the scale that  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:34):**  you need it to produce or, Oh, you want, you know, a dry farm Spanish almond.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:38):**  Well, where do you actually get that?  
**[0:34:40-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:40):**  So now what we're building out and the first thing we're going to do, and the reason I'm  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:44):**  mentioning it here is because some of your listeners are from the production and supply  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:48):**  side of things.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:50):**  We're not going to try to boil the ocean and put every single supplier in the world of  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:54):**  every type of material that's out there.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:56):**  We're going to start with the regenerative supply.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:34:59):**  So anyone who's out there who's actually producing high quality or even heading toward transitional  
**[0:35:03-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:03):**  to regenerative, we're going to get you into the database first so that our partners, small  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:09):**  brands and large bands can click in and say, Oh, exactly here, this will make my product  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:14):**  better, but where do I get this?  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:16):**  Here's a link to, you know, this supplier or that supplier that might actually have  
**[0:35:20-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:20):**  that available.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:21):**  And that's the next thing I'm working on building is the supplier side of the database.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:26):**  Super exciting.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:27):**  We have to check in way more often than this, and we have to be very conscious of your time  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:30):**  because you have another call coming up and I want to ask the last question that I've  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:33):**  been asking, but I never asked you is what if you would wake up tomorrow and you have  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:38):**  a 1 billion, we mentioned it with a bit with the venture studio, but what if you would  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:42):**  have a $1 billion investment fund and you'll be free to invest it, whatever you like, what  
**[0:35:47-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:47):**  would that portfolio look like?  
**[0:35:49-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:49):**  I think I would launch a venture studio for each major climate geographic zone in the  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:35:57):**  world and have them centered in that place on a farm.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:01):**  Yeah, probably on a farm.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:02):**  Like one of the things about regenerative agriculture is that it is unique to each place  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:07):**  and expresses the essence of each place.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:10):**  So I think, you know, starting one in each major geographic climactic zone would be a  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:15):**  good, like a Mediterranean one and a deep tropics one and a, you know, like colds tundra  
**[0:36:21-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:21):**  one, right?  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:22):**  You'd have each of those, but then one of the things that those would be tasked with  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:27):**  doing is understanding the different life sheds, not just watersheds.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:32):**  Watersheds is like a, it's the wrong way to think about it, separating out water from  
**[0:36:35-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:35):**  the rest of life.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:36):**  But it's easy when a drop falls here and where does it go?  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:39):**  I mean, people, it's a linear thing.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:41):**  Right.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:42):**  So we'd be able to see a whole life shed, the economic, historical, cultural, biological,  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:47):**  ecological, spiritual, psychological, you know, entity of life.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:51):**  So we'd find those different life sheds all over the world and support each of them to  
**[0:36:56-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:56):**  be growing investment communities within them.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:36:59):**  So the most powerful thing I would do with investment is multiply the investment by growing  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:02):**  these life shed centric investment communities.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:05):**  And I read a little bit about this in the article we talked about.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:08):**  Okay.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:09):**  That's one thing.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:10):**  I think it's a good approach and I wouldn't, I don't think I'd spend any money on the government  
**[0:37:13-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:13):**  side of things on policy.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:15):**  A lot of people think policy is a good idea.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:16):**  I agree.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:17):**  I think it's really important.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:18):**  It's not for me.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:19):**  I'm going to take a business route.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:21):**  A lot of people are doing it.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:22):**  I think if you look at the, my decision making framework or my, it's of effective altruism,  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:27):**  et cetera, is it neglected?  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:29):**  Is it, is I think the most crucial question and policy, I'm very happy other people are  
**[0:37:34-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:34):**  doing it.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:35):**  Let's say a lot of people decide why you're not interviewing people of the European Union,  
**[0:37:38-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:38):**  et cetera.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:40):**  It's just not for me.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:41):**  And I think luckily a lot of attention is going there, but sorry, go ahead.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:45):**  I think, well, I think you and I both have a bias for action.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:48):**  And so we see that the investment states and the business phase are places where action  
**[0:37:51-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:51):**  can happen quickly without getting a lot about.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:54):**  And so that's actually where I would put some of the rest of that billion dollars is use  
**[0:37:59-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:37:59):**  it as an instrument to get deep connection with the CEOs and boards of the major companies  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:38:08):**  in the world that have to do with agriculture.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:38:10):**  Because when you can get CEO and board level thinking change on not just like, oh, we should  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:38:17):**  do regenerative agriculture, but as we discussed earlier, you know, I want those people committing  
**[0:38:22-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:38:22):**  to an amount of time in a room each month together with their top people, regenerating  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:38:29):**  how they think about agriculture, about supply, about investment, because that is what will  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:38:35):**  quickly shift the whole.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:38:36):**  And you can look at, I think Paul Polman, you know, from Unilever now has something  
**[0:38:40-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:38:40):**  that is basically aiming to do this.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:38:42):**  I wouldn't do it exactly the same way and it would be more from a regenerative place,  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:38:46):**  but something along those lines I think would be a really, really key.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:38:50):**  And then I probably invest, there's a bunch of just purely to make money off that billion.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:38:55):**  There's a whole bunch of, I think really cool farmland investments that are more mature  
**[0:39:00-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:00):**  that we don't need as much research.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:01):**  We don't need as much, you know, venture development, but there are perennial cropping systems in  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:06):**  each climate in the world.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:08):**  And I would do, you know, a regenerative real estate model similar to, you know, or along  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:13):**  the lines of what Paul at SLM and some of the other great folks that you've interviewed  
**[0:39:17-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:17):**  in the funds are doing.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:19):**  But there's a couple of tweaks towards perennial crops that I would focus on and then also  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:24):**  continue to think about the investment value of the real estate itself and finding ways  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:28):**  to monetize that as well as the production.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:31):**  Because I never really want to be trying to pull investment money off of farmers back,  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:35):**  but I think there's some tested ways we could get a lot.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:38):**  So that would be probably like 50%, 30%, 20% I think is how to do that.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:45):**  So if anybody has a mirror laying around, you can also definitely reach out to Ethan  
**[0:39:49-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:49):**  and it will be a fun manager tomorrow morning.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:51):**  It will be a lot of fun.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:53):**  I like the question because I mean, you're used to think about numbers and larger numbers,  
**[0:39:59-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:39:59):**  but some people in the space are not.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:00):**  And I love that decision making where, okay, what would you focus on because you cannot  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:04):**  do everything and a billion is large enough to sort of say, okay, a million doesn't really  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:08):**  matter.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:09):**  So I really need some kind of structure and decision making framework and focus to do  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:13):**  this.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:14):**  Otherwise it just, I would just get drowned and it triggers interesting thoughts.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:18):**  It's not because it's a billion, it could be a hundred billion, it could be a hundred  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:20):**  million.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:21):**  It doesn't really matter.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:22):**  It just needs to be a large amount enough to trigger somebody to say, okay, I need some  
**[0:40:25-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:25):**  kind of prioritization.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:27):**  Otherwise I just get lost.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:29):**  And with that, I think we're done for this session.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:32):**  We're going to be back soon.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:33):**  I think, I don't think it should last.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:35):**  It should be as long as we did last time.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:37):**  I think it's almost a year at the end of last year when we did the map, actually, there  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:40):**  was when we did the map launch.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:42):**  So we should check in around that again.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:45):**  Any last thoughts for this version?  
**[0:40:46-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:46):**  I do have one last thought that's in a different direction than we've touched most of this,  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:50):**  but I'll just put it out there.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:51):**  There's been criticism towards regenerative agriculture recently, especially after case  
**[0:40:55-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:55):**  the ground came online and a whole bunch of things.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:40:58):**  And I think for good reason, there's been some questions about the integrity and the  
**[0:41:04-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:04):**  whitewashed nature of regenerative agriculture, basically taking the work of black and indigenous  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:10):**  and Latino and Asian farmers and people of color all over the world who have been doing  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:14):**  incredible agricultural practices and approaches and life ways for a really long time.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:20):**  We had Chris Newman on the show a few weeks ago, which was great.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:23):**  I think this is a really cool place for everyone to explore how goods innovation series is  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:30):**  following this thread.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:31):**  We have a number of amazing indigenous black people of color, farmers and people from all  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:37):**  over the food system speaking on this, especially from an angle of biodiversity and cultural  
**[0:41:42-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:42):**  diversity.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:43):**  And so those are free.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:44):**  That's how goods innovation series online.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:46):**  You can find that.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:47):**  We can put that in the show notes.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:48):**  But then also just digging into that realm and understanding what is the indigenous ancestry  
**[0:41:54-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:41:54):**  of each crop, of each product, of each place that you're in and just going on a, a not  
**[0:42:00-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:42:00):**  triggered and not defensive and not, uh, don't do white fragility and just really like dig  
**[0:42:05-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:42:05):**  into it and grieve and learn.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:42:08):**  And there's so much beauty there and there's so much healing that can come, but not if  
**[0:42:13-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:42:13):**  I as a white person coming in as a savior, as a missionary, right?  
**[0:42:17-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:42:17):**  With my mission based business.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:42:19):**  Now we found a solution.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:42:20):**  Everybody listened.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:42:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:42:22):**  So that's not going to work.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:42:23):**  And I think there's a lot of really good learning to happen for everybody.

**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:42:30):**  Instagram is the best place to find them.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:42:31):**  I have to say it's fascinating.

**[0:46:11-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:46:11):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:46:13):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what

**[0:46:27-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:46:27):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:46:29):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.

**[0:46:35-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/24/ethan-soloviev-2#t=0:46:35):**  It's also not investment advice.

**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:00:44):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:00:50):**  Mind my focus on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:00:55):**  have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat.

**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:01:04):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:01:34):**  Welcome to a check in interview with Geert van der Veer, co-founder of Heerenboel.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:01:38):**  We recorded the first episode of the podcast in September 2017 when he had one community  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:01:43):**  owned farm operating in the Netherlands with the audacious goal of opening a thousand community  
**[0:01:48-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:01:48):**  owned farms throughout Europe.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:01:50):**  I'm very eager to check in with him two years after and how things are going.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:01:54):**  Welcome back, Geert.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:01:55):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:01:56):**  Hi Koen.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:01:57):**  So we are in September 2019, two years after we recorded and released the first podcast  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:02):**  we did together.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:03):**  I would love to hear, I mean, I know more than a billion things have happened, but could  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:07):**  you give a very short summary of where you are right now with Heerenboel?  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:11):**  Okay.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:12):**  Let's do it very short, but I don't know whether it will work.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:16):**  Don't worry.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:17):**  I have a lot of questions.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:18):**  Let's go.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:20):**  I believe last time we had one farm open in the Netherlands in Boxdol.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:26):**  At the moment we're working on over 20 projects all over the country from Rotterdam, Haarlem,  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:34):**  Utrecht, Weert, all over the country from south to north, from east to west.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:40):**  Up and running are this moment as we speak two farms, but would we have this podcast  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:44):**  recorded about three months later, we would have, I believe, four, five or six farms because  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:51):**  we're running up to deadlines for opening four new farms at the moment.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:56):**  So next season we will have five or six farms up and running.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:00):**  So that's just for the concept of the farm.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:04):**  But in addition, we have been working on our sole fund.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:08):**  The idea is that investors can buy in and the fund will buy land, which will keep it  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:14):**  for eternity in the fund.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:16):**  And yes, we have finished the construction.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:19):**  We have already managed to buy land in Weert, the city of Weert in the province of Limburg,  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:25):**  where we can offer a 2.4% return on investment to the investor.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:32):**  And so this farm is also going to be open this year.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:36):**  So I think that are the two major steps, but let me also brief you shortly on this.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:42):**  Let me inform you on this.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:45):**  We have been, the concept is going globally.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:50):**  Like there is a dimension from China.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:52):**  We have been in China daily.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:54):**  We have been in America, in Africa, countries all over Europe.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:59):**  And there is a lot of interest in what we do.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:02):**  We try to manage that as good as possible.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:06):**  What we see right now is that we have a person in France who wants to copy, who wants to  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:12):**  bring Heerenboel to France.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:13):**  So that's, I think, a very serious one.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:16):**  Sweden is one and German, but we'll keep it off as long as possible so we can concentrate  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:24):**  on improving our concept and doing new things in the Netherlands at the moment.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:29):**  But yes, we can go abroad as well.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:32):**  So I think that is status quo at this moment, I think.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:38):**  Extremely exciting.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:39):**  Thank you so much to unpack there, just to give a very brief, I will definitely link  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:43):**  the earlier interview obviously below where we discussed the concept in great detail,  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:46):**  but it's a group of families, about 150 to 200 that buys a farm and hires a farmer to  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:52):**  operate it.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:53):**  So it's not the families that have to do the farming.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:55):**  It's really a farmer that has then a stable income and is producing as regeneratively  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:00):**  as possible.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:02):**  I think it's about 60, 70% of the daily needs of those families when the farm is fully operating  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:06):**  and et cetera.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:07):**  So has that concept changed a lot in the last two years or is it still very much the same?  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:12):**  It's still very much the same, but what we see as we have been concentrating on the regenerative  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:18):**  aspect of producing, what we have experienced in the last four years is that it's not just  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:23):**  the way we produce, which is important, it's also the community.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:27):**  We saw that already in the design of the farm in 2012, but it's very manifest at this moment  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:33):**  that see that there is a lot of spin-off on the social side of our farm.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:38):**  So people who are lonely or something, they get back in a new community, find new friends,  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:44):**  find new contacts, getting a total new social life.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:48):**  We also see that in the community and with the farm in Vauxhall, for example, we are  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:54):**  receiving, we are welcoming multiple disabled people at this moment who can come to the  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:00):**  farm for one morning in the week to have an experience they cannot have when they stay  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:05):**  inside, et cetera.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:07):**  So we are also on that kind of social aspects working.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:11):**  And what also is very special is that the Koning Willem Eem College in Zegdorff-Bosch  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:17):**  is a school to learn how to cook.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:21):**  They became a member of the Co-op Tiffen Vauxhall.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:23):**  So you see that all kinds of social aspects are also happening.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:26):**  And I think that is something in addition to the concept as we discussed it in the earlier  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:31):**  podcast.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:32):**  So a lot of additional spin-off when you look at the impact beyond the environment and obviously  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:39):**  the fact that people eat much better food.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:41):**  Of course.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:42):**  What I really found extremely interesting, I mean, when we met the first time, but also  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:46):**  when we recorded the podcast, is how you tap into and utilize in a good way and facilitate  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:51):**  local energy.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:52):**  Because all the farms are only started when there is a strong local community that does  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:57):**  most of the earlier work and does most of the actually the fundraising and the structure,  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:02):**  et cetera.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:03):**  And you assist in that.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:04):**  It's not that you open the farms.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:06):**  How has that been going?  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:07):**  Would you have a lot of them starting basically the next weeks, the next months until the  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:11):**  end of the year and probably a lot of them in progress as well?  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:14):**  How are you managing all these super energetic local communities that probably want to start  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:18):**  yesterday and not tomorrow?  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:21):**  This is the core of what we do because if we do not do that and it would be our goal  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:26):**  to open the farm, there is a different energy within the corporation.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:30):**  We want it.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:31):**  We put extremely much energy.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:32):**  Just to be clear, you mean the cooperative.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:34):**  Sorry.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:35):**  To be very clear on terminology.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:40):**  So because the energy would be different when we want to have a specific place or when it's  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:46):**  really by the members.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:49):**  So that's the most of the energy is going to facilitate groups of people who want to  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:55):**  do this.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:56):**  So what we did, we standardized a process, which is never the process because it always  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:01):**  differs from place to place, but it helps us to have a storyline to guide these people  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:07):**  with towards their farm.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:10):**  And at the moment we have standardized it, it was, we were able to manage expectations.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:16):**  Everyone wants to start his farm tomorrow, but you have to have the soil, but more important,  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:21):**  you have to have at least 135 until 150 people households to join before you can start.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:28):**  And that's the reason that we do that to keep loans from banks, et cetera, outside.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:33):**  We want to do it pure on the money people bring.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:36):**  And when we discuss this process at the beginning of, at the start of an end of an initiative,  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:42):**  we can manage the expectations very well.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:45):**  And what we have right now is a team of nine people working almost on a daily base, just  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:51):**  on supporting these groups of people.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:54):**  And for these people who are locally working on their own farm, they of course are occupied  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:03):**  during the day.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:04):**  So what our team does is spending a lot of times with these people in the evenings and  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:10):**  in the weekends.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:11):**  So the effort we have to put is enormous, but on the other hand, what you see right  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:16):**  now is that communities are finding each other.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:19):**  So we put a lot of effort upfront and right now there is a kind of spinoff that communities  
**[0:09:24-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:24):**  are helping each other.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:26):**  They are visiting each other.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:27):**  How far are you?  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:28):**  What are your experiences, et cetera.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:31):**  And in addition to that, to the process, we organize every three months meeting with all  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:38):**  the board members of the local initiative.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:41):**  So we actively stimulate exchange of experience and knowledge.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:47):**  And that helps a lot.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:48):**  That helps a lot.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:49):**  But in the core business at this moment for our team is communication, providing services,  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:55):**  getting all the legislation done, the local community, municipal, et cetera.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:00):**  So a lot to do.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:03):**  And I think that is also the reason that you're trying to hold off a bit from expansion,  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:07):**  let's say, throughout Europe, because the circumstances change a lot and managing energy  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:12):**  and expectation in France is very different than it is maybe in the Netherlands.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:16):**  How would you bring it to other places?  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:18):**  I mean, it's already being pulled out of you basically.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:20):**  Like I want to start this in France.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:21):**  I want to start this in Sweden.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:22):**  How are you going to manage to make sure that they're going to be a success?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:27):**  Okay.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:28):**  Yeah, that's one of my main concerns.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:29):**  But we also have a little start for the answer because yes, we want this to happen in other  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:34):**  countries in Europe.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:35):**  The goal is still the same as it was two years ago.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:38):**  And we thought, okay, when we in the Netherlands are floating on local energy, why would we  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:44):**  have control in how processes would go in other countries?  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:50):**  So we want to have other people in other countries to bring the flow.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:55):**  So we have as much as responsibility with people who really want to bring it to the  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:59):**  country.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:00):**  I don't want to have farm in the country, but I want to scale up the Netherlands to  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:06):**  France.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:07):**  So we found a couple of people and what we're doing right now is we're negotiating on just  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:12):**  a few principles.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:14):**  Like when you work with these principles, like it is a community based principle.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:22):**  It's a nature inclusive farming, regenerative farming.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:26):**  It is you're not allowed to sell to open markets because that brings another sentence in like  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:33):**  we could sell, we could make profit.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:35):**  No, it's not profit, it's for the best food.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:37):**  And now we are at this moment, we are formulating a few of these principles.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:43):**  Our belief is that we, when some people in France, for example, want to bring the farm  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:49):**  concept to France, when they agree on these principles and we have a lot of contact in  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:54):**  sharing experiences, we don't even think we have to be in France, but we can inform each  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:00):**  other in modern ways.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:01):**  So people in France should do it in France.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:04):**  They should translate our concept into the France context.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:08):**  And when they stick to the principles, I think we have a new initiative born in another European  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:14):**  country.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:15):**  I think that makes a lot of sense because you will never be able with these principles  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:20):**  to manage 20 countries or I mean, there are just no way you probably wanted and in a way  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:26):**  I think that that would go well if you look at the social side, the cooperative side and  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:32):**  also the ecosystem side.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:34):**  But imagine that you have to do that.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:38):**  You should know every cultural aspects.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:40):**  Yeah, it's impossible.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:41):**  It's impossible.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:42):**  So what we are looking for are people who want to bring the concept to a certain country.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:48):**  We are going to agree on a few principles.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:51):**  This is how you have to stick to and please fill it in locally and nationally the way  
**[0:12:58-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:58):**  it can fit and that the situation in the Netherlands is totally different with this amount of people  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:05):**  on this little area.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:08):**  It's totally different from other countries.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:10):**  We have a flat country, not mountains.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:13):**  We don't have the problems that you face at that moment.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:17):**  There are so many different aspects that local people should do that, not us.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:23):**  So we think this is the way we are going to do it.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:26):**  And in terms of the farming part of things, you have one older farm operating already  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:31):**  for a while.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:32):**  I would love to hear how that is going because there were some very challenging summers actually  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:36):**  in the Netherlands with huge droughts and too much rain, etc.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:40):**  Of course, very, very warm if you look at climate change.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:43):**  And then how are you doing things differently with the designing and because you learn probably  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:48):**  a lot from that first farm in the new farms that are operating now or opening now.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:53):**  So how is the farming going?  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:55):**  Yeah, well, the beauty of the design is that there are so many different products that  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:00):**  when one specific kind of vegetable, for example, is failing, there is no harvest.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:06):**  There is always another piece you can offer your members.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:10):**  But I actually am producing too much.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:13):**  That's on one hand.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:15):**  So yes, there was a lot of drought.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:17):**  Luckily, we have water, at least in Boxtel and in the farm in Loon, also opened up in  
**[0:14:23-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:23):**  Apeldoorn, is also able to pump up the water from the ground from deeper layers.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:31):**  We gained a license for that.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:32):**  And that's the way we...  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:34):**  Drought is not the problem.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:35):**  The actual problem is the amount of UV light during the day, because that burns really  
**[0:14:42-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:42):**  not a lot, but especially certain vegetables are more sensitive for that than others.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:49):**  And yes, so there are failures in the yield.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:53):**  Yes.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:54):**  And we learned from that.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:55):**  And one thing we learned, for example, looking at lettuce, for example, we were trying to  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:01):**  keep the herbs around the lettuce away.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:04):**  We were constantly shuffling, etc.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:08):**  And there was this insight a couple of years ago that we thought, hey, we are on a sandy  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:13):**  soil, we are taking away all the herbs to have just the lettuce growing in the soil.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:19):**  And then what happens is that the sandy soil with the little blow of wind is also losing  
**[0:15:25-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:25):**  it.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:26):**  So we should keep it there.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:27):**  So is there a possibility to have other products growing underneath the lettuce?  
**[0:15:32-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:32):**  And before we start thinking of an edible plant or something, we started not taking  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:39):**  away herbs.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:41):**  Beneficial herbs or weeds or what we consider...  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:43):**  Weeds.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:44):**  Weeds is a very sensitive discussion because some people say there are no weeds.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:48):**  Some others are obviously very, very against weeds.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:51):**  And so it depends on the complex.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:53):**  But anything, something you considered you didn't want, like you previous...  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:58):**  Exactly.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:59):**  Let's name them weeds for...  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:03):**  But what we did is we didn't remove them anymore.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:06):**  And we saw that the microclimate around the lettuce was improving because lettuce doesn't  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:11):**  need that much sun as they would have in the way we did before.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:17):**  And we see that the lettuce is growing very, very, very nice within the weeds, in between  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:23):**  the weeds.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:24):**  And we are discovering how can we produce in cooperation with weeds, et cetera, instead  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:31):**  of having a lot of labor removing it.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:34):**  And that helps a lot.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:36):**  Microclimate thinking around product helps us a lot to understand what its needs are,  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:41):**  but also how to become more driven by nature.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:46):**  So we are two things.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:50):**  We are at this moment still able to bring water to the vegetables, for example, but  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:55):**  we are also preparing for a long term situation, what if not.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:59):**  So one of the goals is that we could keep as much water on the farm as possible, water  
**[0:17:04-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:04):**  from rain, et cetera.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:05):**  We want to buffer it so we can use it for later moments when there is less.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:11):**  And the other hand, learning about microclimates around vegetables and the role weeds can play.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:18):**  And two things I remember, it was very difficult to find farmers that are able to manage all  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:23):**  these different circumstances, that are able to manage animals regeneratively and holistically,  
**[0:17:27-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:27):**  that are able to manage microclimates of lettuce.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:30):**  How has that been going on?  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:32):**  Because you need a lot of them if you have six or seven farms operating at the end of  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:36):**  the year.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:37):**  Yeah, we about total last year, so about a year ago, we started our own course.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:43):**  So we developed together with the University of Applied Science here in the Netherlands,  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:50):**  we developed a course and this course is up and running right now.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:53):**  So we have a third group, just 10 farmers as a pilot.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:57):**  So they're almost for a year with us.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:01):**  And next October, maybe November, the next group will start.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:04):**  So we see little by little, it's hard to find the best farmers for this concept.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:11):**  It's hard to find them, but when we find them, we have to train them.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:14):**  That's the reason this course is being developed.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:17):**  It's little by little, we can discover.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:20):**  You're training your own farmers.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:22):**  And how has it gone with animals on the farm?  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:24):**  I remember you being very deliberate about certain types of animals that had to be able  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:28):**  to do most of the things themselves and the role within this 20 hectare farm.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:33):**  How has it been so far?  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:35):**  Well, actually, because there is so much to do in the farm, the development of the real  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:39):**  integration of the animal as a co-worker on the farm is going little by little.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:44):**  But yes, it looks like our chickens are really good helpers right now in the orchards, but  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:51):**  it also brings some challenges.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:53):**  We have the fox still around the farm.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:55):**  And of course, when the chickens are outside, it's really easy to get your evening dinner  
**[0:19:01-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:01):**  has a fox.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:02):**  So we are looking for other animals to support us in defending our chickens from the fox.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:10):**  And what we did, what we have done right now is for example, introduce boosters.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:15):**  Is that the right word?  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:17):**  Yeah, they're used as a guardian, guardian animals, not dogs, obviously, guardian animals  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:23):**  on farms.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:24):**  Exactly.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:25):**  So what we did, we introduced them in our system and it seems helpful and seems to work.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:30):**  So what we do is constantly thinking of what can we add to our system, also add as animals  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:36):**  into our system to help the problems we are facing.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:42):**  And this is a beautiful example.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:45):**  We also started developing what we call our Excalibur.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:51):**  We are going to leave the system of a vast, stable place on the farm with a big colony.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:58):**  We are really bringing them around with the big caravan.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:02):**  So moving from a chicken caravan that obviously many people in the region egg space have to  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:06):**  a pig caravan.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:07):**  Exactly.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:08):**  It will be a good thing for you to see.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:10):**  And we're building, we're having this group of people who are designing it.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:15):**  And what is the big caravan needed for?  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:18):**  Well, actually, you do not want your, you want to offer a kind of shelter, not really  
**[0:20:23-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:23):**  necessary because they can also live outside.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:26):**  But okay, we want to offer some shelter.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:28):**  And on the other hand, we have this delivery room need, you know, where can they bring  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:34):**  little pigs and we think when we can do that within the caravan, there is a possibility  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:41):**  for our members to also see how that works, you know, so they can see the little pigs  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:47):**  and the mama, et cetera.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:48):**  We want to do that in the caravan.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:49):**  In addition to the caravan, we have this mobile fence to keep the pigs within a certain area  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:56):**  of the farm so that they are not running over the fresh vegetables who needs to be harvested.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:02):**  So this caravan helps us by controlling where the pigs are, but not too much because they  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:08):**  have to live their own life on their own.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:10):**  That's another aspect.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:12):**  So we see that we are constantly thinking and developing and we also find some inspiration  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:19):**  all over the world watching YouTube or other media, social media as well to be informed  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:25):**  how other farmers in the world are dealing with it.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:29):**  So it's not just us inventing stuff.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:32):**  We're also translating what we see into our content.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:35):**  And let's spend the last few minutes of this podcast because I know you have a hard stop  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:38):**  and I want to be conscious of your time on the soil fund.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:42):**  So you mentioned that briefly at the beginning, but let's dive into that a bit deeper.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:46):**  You've been working on that.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:48):**  One of the key aspects of the Heerenburen is that the land is either bought or secured  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:53):**  for a very long time, but if it's bought, it's never going to be sold.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:56):**  So the business model of a traditional farm in many cases, unfortunately, is selling their  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:01):**  land at some point and hopefully for more than they bought it, then maybe that's their  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:04):**  pension, et cetera.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:05):**  But it's created a huge amount of issues in terms of inflated land prices and mainly for  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:10):**  young farmers, extremely difficult to get into the space.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:14):**  You are going into a completely different direction, but at the same time, you still  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:17):**  need land obviously to a long-term land because you're building the soil to operate Heerenburen  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:22):**  farms on.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:23):**  So can you explain a bit about the rationale behind the soil fund and how it's actually  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:27):**  coming to life now?  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:29):**  Sure.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:30):**  Let me remark this to begin with.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:33):**  There is a difference between ownership of land and access to land.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:38):**  We are really thinking from the access strategy, how can we access land and how can we improve  
**[0:22:47-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:47):**  that land for in a way the seventh generation after us still can work on the land and have  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:54):**  food from the land.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:55):**  And yes, speculation here in the Netherlands at least brings the ownership of land, the  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:01):**  consequences that there is really short-term access for particular farmers to land because  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:06):**  it helps the owner of the land to make short-term arrangements, short-term arrangements.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:13):**  So after every arrangement, you can come up with a new arrangement with a higher price.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:19):**  Every time you skip, you can increase the price.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:22):**  So there's a skill also for us, but also for what you just mentioned, farmers trying to  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:28):**  continue to farm.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:30):**  So access to land is something else than ownership of land.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:35):**  Ownership of land brings strong incentives.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:38):**  That's what we think.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:40):**  So this aspect of access, one way or another, you have to be able to have land and provide  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:49):**  access.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:50):**  When you have land, how do you get it?  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:52):**  You have to buy it.  
**[0:23:53-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:53):**  So we were thinking of this fund, which would be able to buy land and never resell it again.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:02):**  We started first with our own initiative, but in the end, we found a partner in the  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:07):**  Netherlands who exists for already 40 years.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:11):**  It is a foundation called over here, but they are 40 years providing the biodynamic farmers  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:20):**  with soil and their goal is to never sell it again.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:23):**  Okay, so there is a partner already existing.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:26):**  The big changes that they had to make was that we as Eerboer are not specific biodynamic  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:33):**  farmers, could be, but not specific.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:37):**  Organic is what we do and in addition, we try to do regenerative.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:42):**  So we are not biodynamic.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:44):**  So they had to make this choice, are we going to work with Eerboer Netherlands as a partner?  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:51):**  Because then we have to make a choice to not be biodynamic specifically anymore.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:56):**  And they made that choice.  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:57):**  They were able to make that choice.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:58):**  So at this moment we have a partner and we have been inviting wealthy families, family  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:25:07):**  funds, et cetera, to invest in the fund.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:25:11):**  And yes, we have made our first deal.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:25:15):**  So there is a family investing in the fund.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:25:17):**  We have bought land, land from a farm in Weert, province of Limburg.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:25:23):**  And the first 12 hectares have been bought, a little farmhouse is still on there.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:25:28):**  It's also bought.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:25:29):**  And so the community in Weert is hiring the land from this foundation.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:25:36):**  And we also have a role at Eerboer Netherlands to keep the continuity of the farming.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:25:42):**  So we have made this triangle agreement and we can work together with it.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:25:47):**  So the investor does receive between 1.5 and 2.4% interest.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:25:54):**  So it's quite different because the soil is secured under the investment.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:01):**  And we can provide land forever to the best farmer at the moment.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:06):**  And of course, we're looking at our own farms.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:11):**  So actually, after a year, one and a half negotiations, searching trial and error, this  
**[0:26:18-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:18):**  partner was the best option and the most simple way to fill in our needs and wishes.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:26):**  And did they set up a separate fund for you?  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:30):**  Are they managing that or is it in their normal portfolio?  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:34):**  It's incorporated in the real business.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:36):**  It's incorporated in the normal portfolio.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:39):**  And the investor invests specifically in a specific piece of land or invests in the overall  
**[0:26:44-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:44):**  portfolio?  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:45):**  Well, at this moment, you can choose both.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:48):**  The beauty of Weert is that we found an investor especially for that piece of soil.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:52):**  It's beautiful that we can connect people really to the soil.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:56):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:26:57-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:57):**  That piece of soil.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:58):**  But yeah, it's also possible to invest just on principle and to know that there is soil,  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:05):**  that soil will be bought somewhere with the right treatment.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:09):**  And would it be accessible for the local communities as well as they are obviously investing, I  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:15):**  think it was 2000 euros per household to set up the farm, but not to buy it.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:20):**  What's the minimum?  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:21):**  Would they be also invited to not only help fund the setup of the farm, but also actually  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:25):**  to buy the land of their farm?  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:28):**  Yeah, that's exactly the topic we're working on right now.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:32):**  This is the next thing to develop.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:33):**  We really want to invite them to invest and not only the members of the farm, but also  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:40):**  the people around the farm, not necessarily being a member of the farm.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:44):**  So we want to work on this dialogue between neighbors and farmers.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:50):**  Like okay, when I own the land, we can negotiate on how our land is treated.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:55):**  So farmer, we think these are important topics like biodiversity, etc.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:02):**  So the concept we're working on is that households can invest in the ownership of soil, the rights  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:10):**  resting on the soil, the ownership is still in the fund, but they have the rights to set  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:16):**  up, to choose the farmer, to choose the concept, etc.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:20):**  So it's not necessarily just the members of the farm, and we're working on that.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:24):**  And of course we want to have as much as here at Woolfarms on community owned land.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:30):**  Yeah, I think it's one of those missing pieces and one of the things that's hardly ever discussed.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:34):**  I think it's an extremely time consuming and difficult topic, ownership of land, but something  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:39):**  we have to work on, we have to look at if we want this movement to succeed just as community  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:44):**  ownership of farms, which might be a bit faster than land.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:47):**  But yeah, the land ownership topic is one of those elephants in the room that keeps  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:51):**  coming back.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:52):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:53):**  We are referring to that.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:54):**  We come and we run.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:57):**  Which is a huge topic.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:58):**  I want to be conscious of your time here.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:00):**  I know you have to go.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:01):**  I want to thank you so much for this checking interview two years after.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:04):**  I promise not to make it another two years before we're checking in again, because I  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:07):**  think it seems like everything is speeding up now, which means that in a couple of months  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:11):**  or in a year, there will be for sure more than half an hour of updates to share.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:15):**  But thank you for your time this morning.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:17):**  And actually something to mention, the King of the Netherlands will visit your farm or  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:21):**  the first farm you operate opened next week.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:24):**  So by the time this is out, we might be able to share some pictures of that for all the  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:28):**  Dutch people, because anybody outside, I don't think really cares.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:31):**  But it's quite a big moment in the Netherlands, I can assure you.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:35):**  So congratulations with that.

**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:30:50):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:30:54):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:30:59):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:32:01):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:32:06):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.

**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:32:16):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.

**[0:32:20-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:32:20):**  So what is this course?

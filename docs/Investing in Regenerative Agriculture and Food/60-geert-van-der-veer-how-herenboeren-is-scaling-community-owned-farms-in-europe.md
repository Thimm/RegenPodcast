**[0:00:13-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:00:13):**  You're listening to the second interview with Geert of Heerenboem, who we talked to  two years ago.  We discuss his recent soil investment fund and how to channel all that energy of local  
**[0:00:23-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:00:23):**  communities that want to start their own farm yesterday and not wait until tomorrow.  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:39-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:00:39):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Mind my focus on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:55-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:00:55):**  have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:01:09):**  In March last year, we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support  our work.  And so many of you have joined as a member.

**[0:01:38-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:01:38):**  We recorded the first episode of the podcast in September 2017 when he had one community  owned farm operating in the Netherlands with the audacious goal of opening a thousand community  owned farms throughout Europe.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:01:50):**  I'm very eager to check in with him two years after and how things are going.  Welcome back, Geert.  Thank you.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:01:56):**  Hi Koen.  So we are in September 2019, two years after we recorded and released the first podcast  we did together.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:03):**  I would love to hear, I mean, I know more than a billion things have happened, but could  you give a very short summary of where you are right now with Heerenboel?  Okay.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:12):**  Let's do it very short, but I don't know whether it will work.  Don't worry.  I have a lot of questions.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:18):**  Let's go.  I believe last time we had one farm open in the Netherlands in Boxdol.  At the moment we're working on over 20 projects all over the country from Rotterdam, Haarlem,  
**[0:02:34-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:34):**  Utrecht, Weert, all over the country from south to north, from east to west.  Up and running are this moment as we speak two farms, but would we have this podcast  recorded about three months later, we would have, I believe, four, five or six farms because  
**[0:02:51-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:02:51):**  we're running up to deadlines for opening four new farms at the moment.  So next season we will have five or six farms up and running.  So that's just for the concept of the farm.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:04):**  But in addition, we have been working on our sole fund.  The idea is that investors can buy in and the fund will buy land, which will keep it  for eternity in the fund.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:16):**  And yes, we have finished the construction.  We have already managed to buy land in Weert, the city of Weert in the province of Limburg,  where we can offer a 2.4% return on investment to the investor.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:32):**  And so this farm is also going to be open this year.  So I think that are the two major steps, but let me also brief you shortly on this.  Let me inform you on this.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:45):**  We have been, the concept is going globally.  Like there is a dimension from China.  We have been in China daily.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:03:54):**  We have been in America, in Africa, countries all over Europe.  And there is a lot of interest in what we do.  We try to manage that as good as possible.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:06):**  What we see right now is that we have a person in France who wants to copy, who wants to  bring Heerenboel to France.  So that's, I think, a very serious one.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:16):**  Sweden is one and German, but we'll keep it off as long as possible so we can concentrate  on improving our concept and doing new things in the Netherlands at the moment.  But yes, we can go abroad as well.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:32):**  So I think that is status quo at this moment, I think.  Extremely exciting.  Thank you so much to unpack there, just to give a very brief, I will definitely link  
**[0:04:43-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:43):**  the earlier interview obviously below where we discussed the concept in great detail,  but it's a group of families, about 150 to 200 that buys a farm and hires a farmer to  operate it.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:04:53):**  So it's not the families that have to do the farming.  It's really a farmer that has then a stable income and is producing as regeneratively  as possible.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:02):**  I think it's about 60, 70% of the daily needs of those families when the farm is fully operating  and et cetera.  So has that concept changed a lot in the last two years or is it still very much the same?  
**[0:05:12-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:12):**  It's still very much the same, but what we see as we have been concentrating on the regenerative  aspect of producing, what we have experienced in the last four years is that it's not just  the way we produce, which is important, it's also the community.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:27):**  We saw that already in the design of the farm in 2012, but it's very manifest at this moment  that see that there is a lot of spin-off on the social side of our farm.  So people who are lonely or something, they get back in a new community, find new friends,  
**[0:05:44-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:05:44):**  find new contacts, getting a total new social life.  We also see that in the community and with the farm in Vauxhall, for example, we are  receiving, we are welcoming multiple disabled people at this moment who can come to the  
**[0:06:00-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:00):**  farm for one morning in the week to have an experience they cannot have when they stay  inside, et cetera.  So we are also on that kind of social aspects working.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:11):**  And what also is very special is that the Koning Willem Eem College in Zegdorff-Bosch  is a school to learn how to cook.  They became a member of the Co-op Tiffen Vauxhall.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:23):**  So you see that all kinds of social aspects are also happening.  And I think that is something in addition to the concept as we discussed it in the earlier  podcast.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:32):**  So a lot of additional spin-off when you look at the impact beyond the environment and obviously  the fact that people eat much better food.  Of course.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:42):**  What I really found extremely interesting, I mean, when we met the first time, but also  when we recorded the podcast, is how you tap into and utilize in a good way and facilitate  local energy.  
**[0:06:52-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:06:52):**  Because all the farms are only started when there is a strong local community that does  most of the earlier work and does most of the actually the fundraising and the structure,  et cetera.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:03):**  And you assist in that.  It's not that you open the farms.  How has that been going?  
**[0:07:07-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:07):**  Would you have a lot of them starting basically the next weeks, the next months until the  end of the year and probably a lot of them in progress as well?  How are you managing all these super energetic local communities that probably want to start  
**[0:07:18-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:18):**  yesterday and not tomorrow?  Yeah.  This is the core of what we do because if we do not do that and it would be our goal  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:26):**  to open the farm, there is a different energy within the corporation.  We want it.  We put extremely much energy.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:32):**  Just to be clear, you mean the cooperative.  Sorry.  To be very clear on terminology.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:40):**  So because the energy would be different when we want to have a specific place or when it's  really by the members.  So that's the most of the energy is going to facilitate groups of people who want to  
**[0:07:55-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:07:55):**  do this.  So what we did, we standardized a process, which is never the process because it always  differs from place to place, but it helps us to have a storyline to guide these people  
**[0:08:07-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:07):**  with towards their farm.  And at the moment we have standardized it, it was, we were able to manage expectations.  Everyone wants to start his farm tomorrow, but you have to have the soil, but more important,  
**[0:08:21-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:21):**  you have to have at least 135 until 150 people households to join before you can start.  And that's the reason that we do that to keep loans from banks, et cetera, outside.  We want to do it pure on the money people bring.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:36):**  And when we discuss this process at the beginning of, at the start of an end of an initiative,  we can manage the expectations very well.  And what we have right now is a team of nine people working almost on a daily base, just  
**[0:08:51-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:08:51):**  on supporting these groups of people.  And for these people who are locally working on their own farm, they of course are occupied  during the day.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:04):**  So what our team does is spending a lot of times with these people in the evenings and  in the weekends.  So the effort we have to put is enormous, but on the other hand, what you see right  
**[0:09:16-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:16):**  now is that communities are finding each other.  So we put a lot of effort upfront and right now there is a kind of spinoff that communities  are helping each other.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:26):**  They are visiting each other.  How far are you?  What are your experiences, et cetera.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:31):**  And in addition to that, to the process, we organize every three months meeting with all  the board members of the local initiative.  So we actively stimulate exchange of experience and knowledge.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:47):**  And that helps a lot.  That helps a lot.  But in the core business at this moment for our team is communication, providing services,  
**[0:09:55-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:09:55):**  getting all the legislation done, the local community, municipal, et cetera.  So a lot to do.  And I think that is also the reason that you're trying to hold off a bit from expansion,  
**[0:10:07-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:07):**  let's say, throughout Europe, because the circumstances change a lot and managing energy  and expectation in France is very different than it is maybe in the Netherlands.  How would you bring it to other places?  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:18):**  I mean, it's already being pulled out of you basically.  Like I want to start this in France.  I want to start this in Sweden.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:22):**  How are you going to manage to make sure that they're going to be a success?  Okay.  Yeah, that's one of my main concerns.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:29):**  But we also have a little start for the answer because yes, we want this to happen in other  countries in Europe.  The goal is still the same as it was two years ago.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:38):**  And we thought, okay, when we in the Netherlands are floating on local energy, why would we  have control in how processes would go in other countries?  So we want to have other people in other countries to bring the flow.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:10:55):**  So we have as much as responsibility with people who really want to bring it to the  country.  I don't want to have farm in the country, but I want to scale up the Netherlands to  
**[0:11:06-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:06):**  France.  So we found a couple of people and what we're doing right now is we're negotiating on just  a few principles.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:14):**  Like when you work with these principles, like it is a community based principle.  It's a nature inclusive farming, regenerative farming.  It is you're not allowed to sell to open markets because that brings another sentence in like  
**[0:11:33-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:33):**  we could sell, we could make profit.  No, it's not profit, it's for the best food.  And now we are at this moment, we are formulating a few of these principles.  
**[0:11:43-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:11:43):**  Our belief is that we, when some people in France, for example, want to bring the farm  concept to France, when they agree on these principles and we have a lot of contact in  sharing experiences, we don't even think we have to be in France, but we can inform each  
**[0:12:00-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:00):**  other in modern ways.  So people in France should do it in France.  They should translate our concept into the France context.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:08):**  And when they stick to the principles, I think we have a new initiative born in another European  country.  I think that makes a lot of sense because you will never be able with these principles  
**[0:12:20-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:20):**  to manage 20 countries or I mean, there are just no way you probably wanted and in a way  I think that that would go well if you look at the social side, the cooperative side and  also the ecosystem side.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:34):**  But imagine that you have to do that.  You should know every cultural aspects.  Yeah, it's impossible.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:41):**  It's impossible.  So what we are looking for are people who want to bring the concept to a certain country.  We are going to agree on a few principles.  
**[0:12:51-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:12:51):**  This is how you have to stick to and please fill it in locally and nationally the way  it can fit and that the situation in the Netherlands is totally different with this amount of people  on this little area.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:08):**  It's totally different from other countries.  We have a flat country, not mountains.  We don't have the problems that you face at that moment.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:17):**  There are so many different aspects that local people should do that, not us.  So we think this is the way we are going to do it.  And in terms of the farming part of things, you have one older farm operating already  
**[0:13:31-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:31):**  for a while.  I would love to hear how that is going because there were some very challenging summers actually  in the Netherlands with huge droughts and too much rain, etc.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:40):**  Of course, very, very warm if you look at climate change.  And then how are you doing things differently with the designing and because you learn probably  a lot from that first farm in the new farms that are operating now or opening now.  
**[0:13:53-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:13:53):**  So how is the farming going?  Yeah, well, the beauty of the design is that there are so many different products that  when one specific kind of vegetable, for example, is failing, there is no harvest.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:06):**  There is always another piece you can offer your members.  But I actually am producing too much.  That's on one hand.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:15):**  So yes, there was a lot of drought.  Luckily, we have water, at least in Boxtel and in the farm in Loon, also opened up in  Apeldoorn, is also able to pump up the water from the ground from deeper layers.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:31):**  We gained a license for that.  And that's the way we...  Drought is not the problem.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:35):**  The actual problem is the amount of UV light during the day, because that burns really  not a lot, but especially certain vegetables are more sensitive for that than others.  And yes, so there are failures in the yield.  
**[0:14:53-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:14:53):**  Yes.  And we learned from that.  And one thing we learned, for example, looking at lettuce, for example, we were trying to  
**[0:15:01-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:01):**  keep the herbs around the lettuce away.  We were constantly shuffling, etc.  And there was this insight a couple of years ago that we thought, hey, we are on a sandy  
**[0:15:13-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:13):**  soil, we are taking away all the herbs to have just the lettuce growing in the soil.  And then what happens is that the sandy soil with the little blow of wind is also losing  it.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:26):**  So we should keep it there.  So is there a possibility to have other products growing underneath the lettuce?  And before we start thinking of an edible plant or something, we started not taking  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:39):**  away herbs.  Beneficial herbs or weeds or what we consider...  Weeds.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:44):**  Weeds is a very sensitive discussion because some people say there are no weeds.  Some others are obviously very, very against weeds.  And so it depends on the complex.  
**[0:15:53-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:15:53):**  But anything, something you considered you didn't want, like you previous...  Exactly.  Let's name them weeds for...  
**[0:16:03-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:03):**  But what we did is we didn't remove them anymore.  And we saw that the microclimate around the lettuce was improving because lettuce doesn't  need that much sun as they would have in the way we did before.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:17):**  And we see that the lettuce is growing very, very, very nice within the weeds, in between  the weeds.  And we are discovering how can we produce in cooperation with weeds, et cetera, instead  
**[0:16:31-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:31):**  of having a lot of labor removing it.  And that helps a lot.  Microclimate thinking around product helps us a lot to understand what its needs are,  
**[0:16:41-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:41):**  but also how to become more driven by nature.  So we are two things.  We are at this moment still able to bring water to the vegetables, for example, but  
**[0:16:55-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:16:55):**  we are also preparing for a long term situation, what if not.  So one of the goals is that we could keep as much water on the farm as possible, water  from rain, et cetera.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:05):**  We want to buffer it so we can use it for later moments when there is less.  And the other hand, learning about microclimates around vegetables and the role weeds can play.  And two things I remember, it was very difficult to find farmers that are able to manage all  
**[0:17:23-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:23):**  these different circumstances, that are able to manage animals regeneratively and holistically,  that are able to manage microclimates of lettuce.  How has that been going on?  
**[0:17:32-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:32):**  Because you need a lot of them if you have six or seven farms operating at the end of  the year.  Yeah, we about total last year, so about a year ago, we started our own course.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:43):**  So we developed together with the University of Applied Science here in the Netherlands,  we developed a course and this course is up and running right now.  So we have a third group, just 10 farmers as a pilot.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:17:57):**  So they're almost for a year with us.  And next October, maybe November, the next group will start.  So we see little by little, it's hard to find the best farmers for this concept.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:11):**  It's hard to find them, but when we find them, we have to train them.  That's the reason this course is being developed.  It's little by little, we can discover.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:20):**  You're training your own farmers.  And how has it gone with animals on the farm?  I remember you being very deliberate about certain types of animals that had to be able  
**[0:18:28-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:28):**  to do most of the things themselves and the role within this 20 hectare farm.  How has it been so far?  Well, actually, because there is so much to do in the farm, the development of the real  
**[0:18:39-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:39):**  integration of the animal as a co-worker on the farm is going little by little.  But yes, it looks like our chickens are really good helpers right now in the orchards, but  it also brings some challenges.  
**[0:18:53-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:18:53):**  We have the fox still around the farm.  And of course, when the chickens are outside, it's really easy to get your evening dinner  has a fox.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:02):**  So we are looking for other animals to support us in defending our chickens from the fox.  And what we did, what we have done right now is for example, introduce boosters.  Is that the right word?  
**[0:19:17-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:17):**  Yeah, they're used as a guardian, guardian animals, not dogs, obviously, guardian animals  on farms.  Exactly.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:25):**  So what we did, we introduced them in our system and it seems helpful and seems to work.  So what we do is constantly thinking of what can we add to our system, also add as animals  into our system to help the problems we are facing.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:42):**  And this is a beautiful example.  We also started developing what we call our Excalibur.  We are going to leave the system of a vast, stable place on the farm with a big colony.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:19:58):**  We are really bringing them around with the big caravan.  So moving from a chicken caravan that obviously many people in the region egg space have to  a pig caravan.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:07):**  Exactly.  It will be a good thing for you to see.  And we're building, we're having this group of people who are designing it.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:15):**  And what is the big caravan needed for?  Well, actually, you do not want your, you want to offer a kind of shelter, not really  necessary because they can also live outside.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:26):**  But okay, we want to offer some shelter.  And on the other hand, we have this delivery room need, you know, where can they bring  little pigs and we think when we can do that within the caravan, there is a possibility  
**[0:20:41-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:41):**  for our members to also see how that works, you know, so they can see the little pigs  and the mama, et cetera.  We want to do that in the caravan.  
**[0:20:49-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:20:49):**  In addition to the caravan, we have this mobile fence to keep the pigs within a certain area  of the farm so that they are not running over the fresh vegetables who needs to be harvested.  So this caravan helps us by controlling where the pigs are, but not too much because they  
**[0:21:08-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:08):**  have to live their own life on their own.  That's another aspect.  So we see that we are constantly thinking and developing and we also find some inspiration  
**[0:21:19-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:19):**  all over the world watching YouTube or other media, social media as well to be informed  how other farmers in the world are dealing with it.  So it's not just us inventing stuff.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:32):**  We're also translating what we see into our content.  And let's spend the last few minutes of this podcast because I know you have a hard stop  and I want to be conscious of your time on the soil fund.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:42):**  So you mentioned that briefly at the beginning, but let's dive into that a bit deeper.  You've been working on that.  One of the key aspects of the Heerenburen is that the land is either bought or secured  
**[0:21:53-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:21:53):**  for a very long time, but if it's bought, it's never going to be sold.  So the business model of a traditional farm in many cases, unfortunately, is selling their  land at some point and hopefully for more than they bought it, then maybe that's their  
**[0:22:04-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:04):**  pension, et cetera.  But it's created a huge amount of issues in terms of inflated land prices and mainly for  young farmers, extremely difficult to get into the space.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:14):**  You are going into a completely different direction, but at the same time, you still  need land obviously to a long-term land because you're building the soil to operate Heerenburen  farms on.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:23):**  So can you explain a bit about the rationale behind the soil fund and how it's actually  coming to life now?  Sure.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:30):**  Let me remark this to begin with.  There is a difference between ownership of land and access to land.  We are really thinking from the access strategy, how can we access land and how can we improve  
**[0:22:47-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:22:47):**  that land for in a way the seventh generation after us still can work on the land and have  food from the land.  And yes, speculation here in the Netherlands at least brings the ownership of land, the  
**[0:23:01-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:01):**  consequences that there is really short-term access for particular farmers to land because  it helps the owner of the land to make short-term arrangements, short-term arrangements.  So after every arrangement, you can come up with a new arrangement with a higher price.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:19):**  Every time you skip, you can increase the price.  So there's a skill also for us, but also for what you just mentioned, farmers trying to  continue to farm.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:30):**  So access to land is something else than ownership of land.  Ownership of land brings strong incentives.  That's what we think.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:40):**  So this aspect of access, one way or another, you have to be able to have land and provide  access.  When you have land, how do you get it?  
**[0:23:52-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:23:52):**  You have to buy it.  So we were thinking of this fund, which would be able to buy land and never resell it again.  We started first with our own initiative, but in the end, we found a partner in the  
**[0:24:07-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:07):**  Netherlands who exists for already 40 years.  It is a foundation called over here, but they are 40 years providing the biodynamic farmers  with soil and their goal is to never sell it again.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:23):**  Okay, so there is a partner already existing.  The big changes that they had to make was that we as Eerboer are not specific biodynamic  farmers, could be, but not specific.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:37):**  Organic is what we do and in addition, we try to do regenerative.  So we are not biodynamic.  So they had to make this choice, are we going to work with Eerboer Netherlands as a partner?  
**[0:24:51-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:51):**  Because then we have to make a choice to not be biodynamic specifically anymore.  And they made that choice.  They were able to make that choice.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:24:58):**  So at this moment we have a partner and we have been inviting wealthy families, family  funds, et cetera, to invest in the fund.  And yes, we have made our first deal.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:25:15):**  So there is a family investing in the fund.  We have bought land, land from a farm in Weert, province of Limburg.  And the first 12 hectares have been bought, a little farmhouse is still on there.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:25:28):**  It's also bought.  And so the community in Weert is hiring the land from this foundation.  And we also have a role at Eerboer Netherlands to keep the continuity of the farming.  
**[0:25:42-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:25:42):**  So we have made this triangle agreement and we can work together with it.  So the investor does receive between 1.5 and 2.4% interest.  So it's quite different because the soil is secured under the investment.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:01):**  And we can provide land forever to the best farmer at the moment.  And of course, we're looking at our own farms.  So actually, after a year, one and a half negotiations, searching trial and error, this  
**[0:26:18-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:18):**  partner was the best option and the most simple way to fill in our needs and wishes.  And did they set up a separate fund for you?  Are they managing that or is it in their normal portfolio?  
**[0:26:34-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:34):**  It's incorporated in the real business.  It's incorporated in the normal portfolio.  And the investor invests specifically in a specific piece of land or invests in the overall  
**[0:26:44-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:44):**  portfolio?  Well, at this moment, you can choose both.  The beauty of Weert is that we found an investor especially for that piece of soil.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:52):**  It's beautiful that we can connect people really to the soil.  Yeah, of course.  That piece of soil.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:26:58):**  But yeah, it's also possible to invest just on principle and to know that there is soil,  that soil will be bought somewhere with the right treatment.  And would it be accessible for the local communities as well as they are obviously investing, I  
**[0:27:15-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:15):**  think it was 2000 euros per household to set up the farm, but not to buy it.  What's the minimum?  Would they be also invited to not only help fund the setup of the farm, but also actually  
**[0:27:25-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:25):**  to buy the land of their farm?  Yeah, that's exactly the topic we're working on right now.  This is the next thing to develop.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:33):**  We really want to invite them to invest and not only the members of the farm, but also  the people around the farm, not necessarily being a member of the farm.  So we want to work on this dialogue between neighbors and farmers.  
**[0:27:50-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:27:50):**  Like okay, when I own the land, we can negotiate on how our land is treated.  So farmer, we think these are important topics like biodiversity, etc.  So the concept we're working on is that households can invest in the ownership of soil, the rights  
**[0:28:10-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:10):**  resting on the soil, the ownership is still in the fund, but they have the rights to set  up, to choose the farmer, to choose the concept, etc.  So it's not necessarily just the members of the farm, and we're working on that.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:24):**  And of course we want to have as much as here at Woolfarms on community owned land.  Yeah, I think it's one of those missing pieces and one of the things that's hardly ever discussed.  I think it's an extremely time consuming and difficult topic, ownership of land, but something  
**[0:28:39-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:39):**  we have to work on, we have to look at if we want this movement to succeed just as community  ownership of farms, which might be a bit faster than land.  But yeah, the land ownership topic is one of those elephants in the room that keeps  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:51):**  coming back.  Yeah, exactly.  We are referring to that.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:28:54):**  We come and we run.  Which is a huge topic.  I want to be conscious of your time here.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:00):**  I know you have to go.  I want to thank you so much for this checking interview two years after.  I promise not to make it another two years before we're checking in again, because I  
**[0:29:07-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:07):**  think it seems like everything is speeding up now, which means that in a couple of months  or in a year, there will be for sure more than half an hour of updates to share.  But thank you for your time this morning.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:17):**  And actually something to mention, the King of the Netherlands will visit your farm or  the first farm you operate opened next week.  So by the time this is out, we might be able to share some pictures of that for all the  
**[0:29:28-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:28):**  Dutch people, because anybody outside, I don't think really cares.  But it's quite a big moment in the Netherlands, I can assure you.  So congratulations with that.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:29:36):**  Thank you.  Thank you.  I hope you enjoyed this interview with Geert and learned something about their soil investment

**[0:30:54-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:30:54):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:31:06-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:31:06):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?

**[0:31:32-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:31:32):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:31:44):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:31:57):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.

So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:32:16):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:32:21-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:32:21):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:32:34-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:32:34):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in and what kind of co investors you could find or what kind of investors you could  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:32:46):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:32:59):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/09/29/geert-van-der-veer-2/#t=0:33:05):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.

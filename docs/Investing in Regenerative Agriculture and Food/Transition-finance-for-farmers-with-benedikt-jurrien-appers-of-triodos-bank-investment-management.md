**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:00):**  In this interview, we will learn how one of the most sustainable banks in the world, Triodos,  
**[0:00:04-0:00:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:04):**  approaches financing transitions in energy and food, and what the role of banks can be  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:09):**  now and will be in the future when it comes to financing farmers who want to go beyond  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:14):**  sustainable towards regeneration.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:30):**  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:34):**  Why are we recording this series?  
**[0:00:36-0:00:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:36):**  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:39):**  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the gurus on their  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:44):**  farms, explored farm-size regenerative designs, and most importantly started their pilots  
**[0:00:49-0:00:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:49):**  and feedback loops.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:50):**  This is where transition finance is key.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:53):**  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of flexibility,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:58):**  and the farmers' lack of collateral.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:00):**  Furthermore, there's a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give  
**[0:01:05-0:01:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:05):**  away.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:06):**  That is why my co-host, aspiring-to-be regenerative farmer, Benedikt BÃ¶sel, and I are embarking  
**[0:01:11-0:01:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:11):**  on a journey to find out what are the key principles of transition finance for regenerative  
**[0:01:17-0:01:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:17):**  farmers.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:18):**  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative agriculture and food finance  
**[0:01:23-0:01:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:23):**  space.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:24):**  They share their insights, how they would finance the speed-up of the regenerative transition  
**[0:01:28-0:01:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:28):**  on Benedikt's 1,000 hectares, which is almost 2,500 acres, farm in Germany close to Berlin.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:35):**  This is an open process.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:36):**  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:40):**  We don't have the answers yet.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:41):**  That's a lot of questions.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:43):**  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other inspiration, people

**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:07):**  Yes, happy to be here.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:10):**  And a very warm welcome to our first guest we ever have on this series, which is Jurijan  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:15):**  Appers, fund manager of Triodos Organic Growth Fund, which is part of Triodos Investment  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:20):**  Management.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:21):**  And he also spent quite a bit of time at Triodos Bank.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:24):**  Welcome Jurijan.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:26):**  Hi, Koen.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:27):**  Happy to be here.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:28):**  Hi, Benedikt.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:29):**  Hi, there.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:30):**  So I always like to ask a personal question and to briefly introduce you, yourself basically,  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:36):**  and why you're so focused on food and agriculture.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:40):**  Well, first of all, thank you for having me on your podcast and on the series.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:45):**  And it's a pleasure being the first in this series.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:49):**  And a bit of my background, I've been working at Triodos Bank for now for over 15 years.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:56):**  I really started as a loan officer and always the clients facing and talking with entrepreneurs  
**[0:03:02-0:03:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:02):**  and seeing how we could connect the money of our savers, of our savings accounts to  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:10):**  sustainable entrepreneurs.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:11):**  I used to work at SME with SME Finance and also did something in organic agriculture,  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:18):**  then moved to sustainable real estate finance.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:22):**  And approximately seven years ago, I switched to Triodos Investment Management, where I  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:26):**  started to work as a senior investment manager first and then later as a fund manager, always  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:31):**  being in contact with European entrepreneurs active in the organic food space and food  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:38):**  transition.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:39):**  So it sounds like you have a good background to be our first guest.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:41):**  I think we couldn't have wished for better.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:43):**  I mean, me and Benedikt were discussing who should be the first on the series.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:47):**  And we definitely want to kick off with the bank because for many people, I think the  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:51):**  first response when you mentioned transition finance is, why don't these farmers that are  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:55):**  front runners, pioneers, et cetera, why don't they just and just between brackets here,  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:00):**  which you cannot see, don't go to their local bank or don't go to a bank.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:04):**  And I think we wanted to explore that because it's as we had in a pre discussion, it's much  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:08):**  more complex than that.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:09):**  And we didn't want to just invite any bank.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:11):**  We want to invite one of the most sustainable banks we know, which is the Triodos Bank.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:15):**  But for anybody that now thinks Triodos, I might have heard about the name, or I might  
**[0:04:20-0:04:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:20):**  did not.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:21):**  Can you give a bit of an intro into Triodos Bank and Triodos Investment Management?  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:25):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:26):**  Happy to do so.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:27):**  Triodos Bank was founded almost 40 years ago by, let's say, by a group of bankers who really  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:35):**  want to do it differently.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:37):**  And we wanted to create a strong connection between the money that's in the savings account  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:41):**  and the, let's say, the loans that are provided to entrepreneurs.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:46):**  So really make that strong connection, make it also transparent.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:50):**  So we also report on where your money goes to and where we invest.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:56):**  And we strongly believe in the power of money.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:58):**  So with the loan decisions or the investment decisions that you take, that you take within  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:05:05):**  the next 10 years, will have an effect for the next 100 years.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:05:10):**  So it's really Triodos was founded to guide money into a certain direction, into a positive  
**[0:05:16-0:05:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:05:16):**  direction, which I would say, like most other banks now also have, or that's starting, is  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:05:25):**  that they have criteria that they exclude, for instance, the weapon industry or tobacco.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:05:32):**  But we at Triodos really are focused on transition finance and want to finance that change.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:05:39):**  And we do it now within Triodos Bank in several countries.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:05:42):**  So originally it was founded in the Netherlands, but we now also have offices and branches  
**[0:05:47-0:05:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:05:47):**  in Belgium and Germany, in the UK, and in Spain.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:05:54):**  And we've also expanded, so we have a bank, which is the core of our activity, which is  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:00):**  really getting or attracting savings from retail customers and lending that to sustainable  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:06):**  entrepreneurs.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:08):**  And next to that, we have a business unit called Triodos Investment Management, where  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:13):**  we manage multiple investment funds that are active in several themes like the bank, food  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:19):**  and agriculture, renewable energy, and social inclusion.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:24):**  But our field of working is the entire world.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:26):**  So we have some funds that are active in emerging markets, some are in Europe, some are in the  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:33):**  Netherlands, and some provide, it's the full range of from debt to equity.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:40):**  And next to that, we also have several funds that invest in listed companies.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:46):**  So we have, it's actually two activities within Triodos Investment Management.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:51):**  One is focused on private debt and equity.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:55):**  And the other bit of our activity is on listed companies.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:58):**  So where we strongly engage with listed companies to push their sustainable agenda as well.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:06):**  And what's also good to mention is that our motto, so to say, is finance change and change  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:12):**  finance.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:13):**  And we are, let's say, we want to be the leading European sustainable bank.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:18):**  But we also always look for networking.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:21):**  I think that also ties in to the subject of today.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:25):**  I think it was 10 years ago that we were also one of the launching partners of the Global  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:30):**  Alliance for Banking on Values, which is a global network of sustainable banks.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:36):**  And with that network, we really tried to be a front runner and be an ambassador of  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:42):**  sustainable finance.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:43):**  So I say we have two main activities, and one is really to finance those entrepreneurs  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:51):**  that really support the transition.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:54):**  But we also realize that we cannot do it on our own.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:56):**  So that's why we're also busy with changing finance and showing others that it's possible.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:03):**  And also, hopefully, inspiring others to also move into this direction.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:08):**  Because all the challenges that we're facing requires significant effort.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:13):**  So everybody who can help is needed.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:16):**  Right.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:17):**  I mean, Julian, also from my side, it's so great to have you on the call.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:23):**  And I mean, from just what you've been saying, you pretty much touched upon all the potential,  
**[0:08:28-0:08:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:28):**  yeah, I mean, I guess, problems or the potential topics and I guess also responsibilities that  
**[0:08:35-0:08:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:35):**  you have to keep in mind, right?  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:36):**  I mean, starting from saying, look, this is money from our savers.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:41):**  You have a certain responsibility to invest it.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:44):**  At the same time, as a bank, you obviously have regulation you have to adhere to.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:48):**  And then combining that with an approach and an aim to say, well, we want to drive change,  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:53):**  and we want to facilitate entrepreneurs to do that also.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:57):**  I mean, that's really what it's all about.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:00):**  So great to have you.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:02):**  One question just from my side at this point is really, how do you, is there sort of like  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:07):**  a sales split between those two activities, you know, working with listed companies on  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:12):**  the one side, and having entrepreneurs on the other?  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:15):**  And would you argue it's sort of a combination that you're, let's say, working with with  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:19):**  the list of companies in order to be facilitated, you know, maybe even hatch some risk of the  
**[0:09:24-0:09:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:24):**  work that you do with entrepreneurs?  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:26):**  No, in that sense, it is two different.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:30):**  Also within investment management, it is two activities, and it's not mixed.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:34):**  The approach is the same.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:35):**  So it's always focused on the transition teams.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:38):**  We don't mix those asset classes in that perspective.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:42):**  But we are, let's say, offering the full range to our investors and really make sure that  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:49):**  we activate their money in the direction that they want and also that asset owners want.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:54):**  So they, not everybody, so there is a different type of risk involved when you invest in listed  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:01):**  companies or when you invest in private equity or private debt.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:04):**  And I think it's for us most important that we cater to the needs of those investors and  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:11):**  that we connect them to either listed companies or to private enterprises.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:15):**  Right.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:16):**  I mean, that was, you know, a bit the question that I was trying to get to.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:22):**  Obviously, it's very different risk classes.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:25):**  So the question is, well, really what I was trying to get at from experiencing those different  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:32):**  forms of transition phases, is there already something that you can see, you know, that  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:37):**  is maybe an instrument that we can also apply in agriculture?  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:41):**  I think it's an excellent question.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:43):**  Just to color it a bit, I think you at Triodos have done a lot of work in the organic space  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:47):**  and the transition to organic.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:49):**  And now we're sort of entering the, I think Benedict uses a beautiful term, beyond organic  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:55):**  or beyond farming phase where there's still a lot to figure out and they're not really  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:00):**  clear recipes for farmers that want to go a lot further than the organic space.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:06):**  How is it for a bank and an investment management company to see that movement happening and  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:10):**  what kind of role can you play there?  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:12):**  What kind of instruments like Benedict do you see already instruments or how would you  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:15):**  approach a few steps in the unknown, basically going beyond organic and farmers like Benedict  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:20):**  but also others that are taking slowly but definitely surely those steps?  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:25):**  Yeah, I think so.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:27):**  As I touched on the instruments later, but first of all, your question is how do you  
**[0:11:32-0:11:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:32):**  deal as Triodos, indeed, we already from our origination are supportive of the biodynamic  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:40):**  and the organic farming sector.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:42):**  But we've also launched, so last year we published our new vision on food and agriculture and  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:50):**  on agricultural systems.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:52):**  We're kind of saying that we need to take next steps and it's not so much of fixing  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:57):**  the current system, but really trying to move towards a new and a better food and agricultural  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:12:02):**  system, which is focused on three pillars.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:12:06):**  So one is the balanced ecosystems and I think that definitely includes part of organic,  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:12:12):**  but where we also say sometimes, let's say the holistic vision that you need to have  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:12:17):**  on a new system isn't fully covered by an organic certified farmer and sometimes sustainable  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:12:24):**  farmers are not certified organic.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:12:28):**  So you need to look beyond that.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:12:30):**  To give a bit more background on that vision, we're going to say there are three pillars.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:12:34):**  So one is balanced ecosystem, which is very much focused on making sure that agriculture  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:12:40):**  happens and that we work together with nature instead of against it and actually damaging  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:12:45):**  the natural system that the food system is depending on.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:12:48):**  But it's also making sure that, let's say, with a health, that we create a healthy society,  
**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:12:53):**  that we create the nutrition that we need and that we really, in that perspective, really  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:00):**  make sure that we produce the right nutrients and that we produce the right food.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:04):**  And then the third pillar is making sure that everybody in the value chain gets actually  
**[0:13:08-0:13:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:08):**  its fair share and what we then call, it needs to deliver inclusive prosperity and just make  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:15):**  sure that everybody who's active in that value chain actually gets its fair share.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:19):**  And I think this kind of already shows for us the next step where you can move beyond  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:26):**  organic farming or perhaps go back to the roots of organic farming, which is focused  
**[0:13:32-0:13:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:32):**  on multiple important issues, which is ecology, which is also care and its health and safe  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:40):**  and fairness.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:41):**  And I think not everything that's organically certified actually deals with all four of  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:48):**  the pillars of the organic agriculture.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:51):**  And that's what we're trying to reflect in the new vision that we published on Food and  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:56):**  Agriculture.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:57):**  Yeah, I will definitely link that below so everybody can read it.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:00):**  Yeah, that would be great.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:01):**  And it's really a holistic view of how we feel and how we can work to a more resilient  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:08):**  food system.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:09):**  And as I already mentioned, it needs to deliver healthy nutrition for all without damaging  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:14):**  the natural systems they depend on and make sure that we deliver inclusive prosperity  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:18):**  for those active in the food and agriculture chain.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:22):**  And I think that's for us what is most important.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:25):**  And historically, we still strongly support organic.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:29):**  But we also look at initiatives that go beyond organic, as long as they fit in this sustainable  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:35):**  ecosystem.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:36):**  But I think that also shows that it's all interrelated.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:41):**  So when we did the research for this study, we also found that you cannot solve this system  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:46):**  by, for instance, only focusing on fairness.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:52):**  Because then you also need to look at a balanced ecosystem and you need to make sure that you  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:57):**  focus on healthy society.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:58):**  That's what's necessary to need to be holistic.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:01):**  So it also means that you cannot solve it independently.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:04):**  And we are, as Creos, we're now trying to take the next steps based on this vision to  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:10):**  ask such great investable solutions.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:12):**  So for us, the next step is I think it was very important for us to do this research  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:17):**  and to really come to that holistic approach.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:20):**  And now we're really in the face of translating that into looking at them what's necessary,  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:26):**  but also then and then create investable solutions for our investors.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:30):**  So depending on their risk and return and impact profile, see like what can you create  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:35):**  in order to attract that money and attract the capital and deploy it in the right direction  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:41):**  to actually make this change happen?  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:44):**  And that's not easy.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:45):**  So in that sense, also the timing for this podcast for us is also, can also be an inspiration.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:51):**  And we have a track record.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:52):**  We've done this all, indeed, as you mentioned also with organic, and we still do.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:57):**  So one of the examples that I definitely want to mention is what we're doing within Traders  
**[0:16:01-0:16:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:16:01):**  Bank is that we are giving finance to farmers that are in a transition from conventional  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:16:09):**  agriculture to organic, where there is this three-year period in which it is not yet organic  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:16:15):**  certified, but you do already have to live by the organic rules.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:16:18):**  So you do have to incur already higher costs, et cetera, but you don't get the premium.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:16:24):**  And that transition, but also the investments that are necessary, that is something that  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:16:28):**  we, yeah, as Traders Bankers like to try to create a separate facility for that.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:16:34):**  And then also the conditions in the transition period are, for instance, that you don't need  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:16:41):**  to repay the loans, that it's postponed.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:16:44):**  Sometimes also the interest during that period can be part of the finance of the loan itself.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:16:50):**  So in that sense, we really try to support that transition.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:16:54):**  And we do that because we understand the dynamics in the organic market, and we see what's happening.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:00):**  So I think we have a clear insight in the risk profile of a farmer when they switch  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:05):**  to organic.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:07):**  And for me, that's the most important thing.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:09):**  So as a bank or as an investor, it all comes down to knowledge and really understanding  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:15):**  the risks that are involved.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:17):**  And then hopefully you also have a solution.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:20):**  It doesn't mean that you always have a solution.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:22):**  But for me, that is the advantage for us as Traders Bankers.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:25):**  This is what we do.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:26):**  We only finance organic agriculture.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:28):**  So we understand that sector, and we want to be supportive.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:32):**  And it's also the strong task that we've been given by our customers to make sure that their  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:37):**  money flows into that direction and supports that transition.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:41):**  So we're really anxiously working on those solutions.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:45):**  And I think that's what I was looking back.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:49):**  And now if you look forward with this vision, what we're now working on is also with partners  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:55):**  to see what can we do to finance transactions in which you purchase the land and perhaps  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:01):**  it's no longer owned by a farmer, but there's an entity in between.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:07):**  But it is extremely difficult to actually realize that.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:11):**  But we're also knowing that we have a bank and that we have investment management, but  
**[0:18:15-0:18:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:15):**  it's always a certain type of money and either gets an interest or it wants a certain return.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:23):**  We also have within Triodos, what we call the Triodos Regenerative Money Center, where  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:29):**  we really put all our activities together that are more focused on either gift money  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:35):**  or investments that do not require a high return.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:41):**  Really try to put that together and what we then call, try to create more Catholic activities.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:47):**  And so for us as Triodos, it's really the third activity.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:50):**  So next to the bank and the investments, really the Triodos Regenerative Money Center, where  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:56):**  we try to create an activity.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:59):**  But for us, that's also experimenting and where we try to create something and where  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:05):**  we want to support initiatives that are, as we call them, not yet bankable or not yet  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:09):**  investable, but that do require money.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:13):**  I think there's a lot to unpack there.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:15):**  Thank you for that.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:16):**  Benedict, do you want to jump in?  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:19):**  I was going to say that sounds familiar.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:22):**  Yeah, I mean, I think it's a great approach because I mean, there's just so many unknowns,  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:27):**  right?  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:28):**  Just to give you an example from us, I mean, we are on a very sandy soil.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:32):**  We have huge problems with drought, especially in spring, early spring, beginning of the  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:38):**  summer.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:39):**  So that has a huge impact on the profitability, obviously, or being able to harvest something  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:45):**  at all.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:46):**  So that being said, let's say the current plot size here are around 40 hectares.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:50):**  So with that, we have huge problems with erosion, wind erosion, obviously, it's also water erosion,  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:57):**  extreme weather conditions.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:59):**  The soil is often then very hard, it's not capable of taking up the large sums of water  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:04):**  that are coming.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:05):**  So because of those kind of topics, we have to really think about how we can preserve  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:11):**  the little rain that is falling in the best possible way as a grain oriented or at the  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:17):**  moment still grain oriented agriculture company.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:22):**  We are very strongly involved in thinking about and obviously also applying agroforestry  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:28):**  ideas, right?  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:29):**  So we have different structures and different, let's say methodologies of agroforestry, one  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:33):**  where we go more into sort of the, let's say the ecological functions that a couple of  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:38):**  rows of agroforestry on a large field can offer, basically by changing the microclimate  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:43):**  between the rows, basically by helping also in the water intake, but having those positive  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:48):**  effects on potential erosion through wind and water.  
**[0:20:53-0:21:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:53):**  But then also, in an idea to also think about the potential value add through the tree lines  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:02):**  themselves, right?  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:03):**  So go into a more diverse, more biodiverse system where you have different potentially  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:09):**  nut trees, you have fruit trees, you have fruit bushes, and that's only a start.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:13):**  You can have a huge variety of different, yeah, let's say fruit bearing trees, I guess,  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:20):**  developing in some sort of product that you can market depending on where you are and  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:25):**  what kind of situation you have.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:29):**  And especially in Germany, there is not that much research on those kind of multifunctional  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:35):**  land use models.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:37):**  And specifically when it comes to single trees and then within one species, the different  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:44):**  varieties and then combining that with, let's say those very, very harsh conditions that  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:49):**  we have, we often in the year have late frosts danger as well.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:53):**  So what we're doing in one plot, it's a 3.5 hectare.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:57):**  We have 19 tree rows.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:59):**  The area between those two rows is 10 meters.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:02):**  We have planted around 1,700 different trees and bushes.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:06):**  And these are pretty much the whole variety that I kind of already touched upon.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:13):**  And there's one row basically to give you an example, which is on plums and berries.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:18):**  And there we have, for example, 17 different plum varieties because we need to invest the  
**[0:22:25-0:22:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:25):**  time now.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:26):**  We need to invest those next, let's say two or three years in order to have a feeling  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:30):**  of which of those varieties can actually cope with the kind of harsh environment that we  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:36):**  are and that will be increasingly we're facing.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:39):**  So although being convinced that this holds huge potential, especially in an area like  
**[0:22:45-0:22:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:45):**  Eastern Brandenburg, we don't know on a, let's say, bankable, responsible basis what the  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:54):**  profits could be, what the cost structures will be, what kind of metrics we have to know  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:59):**  and we have to get a feeling for in order to make it a bankable product.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:23:03):**  So I think that already shows you quite well how what you just said is very true.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:23:11):**  And I think the funny thing is, and this is something where part of the transition or  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:23:17):**  part of this paradigm shift is going towards also that we are realizing that there's just  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:23:22):**  no silver bullet.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:23:23):**  We have to be aware of the complexity of the ecosystem that we're in and we have to be  
**[0:23:29-0:23:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:23:29):**  aware that we have to be able to find solutions that fit into certain contexts at a certain  
**[0:23:36-0:23:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:23:36):**  time and with regard also to the people who are being or running it basically.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:23:44):**  So that was a long reply to a fairly easy question, but I think we are at this point,  
**[0:23:51-0:24:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:23:51):**  where we have to do that groundwork and gather data, gather more information and learn more  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:00):**  to then say, okay, from what we've seen, from what we have analyzed, we pretty know what  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:06):**  can work in which kind of environment.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:10):**  So having that, let's say, regenerative money center, I think is a great and really, really  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:16):**  important first step, I guess.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:19):**  Yeah, and thank you and also for giving some more background.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:22):**  And I think for me, this also clearly shows that, as you mentioned, there's not one solution  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:29):**  and it's not a clear solution as well.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:31):**  So it's more entrepreneurial.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:34):**  That means, unfortunately, what I think is a good development is that there's more and  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:40):**  more attention to our agricultural system and also the impact that agriculture has on  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:45):**  climate change.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:47):**  And I say the impact, but also the fact that it can be part of the solution.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:51):**  So I think if you look at the European Green Deal that they're kind of working on and also  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:56):**  the fact that they want to plant significant amount of trees, I think for me, agriculture  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:02):**  is should be part of that solution.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:05):**  And we should not think of climate change.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:08):**  So it's all linked to each other.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:11):**  And if you link it, then you can actually also see that there are business models, indeed,  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:14):**  when you talk about agroforestry.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:18):**  Then that's what we're also in contact with some other organizations, for instance, ReWilding  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:22):**  Europe, which is very much focused on how can we make a business model out of creating  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:28):**  nature and especially with the challenges that we're facing when it comes down to climate  
**[0:25:32-0:25:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:32):**  change.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:33):**  You can now see that capital is flowing into a certain direction.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:38):**  And what we now need to do is, what I think is very important is that we collect those  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:44):**  efforts and that we also guide them to the direction of agriculture.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:48):**  And yes, a fair part should go to technology that is already there and that we can scale.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:54):**  But we also need to make sure that we give that also funds flow to more, let's say, the  
**[0:26:01-0:26:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:01):**  pioneers because it is necessary.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:04):**  It's a new pioneering stage.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:05):**  And I always like the example that within Trials, when there was in the Netherlands,  
**[0:26:10-0:26:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:10):**  the first wind turbine on land, and it was very difficult also to get the finance and  
**[0:26:18-0:26:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:18):**  the business case.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:19):**  And then there were several customers of Trials who actually said at that time, well, just  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:24):**  give us a lower interest rate and we're fine with taking a lower interest rate, as long  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:29):**  as you also give a lower interest rate to that wind turbine.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:32):**  And then all of a sudden, it was possible.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:35):**  So I think it's that creative thinking and what you're saying.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:41):**  The challenge that you have is with the soil, and then perhaps a solution is planting more  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:45):**  trees with agroforestry.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:46):**  Then actually, what does it bring?  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:48):**  It also makes sure that you stand out potentially in a retail outlet.  
**[0:26:53-0:27:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:53):**  And then hopefully, also consumers are willing to pay a bit more.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:00):**  And perhaps retailers are willing to make a longer term contract with you as a farmer.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:06):**  And then you need a financial institution who understands that people in the value chain  
**[0:27:11-0:27:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:11):**  are thinking differently and are really trying to work together.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:15):**  And that also lowers the risk.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:16):**  And then all of a sudden, perhaps it does become bankable.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:19):**  I think it's a great example of the energy space, that it started with the small wind  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:25):**  turbine on land somewhere, which at the moment, at that time, maybe wasn't bankable.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:30):**  And in your understanding of the bank space, what are the timelines we have to think about?  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:36):**  Because it's clearly that we're in a pioneering space.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:38):**  And it's clearly that Benedict and many others are literally finding out what works and what  
**[0:27:44-0:27:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:44):**  doesn't.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:45):**  And Benedict says, maybe in a few years, in two, three years, we have a better understanding  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:48):**  which plums and which trees, et cetera.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:50):**  But for a bank, how long did it take for organic to be bankable or for solar to be bankable  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:55):**  and what kind of years are we thinking about?  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:57):**  Is that five years of records or 10 or maybe even 15 before it becomes easy for obviously  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:03):**  a very structured and regulated entity like a bank?  
**[0:28:09-0:28:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:09):**  That's a difficult question, Koen.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:12):**  Yeah, and not easy to answer.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:14):**  And I think that what's most important is that, so my heart would like to say, you have  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:22):**  a good plan, work together with partners and then come to a bank and then make sure that  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:26):**  they understand.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:27):**  And then it should be bankable.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:29):**  But indeed, I think you need to think about a timeframe of, let's say, three to five years.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:33):**  But that's a bit pessimistic.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:35):**  So hopefully, it can be somewhere in the middle.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:38):**  Well, we want the honest answer.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:40):**  What's the banker saying?  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:41):**  What is your banker mind?  
**[0:28:43-0:28:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:43):**  Because many, I think many people listening don't have the luxury to have a trios within  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:50):**  their reach.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:51):**  They can check the Global Alliance on banking on values, but they would have a more traditional  
**[0:28:55-0:28:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:55):**  bank.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:56):**  So they would have to face this more, maybe more pessimistic or less knowledgeable person  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:01):**  on agriculture, future of agriculture.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:03):**  To not give them too much hope, you would say three to five and maybe even a bit more  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:07):**  than that.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:08):**  Yeah, no, but I think, I mean, you need one or two years of track record.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:13):**  So you need a pioneering phase.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:16):**  And then you need one or two years where you actually show that it works.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:19):**  Let's say that's more in general.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:21):**  And then in the pioneering phase, you might be able to do it earlier.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:27):**  But if you talk about scale, and I think that's it.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:29):**  So we shouldn't, I think this is a great example, your firm, Benedict, but it's also, I mean,  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:36):**  financing one project, it's always possible.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:38):**  So that the banker says, well, we're going to do it anyway, because we want to finance  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:42):**  that pioneer.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:43):**  But I think if you talk about scale, it needs to be something that indeed is proven.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:48):**  And then indeed, you're talking, I would say three to five years.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:53):**  And also, if you look at the renewable energy market, as it took several years to really  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:57):**  become mature, and then all of a sudden, and now you see lots of capital flowing in already  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:02):**  for several years.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:04):**  So I think for the upcoming two to three years, you are still stuck in the pioneering phase  
**[0:30:11-0:30:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:11):**  and you need pioneers and either, and then, yeah.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:19):**  So pioneering capital and more risk capital.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:22):**  And then I would say like three to five years, what you need before it's really on a bigger  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:27):**  scale, it's bankable.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:28):**  And it's also then becomes an asset class that's attractive for other banks as well,  
**[0:30:33-0:30:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:33):**  beyond the impact investment space.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:36):**  Yeah, I think the question really is how can you make it like an asset class that is sort  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:43):**  of understood by everyone and accepted with a certain risk profile.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:48):**  And the question is, how do we get there?  
**[0:30:49-0:31:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:49):**  And I think from our experience as well, I think it's really about having those examples,  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:31:00):**  having farmers in different zones and different problems with different, maybe also let's  
**[0:31:07-0:31:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:31:07):**  say focus and having them as let's say pioneers show what they're doing, how they're doing  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:31:15):**  it, what kind of problems they face, how they find solutions and basically support them  
**[0:31:20-0:31:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:31:20):**  because politicians, the public, consumers, other farmers, all of them, they need to go  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:31:28):**  to those places, to the farmers, speak to the farmer.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:31:31):**  They have to see at those new ways.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:31:33):**  They have to touch them.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:31:35):**  They have to experience them.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:31:36):**  I think only through experiences can people who are not connected as strongly into those  
**[0:31:42-0:31:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:31:42):**  things understand and build a sort of interest, possibly love to then say, okay, I mean, in  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:31:51):**  my role, I can do something towards the move and the change to help that kind of new paradigm  
**[0:31:57-0:32:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:31:57):**  of agriculture basically to get a strong foothold and to get a better price, to be more open  
**[0:32:04-0:32:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:04):**  and the whole trading scheme and so forth.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:06):**  So I think it's a really important step to find people that already are trying to do  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:13):**  those kinds of things and then put them in the spotlight, I guess.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:17):**  And I think it also goes down to trust.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:20):**  So indeed, when you look at it from a consumer perspective, and so one of our portfolio companies  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:26):**  of the Treaters Organic Growth Fund is a company called Allstead and that's a meal box company  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:31):**  from Denmark.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:33):**  And so what they really, they source from Denmark, but also from other countries in  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:39):**  Europe, organic fruit and vegetables, put it in a box together with other ingredients  
**[0:32:44-0:32:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:44):**  to prepare, let's say, a healthy and sustainable meal at your home, so you can make it yourself.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:52):**  But this is an organization that's now also trusted by their customers and knowing that  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:57):**  if you buy over there, it might be, it's organic food and vegetables and it might be more expensive  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:03):**  than conventional, but at least you know that they have a long-term relationship with their  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:09):**  suppliers.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:10):**  And then you're potentially also willing to pay a bit more because you trust them.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:14):**  And I think we've somehow built a very efficient food system, which was necessary because we  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:20):**  really focused on making sure that everybody had sufficient nutrients and sufficient food  
**[0:33:25-0:33:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:25):**  available.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:26):**  And that's, of course, still a challenge, but I think now times are changing and we  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:31):**  need to create a structure in which there's, yeah, there's trust in the system and everybody  
**[0:33:36-0:33:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:36):**  gets this fair share.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:39):**  And then also consumers are, I think they're not unwilling to pay a bit more, but then  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:45):**  what for them is what needs to be crystal clear is that if they pay a bit more, that  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:51):**  that also goes to the farmers actually.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:53):**  And so for me, it's really building the trust and making it, and now somehow what you also  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:59):**  mentioned, Benedict, it's now an anonymous food system.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:04):**  And indeed what you're saying, if you open up your farm, then the people reconnect and  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:08):**  they really see the value of food instead of trying to buy it as cheap as possible.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:14):**  I was just going to ask a final question.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:16):**  I wanted to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:19):**  Usually these final questions turn into a few more, but what would be your advice, Julian,  
**[0:34:24-0:34:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:24):**  to, I think the advice of Benedict is clear.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:26):**  Go to your farmer, talk, understand, taste, touch, understand the food system, understand  
**[0:34:32-0:34:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:32):**  these pioneers much more.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:33):**  What would be your advice to investors listening to the space?  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:37):**  Maybe people working in the finance sector, so your colleagues or competitors, but let's  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:41):**  say farmers listening to that are maybe pioneering here.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:45):**  What would be your advice that in five to 10 years, this will be a bankable asset class  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:51):**  that we can all participate in?  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:54):**  What should they do tomorrow or today if they serve a full day?  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:59):**  Yeah, as already mentioned, we always look at it from a risk return and impact perspective.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:04):**  And I would say it's a first step for now in this pioneering phase.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:07):**  You need to get it crystal clear what the risks are, which are obviously higher, what  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:15):**  the returns are, which is definitely challenging, and what the impact is.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:18):**  And make that also clear.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:20):**  And I think if you have that clarity, you can find funds or people or organizations  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:28):**  that where this impact risk return profile actually matches with what they're looking  
**[0:35:33-0:35:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:33):**  for.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:34):**  But also have a clear strategy on indeed how do you make this scalable?  
**[0:35:39-0:35:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:39):**  So what's your goal?  
**[0:35:40-0:35:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:40):**  How do you feel that in the end, you can turn this into a wider movement instead of what's  
**[0:35:47-0:35:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:47):**  next beyond the pioneering phase?  
**[0:35:49-0:35:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:49):**  But I think for now, we need all brainpower to really think about, as already mentioned,  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:56):**  the impact risk and return of this project.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:00):**  And also from the traditional finance sector, from consumers, and from large food companies.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:11):**  Collect all of that.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:13):**  Understand that potentially not everybody can for now help, but at least involve them  
**[0:36:18-0:36:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:18):**  and make them ready for the next step.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:21):**  And that they understand so that the moment you want to reach more scale, they better  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:26):**  understand the risk that they're getting into, and also the return and the impact that they're  
**[0:36:31-0:36:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:31):**  able to make.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:32):**  Maybe also one question from my side.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:34):**  I had the honor to moderate a panel on regenerative agriculture at the Farm and Food 4.0, which  
**[0:36:41-0:36:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:41):**  is always a very well known conference on innovation in agriculture, specifically in  
**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:48):**  startups, ag tech, but also this year regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:53):**  And we spoke about the topic also, do we really have the time?  
**[0:36:58-0:37:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:58):**  And can we afford as a society, as farmers, as consumers, as people to wait until we are  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:37:07):**  able to satisfactorily take the next step?  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:37:11):**  And often, Indigo obviously is one of those companies that are at the forefront of articulating  
**[0:37:17-0:37:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:37:17):**  the whole potential of CO2 intake.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:37:19):**  This is something, I'm sure, you mentioned briefly as well.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:37:24):**  In my view, only speaking about sequestering carbon and then having a vehicle, so to say,  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:37:33):**  that pays the farmer, that's again not taking care of the complexity of the ecosystem, I  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:37:38):**  think.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:37:39):**  So we have to look at it more holistically.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:37:41):**  And if we agree on that, and I think we do, don't we, as of now, actually have to start  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:37:48):**  much stronger discussion on the whole concept of true cost accounting and say, look, if  
**[0:37:52-0:37:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:37:52):**  you're a farmer in an arid region, if you're a farmer where you have great potential yields,  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:37:59):**  don't we have to find a holistic management or let's say measurement tool to say, okay,  
**[0:38:05-0:38:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:38:05):**  there's different ways a farmer is contributing, either through high production of grain or  
**[0:38:14-0:38:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:38:14):**  a large potential to sequester carbon or a huge, let's say, potential for increasing  
**[0:38:22-0:38:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:38:22):**  biodiversity and so forth.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:38:23):**  And don't we have to think about that so much stronger to see how can we facilitate the  
**[0:38:30-0:38:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:38:30):**  change of farmers much quicker?  
**[0:38:32-0:38:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:38:32):**  Because after the panel, there was farmers approaching people at the Farm and Food and  
**[0:38:38-0:38:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:38:38):**  said, look, we want to change.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:38:40):**  We have x, y, z hectares, but we don't actually have all of the skill set that we need.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:38:48):**  We don't have the right machines yet.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:38:50):**  We don't have the finance to, let's say, cover a year of maybe three, four, five, six, seven  
**[0:38:58-0:39:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:38:58):**  years where you will go through a bit of a dip, obviously.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:01):**  What can we do?  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:02):**  And isn't that the kind of question that we have to ask ourselves?  
**[0:39:06-0:39:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:06):**  How can we find an innovative, holistic tool of financing those transitions?  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:13):**  Also a paradigm shift in how we think about finance, if you want.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:17):**  I know that's a bit of a weird question, but do you know what I'm trying to get at, Jeroen?  
**[0:39:25-0:39:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:25):**  Yeah, I think so.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:27):**  And I think I definitely agree.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:30):**  So you need to have, I think in the end, that's also where we should be heading to.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:37):**  And as you also mentioned, we have no time to waste.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:40):**  And I also think that this holistic system, it can be a significant step.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:44):**  And then, of course, the question is, will we be able to take that leap?  
**[0:39:49-0:39:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:49):**  So for me, it also, again, starts with pioneers and just starting small.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:55):**  And starting small while not forgetting about the bigger picture and constantly thinking,  
**[0:39:59-0:40:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:59):**  like, can we already scale it?  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:01):**  What do we additional need?  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:03):**  Perhaps potentially what type of larger corporations are out there who will be willing to support  
**[0:40:09-0:40:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:09):**  this?  
**[0:40:10-0:40:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:10):**  But I definitely agree.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:11):**  I mean, in the end, and that's also what our vision is about.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:15):**  It is about this holistic change.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:18):**  It's not just paying a bit more for your veggies in the supermarket so that the farmer gets  
**[0:40:27-0:40:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:27):**  a bit more income.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:28):**  Now, it's really about really changing, eating more local, shifting a diet, circular agriculture,  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:36):**  agroforestry.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:37):**  It all needs to be included, but it's also extremely complex.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:42):**  And that's why I always like this combination of, yes, we need to think about an holistic  
**[0:40:47-0:40:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:47):**  system.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:48):**  And we also need to, yesterday, start working on a solution, which is just the first step.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:55):**  Yeah, I think we're opening, we're moving into a whole new discussion, which I think  
**[0:41:01-0:41:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:01):**  we need to have, but not this time on the podcast.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:04):**  I think that should be another one.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:05):**  I feel the tension constantly of we need to move yesterday as much as possible.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:11):**  And obviously, I also see the potential issues or the challenges that institutions have because  
**[0:41:18-0:41:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:18):**  they're not investing their own money.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:20):**  And at the same time, I hear you, Benedict, like we need a couple of years to figure out  
**[0:41:23-0:41:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:23):**  which plums we actually need to plant.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:25):**  But of course, you would love to already know that and plant them everywhere in the right  
**[0:41:29-0:41:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:29):**  mix.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:30):**  So there's this constant tension of going very fast.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:32):**  And at the same time, we somehow cannot go faster than certain principles are.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:37):**  So I think it's one of the reasons we're recording this.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:41):**  And one of the reasons I'm so happy you, Jurijen, came on the first official episode with a  
**[0:41:47-0:41:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:47):**  guest of the Transition Finance series.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:48):**  I want to thank you both again for so much to join and also the whole team at Triodos  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:54):**  to make this happen.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:55):**  And I don't think it's the last time we are discussing and we're sharing on Transition  
**[0:41:59-0:42:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:59):**  Finance and regenerative agriculture and food systems.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:42:02):**  Yeah, thank you.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:42:03):**  And again, thank you for having me and having this opportunity to discuss this with you,  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:42:09):**  Koen, and with Benedict.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:42:11):**  And well, be continued.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:42:13):**  Yeah, very much looking forward to this discussion.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:42:16):**  And yeah, I mean, Triodos is at the forefront of this development.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:42:19):**  So all eyes are on you guys.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:42:21):**  No pressure, but no pressure.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:42:25):**  We can only solve it together.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:42:26):**  And I think you guys are doing a great job.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:42:29):**  So awesome to have you on board as well.

### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2020-02-11)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:00):**  In this interview, we will learn how one of the most sustainable banks in the world, Triodos,  approaches financing transitions in energy and food, and what the role of banks can be  now and will be in the future when it comes to financing farmers who want to go beyond  sustainable towards regeneration.  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:30):**  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  Why are we recording this series?  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the gurus on their  farms, explored farm-size regenerative designs, and most importantly started their pilots  
**[0:00:49-0:00:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:00:49):**  and feedback loops.  This is where transition finance is key.  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of flexibility,  and the farmers' lack of collateral.  Furthermore, there's a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give  
**[0:01:05-0:01:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:05):**  away.  That is why my co-host, aspiring-to-be regenerative farmer, Benedikt BÃ¶sel, and I are embarking  on a journey to find out what are the key principles of transition finance for regenerative  farmers.  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative agriculture and food finance  
**[0:01:23-0:01:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:23):**  space.  They share their insights, how they would finance the speed-up of the regenerative transition  on Benedikt's 1,000 hectares, which is almost 2,500 acres, farm in Germany close to Berlin.  This is an open process.  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:40):**  We don't have the answers yet.  That's a lot of questions.  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other inspiration, people  to interview, etc.  Get in touch via the contact page on the website, investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:01:54):**  That is investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  So welcome to a new episode in the transition finance series.  And a very warm welcome to my co-host, Benedikt.  Welcome back on the show.  Yes, happy to be here.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:10):**  And a very warm welcome to our first guest we ever have on this series, which is Jurijan  Appers, fund manager of Triodos Organic Growth Fund, which is part of Triodos Investment  Management.  And he also spent quite a bit of time at Triodos Bank.  Welcome Jurijan.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:25):**  Yeah.  Hi, Koen.  Happy to be here.  Hi, Benedikt.  Hi, there.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:30):**  So I always like to ask a personal question and to briefly introduce you, yourself basically,  and why you're so focused on food and agriculture.  Yeah.  Well, first of all, thank you for having me on your podcast and on the series.  And it's a pleasure being the first in this series.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:02:49):**  And a bit of my background, I've been working at Triodos Bank for now for over 15 years.  I really started as a loan officer and always the clients facing and talking with entrepreneurs  and seeing how we could connect the money of our savers, of our savings accounts to  sustainable entrepreneurs.  I used to work at SME with SME Finance and also did something in organic agriculture,  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:18):**  then moved to sustainable real estate finance.  And approximately seven years ago, I switched to Triodos Investment Management, where I  started to work as a senior investment manager first and then later as a fund manager, always  being in contact with European entrepreneurs active in the organic food space and food  transition.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:39):**  So it sounds like you have a good background to be our first guest.  I think we couldn't have wished for better.  I mean, me and Benedikt were discussing who should be the first on the series.  And we definitely want to kick off with the bank because for many people, I think the  first response when you mentioned transition finance is, why don't these farmers that are  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:03:55):**  front runners, pioneers, et cetera, why don't they just and just between brackets here,  which you cannot see, don't go to their local bank or don't go to a bank.  And I think we wanted to explore that because it's as we had in a pre discussion, it's much  more complex than that.  And we didn't want to just invite any bank.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:11):**  We want to invite one of the most sustainable banks we know, which is the Triodos Bank.  But for anybody that now thinks Triodos, I might have heard about the name, or I might  did not.  Can you give a bit of an intro into Triodos Bank and Triodos Investment Management?  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:26):**  Happy to do so.  Triodos Bank was founded almost 40 years ago by, let's say, by a group of bankers who really  want to do it differently.  And we wanted to create a strong connection between the money that's in the savings account  and the, let's say, the loans that are provided to entrepreneurs.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:04:46):**  So really make that strong connection, make it also transparent.  So we also report on where your money goes to and where we invest.  And we strongly believe in the power of money.  So with the loan decisions or the investment decisions that you take, that you take within  the next 10 years, will have an effect for the next 100 years.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:05:10):**  So it's really Triodos was founded to guide money into a certain direction, into a positive  direction, which I would say, like most other banks now also have, or that's starting, is  that they have criteria that they exclude, for instance, the weapon industry or tobacco.  But we at Triodos really are focused on transition finance and want to finance that change.  And we do it now within Triodos Bank in several countries.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:05:42):**  So originally it was founded in the Netherlands, but we now also have offices and branches  in Belgium and Germany, in the UK, and in Spain.  And we've also expanded, so we have a bank, which is the core of our activity, which is  really getting or attracting savings from retail customers and lending that to sustainable  entrepreneurs.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:08):**  And next to that, we have a business unit called Triodos Investment Management, where  we manage multiple investment funds that are active in several themes like the bank, food  and agriculture, renewable energy, and social inclusion.  But our field of working is the entire world.  So we have some funds that are active in emerging markets, some are in Europe, some are in the  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:33):**  Netherlands, and some provide, it's the full range of from debt to equity.  And next to that, we also have several funds that invest in listed companies.  So we have, it's actually two activities within Triodos Investment Management.  One is focused on private debt and equity.  And the other bit of our activity is on listed companies.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:06:58):**  So where we strongly engage with listed companies to push their sustainable agenda as well.  And what's also good to mention is that our motto, so to say, is finance change and change  finance.  And we are, let's say, we want to be the leading European sustainable bank.  But we also always look for networking.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:21):**  I think that also ties in to the subject of today.  I think it was 10 years ago that we were also one of the launching partners of the Global  Alliance for Banking on Values, which is a global network of sustainable banks.  And with that network, we really tried to be a front runner and be an ambassador of  sustainable finance.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:07:43):**  So I say we have two main activities, and one is really to finance those entrepreneurs  that really support the transition.  But we also realize that we cannot do it on our own.  So that's why we're also busy with changing finance and showing others that it's possible.  And also, hopefully, inspiring others to also move into this direction.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:08):**  Because all the challenges that we're facing requires significant effort.  So everybody who can help is needed.  Right.  I mean, Julian, also from my side, it's so great to have you on the call.  And I mean, from just what you've been saying, you pretty much touched upon all the potential,  
**[0:08:28-0:08:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:28):**  yeah, I mean, I guess, problems or the potential topics and I guess also responsibilities that  you have to keep in mind, right?  I mean, starting from saying, look, this is money from our savers.  You have a certain responsibility to invest it.  At the same time, as a bank, you obviously have regulation you have to adhere to.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:08:48):**  And then combining that with an approach and an aim to say, well, we want to drive change,  and we want to facilitate entrepreneurs to do that also.  I mean, that's really what it's all about.  So great to have you.  One question just from my side at this point is really, how do you, is there sort of like  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:07):**  a sales split between those two activities, you know, working with listed companies on  the one side, and having entrepreneurs on the other?  And would you argue it's sort of a combination that you're, let's say, working with with  the list of companies in order to be facilitated, you know, maybe even hatch some risk of the  work that you do with entrepreneurs?  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:26):**  No, in that sense, it is two different.  Also within investment management, it is two activities, and it's not mixed.  The approach is the same.  So it's always focused on the transition teams.  We don't mix those asset classes in that perspective.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:09:42):**  But we are, let's say, offering the full range to our investors and really make sure that  we activate their money in the direction that they want and also that asset owners want.  So they, not everybody, so there is a different type of risk involved when you invest in listed  companies or when you invest in private equity or private debt.  And I think it's for us most important that we cater to the needs of those investors and  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:11):**  that we connect them to either listed companies or to private enterprises.  Right.  I mean, that was, you know, a bit the question that I was trying to get to.  Obviously, it's very different risk classes.  So the question is, well, really what I was trying to get at from experiencing those different  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:32):**  forms of transition phases, is there already something that you can see, you know, that  is maybe an instrument that we can also apply in agriculture?  I think it's an excellent question.  Just to color it a bit, I think you at Triodos have done a lot of work in the organic space  and the transition to organic.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:10:49):**  And now we're sort of entering the, I think Benedict uses a beautiful term, beyond organic  or beyond farming phase where there's still a lot to figure out and they're not really  clear recipes for farmers that want to go a lot further than the organic space.  How is it for a bank and an investment management company to see that movement happening and  what kind of role can you play there?  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:12):**  What kind of instruments like Benedict do you see already instruments or how would you  approach a few steps in the unknown, basically going beyond organic and farmers like Benedict  but also others that are taking slowly but definitely surely those steps?  Yeah, I think so.  As I touched on the instruments later, but first of all, your question is how do you  
**[0:11:32-0:11:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:32):**  deal as Triodos, indeed, we already from our origination are supportive of the biodynamic  and the organic farming sector.  But we've also launched, so last year we published our new vision on food and agriculture and  on agricultural systems.  We're kind of saying that we need to take next steps and it's not so much of fixing  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:11:57):**  the current system, but really trying to move towards a new and a better food and agricultural  system, which is focused on three pillars.  So one is the balanced ecosystems and I think that definitely includes part of organic,  but where we also say sometimes, let's say the holistic vision that you need to have  on a new system isn't fully covered by an organic certified farmer and sometimes sustainable  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:12:24):**  farmers are not certified organic.  So you need to look beyond that.  To give a bit more background on that vision, we're going to say there are three pillars.  So one is balanced ecosystem, which is very much focused on making sure that agriculture  happens and that we work together with nature instead of against it and actually damaging  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:12:45):**  the natural system that the food system is depending on.  But it's also making sure that, let's say, with a health, that we create a healthy society,  that we create the nutrition that we need and that we really, in that perspective, really  make sure that we produce the right nutrients and that we produce the right food.  And then the third pillar is making sure that everybody in the value chain gets actually  
**[0:13:08-0:13:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:08):**  its fair share and what we then call, it needs to deliver inclusive prosperity and just make  sure that everybody who's active in that value chain actually gets its fair share.  And I think this kind of already shows for us the next step where you can move beyond  organic farming or perhaps go back to the roots of organic farming, which is focused  on multiple important issues, which is ecology, which is also care and its health and safe  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:40):**  and fairness.  And I think not everything that's organically certified actually deals with all four of  the pillars of the organic agriculture.  And that's what we're trying to reflect in the new vision that we published on Food and  Agriculture.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:13:57):**  Yeah, I will definitely link that below so everybody can read it.  Yeah, that would be great.  And it's really a holistic view of how we feel and how we can work to a more resilient  food system.  And as I already mentioned, it needs to deliver healthy nutrition for all without damaging  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:14):**  the natural systems they depend on and make sure that we deliver inclusive prosperity  for those active in the food and agriculture chain.  And I think that's for us what is most important.  And historically, we still strongly support organic.  But we also look at initiatives that go beyond organic, as long as they fit in this sustainable  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:35):**  ecosystem.  But I think that also shows that it's all interrelated.  So when we did the research for this study, we also found that you cannot solve this system  by, for instance, only focusing on fairness.  Because then you also need to look at a balanced ecosystem and you need to make sure that you  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:14:57):**  focus on healthy society.  That's what's necessary to need to be holistic.  So it also means that you cannot solve it independently.  And we are, as Creos, we're now trying to take the next steps based on this vision to  ask such great investable solutions.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:12):**  So for us, the next step is I think it was very important for us to do this research  and to really come to that holistic approach.  And now we're really in the face of translating that into looking at them what's necessary,  but also then and then create investable solutions for our investors.  So depending on their risk and return and impact profile, see like what can you create  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:35):**  in order to attract that money and attract the capital and deploy it in the right direction  to actually make this change happen?  And that's not easy.  So in that sense, also the timing for this podcast for us is also, can also be an inspiration.  And we have a track record.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:15:52):**  We've done this all, indeed, as you mentioned also with organic, and we still do.  So one of the examples that I definitely want to mention is what we're doing within Traders  Bank is that we are giving finance to farmers that are in a transition from conventional  agriculture to organic, where there is this three-year period in which it is not yet organic  certified, but you do already have to live by the organic rules.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:16:18):**  So you do have to incur already higher costs, et cetera, but you don't get the premium.  And that transition, but also the investments that are necessary, that is something that  we, yeah, as Traders Bankers like to try to create a separate facility for that.  And then also the conditions in the transition period are, for instance, that you don't need  to repay the loans, that it's postponed.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:16:44):**  Sometimes also the interest during that period can be part of the finance of the loan itself.  So in that sense, we really try to support that transition.  And we do that because we understand the dynamics in the organic market, and we see what's happening.  So I think we have a clear insight in the risk profile of a farmer when they switch  to organic.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:07):**  And for me, that's the most important thing.  So as a bank or as an investor, it all comes down to knowledge and really understanding  the risks that are involved.  And then hopefully you also have a solution.  It doesn't mean that you always have a solution.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:22):**  But for me, that is the advantage for us as Traders Bankers.  This is what we do.  We only finance organic agriculture.  So we understand that sector, and we want to be supportive.  And it's also the strong task that we've been given by our customers to make sure that their  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:17:37):**  money flows into that direction and supports that transition.  So we're really anxiously working on those solutions.  And I think that's what I was looking back.  And now if you look forward with this vision, what we're now working on is also with partners  to see what can we do to finance transactions in which you purchase the land and perhaps  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:01):**  it's no longer owned by a farmer, but there's an entity in between.  But it is extremely difficult to actually realize that.  But we're also knowing that we have a bank and that we have investment management, but  it's always a certain type of money and either gets an interest or it wants a certain return.  We also have within Triodos, what we call the Triodos Regenerative Money Center, where  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:29):**  we really put all our activities together that are more focused on either gift money  or investments that do not require a high return.  Really try to put that together and what we then call, try to create more Catholic activities.  And so for us as Triodos, it's really the third activity.  So next to the bank and the investments, really the Triodos Regenerative Money Center, where  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:18:56):**  we try to create an activity.  But for us, that's also experimenting and where we try to create something and where  we want to support initiatives that are, as we call them, not yet bankable or not yet  investable, but that do require money.  I think there's a lot to unpack there.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:15):**  Thank you for that.  Benedict, do you want to jump in?  I was going to say that sounds familiar.  Yeah, I mean, I think it's a great approach because I mean, there's just so many unknowns,  right?  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:28):**  Just to give you an example from us, I mean, we are on a very sandy soil.  We have huge problems with drought, especially in spring, early spring, beginning of the  summer.  So that has a huge impact on the profitability, obviously, or being able to harvest something  at all.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:19:46):**  So that being said, let's say the current plot size here are around 40 hectares.  So with that, we have huge problems with erosion, wind erosion, obviously, it's also water erosion,  extreme weather conditions.  The soil is often then very hard, it's not capable of taking up the large sums of water  that are coming.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:05):**  So because of those kind of topics, we have to really think about how we can preserve  the little rain that is falling in the best possible way as a grain oriented or at the  moment still grain oriented agriculture company.  We are very strongly involved in thinking about and obviously also applying agroforestry  ideas, right?  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:29):**  So we have different structures and different, let's say methodologies of agroforestry, one  where we go more into sort of the, let's say the ecological functions that a couple of  rows of agroforestry on a large field can offer, basically by changing the microclimate  between the rows, basically by helping also in the water intake, but having those positive  effects on potential erosion through wind and water.  
**[0:20:53-0:21:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:20:53):**  But then also, in an idea to also think about the potential value add through the tree lines  themselves, right?  So go into a more diverse, more biodiverse system where you have different potentially  nut trees, you have fruit trees, you have fruit bushes, and that's only a start.  You can have a huge variety of different, yeah, let's say fruit bearing trees, I guess,  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:20):**  developing in some sort of product that you can market depending on where you are and  what kind of situation you have.  And especially in Germany, there is not that much research on those kind of multifunctional  land use models.  And specifically when it comes to single trees and then within one species, the different  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:21:44):**  varieties and then combining that with, let's say those very, very harsh conditions that  we have, we often in the year have late frosts danger as well.  So what we're doing in one plot, it's a 3.5 hectare.  We have 19 tree rows.  The area between those two rows is 10 meters.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:02):**  We have planted around 1,700 different trees and bushes.  And these are pretty much the whole variety that I kind of already touched upon.  And there's one row basically to give you an example, which is on plums and berries.  And there we have, for example, 17 different plum varieties because we need to invest the  time now.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:26):**  We need to invest those next, let's say two or three years in order to have a feeling  of which of those varieties can actually cope with the kind of harsh environment that we  are and that will be increasingly we're facing.  So although being convinced that this holds huge potential, especially in an area like  Eastern Brandenburg, we don't know on a, let's say, bankable, responsible basis what the  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:22:54):**  profits could be, what the cost structures will be, what kind of metrics we have to know  and we have to get a feeling for in order to make it a bankable product.  So I think that already shows you quite well how what you just said is very true.  And I think the funny thing is, and this is something where part of the transition or  part of this paradigm shift is going towards also that we are realizing that there's just  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:23:22):**  no silver bullet.  We have to be aware of the complexity of the ecosystem that we're in and we have to be  aware that we have to be able to find solutions that fit into certain contexts at a certain  time and with regard also to the people who are being or running it basically.  So that was a long reply to a fairly easy question, but I think we are at this point,  
**[0:23:51-0:24:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:23:51):**  where we have to do that groundwork and gather data, gather more information and learn more  to then say, okay, from what we've seen, from what we have analyzed, we pretty know what  can work in which kind of environment.  So having that, let's say, regenerative money center, I think is a great and really, really  important first step, I guess.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:19):**  Yeah, and thank you and also for giving some more background.  And I think for me, this also clearly shows that, as you mentioned, there's not one solution  and it's not a clear solution as well.  So it's more entrepreneurial.  That means, unfortunately, what I think is a good development is that there's more and  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:24:40):**  more attention to our agricultural system and also the impact that agriculture has on  climate change.  And I say the impact, but also the fact that it can be part of the solution.  So I think if you look at the European Green Deal that they're kind of working on and also  the fact that they want to plant significant amount of trees, I think for me, agriculture  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:02):**  is should be part of that solution.  And we should not think of climate change.  So it's all linked to each other.  And if you link it, then you can actually also see that there are business models, indeed,  when you talk about agroforestry.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:18):**  Then that's what we're also in contact with some other organizations, for instance, ReWilding  Europe, which is very much focused on how can we make a business model out of creating  nature and especially with the challenges that we're facing when it comes down to climate  change.  You can now see that capital is flowing into a certain direction.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:25:38):**  And what we now need to do is, what I think is very important is that we collect those  efforts and that we also guide them to the direction of agriculture.  And yes, a fair part should go to technology that is already there and that we can scale.  But we also need to make sure that we give that also funds flow to more, let's say, the  pioneers because it is necessary.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:04):**  It's a new pioneering stage.  And I always like the example that within Trials, when there was in the Netherlands,  the first wind turbine on land, and it was very difficult also to get the finance and  the business case.  And then there were several customers of Trials who actually said at that time, well, just  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:24):**  give us a lower interest rate and we're fine with taking a lower interest rate, as long  as you also give a lower interest rate to that wind turbine.  And then all of a sudden, it was possible.  So I think it's that creative thinking and what you're saying.  The challenge that you have is with the soil, and then perhaps a solution is planting more  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:26:45):**  trees with agroforestry.  Then actually, what does it bring?  It also makes sure that you stand out potentially in a retail outlet.  And then hopefully, also consumers are willing to pay a bit more.  And perhaps retailers are willing to make a longer term contract with you as a farmer.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:06):**  And then you need a financial institution who understands that people in the value chain  are thinking differently and are really trying to work together.  And that also lowers the risk.  And then all of a sudden, perhaps it does become bankable.  I think it's a great example of the energy space, that it started with the small wind  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:25):**  turbine on land somewhere, which at the moment, at that time, maybe wasn't bankable.  And in your understanding of the bank space, what are the timelines we have to think about?  Because it's clearly that we're in a pioneering space.  And it's clearly that Benedict and many others are literally finding out what works and what  doesn't.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:27:45):**  And Benedict says, maybe in a few years, in two, three years, we have a better understanding  which plums and which trees, et cetera.  But for a bank, how long did it take for organic to be bankable or for solar to be bankable  and what kind of years are we thinking about?  Is that five years of records or 10 or maybe even 15 before it becomes easy for obviously  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:03):**  a very structured and regulated entity like a bank?  That's a difficult question, Koen.  Yeah, and not easy to answer.  And I think that what's most important is that, so my heart would like to say, you have  a good plan, work together with partners and then come to a bank and then make sure that  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:26):**  they understand.  And then it should be bankable.  But indeed, I think you need to think about a timeframe of, let's say, three to five years.  But that's a bit pessimistic.  So hopefully, it can be somewhere in the middle.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:38):**  Well, we want the honest answer.  What's the banker saying?  What is your banker mind?  Because many, I think many people listening don't have the luxury to have a trios within  their reach.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:28:51):**  They can check the Global Alliance on banking on values, but they would have a more traditional  bank.  So they would have to face this more, maybe more pessimistic or less knowledgeable person  on agriculture, future of agriculture.  To not give them too much hope, you would say three to five and maybe even a bit more  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:07):**  than that.  Yeah, no, but I think, I mean, you need one or two years of track record.  So you need a pioneering phase.  And then you need one or two years where you actually show that it works.  Let's say that's more in general.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:21):**  And then in the pioneering phase, you might be able to do it earlier.  But if you talk about scale, and I think that's it.  So we shouldn't, I think this is a great example, your firm, Benedict, but it's also, I mean,  financing one project, it's always possible.  So that the banker says, well, we're going to do it anyway, because we want to finance  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:29:42):**  that pioneer.  But I think if you talk about scale, it needs to be something that indeed is proven.  And then indeed, you're talking, I would say three to five years.  And also, if you look at the renewable energy market, as it took several years to really  become mature, and then all of a sudden, and now you see lots of capital flowing in already  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:02):**  for several years.  So I think for the upcoming two to three years, you are still stuck in the pioneering phase  and you need pioneers and either, and then, yeah.  So pioneering capital and more risk capital.  And then I would say like three to five years, what you need before it's really on a bigger  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:27):**  scale, it's bankable.  And it's also then becomes an asset class that's attractive for other banks as well,  beyond the impact investment space.  Yeah, I think the question really is how can you make it like an asset class that is sort  of understood by everyone and accepted with a certain risk profile.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:30:48):**  And the question is, how do we get there?  And I think from our experience as well, I think it's really about having those examples,  having farmers in different zones and different problems with different, maybe also let's  say focus and having them as let's say pioneers show what they're doing, how they're doing  it, what kind of problems they face, how they find solutions and basically support them  
**[0:31:20-0:31:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:31:20):**  because politicians, the public, consumers, other farmers, all of them, they need to go  to those places, to the farmers, speak to the farmer.  They have to see at those new ways.  They have to touch them.  They have to experience them.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:31:36):**  I think only through experiences can people who are not connected as strongly into those  things understand and build a sort of interest, possibly love to then say, okay, I mean, in  my role, I can do something towards the move and the change to help that kind of new paradigm  of agriculture basically to get a strong foothold and to get a better price, to be more open  and the whole trading scheme and so forth.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:06):**  So I think it's a really important step to find people that already are trying to do  those kinds of things and then put them in the spotlight, I guess.  And I think it also goes down to trust.  So indeed, when you look at it from a consumer perspective, and so one of our portfolio companies  of the Treaters Organic Growth Fund is a company called Allstead and that's a meal box company  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:31):**  from Denmark.  And so what they really, they source from Denmark, but also from other countries in  Europe, organic fruit and vegetables, put it in a box together with other ingredients  to prepare, let's say, a healthy and sustainable meal at your home, so you can make it yourself.  But this is an organization that's now also trusted by their customers and knowing that  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:32:57):**  if you buy over there, it might be, it's organic food and vegetables and it might be more expensive  than conventional, but at least you know that they have a long-term relationship with their  suppliers.  And then you're potentially also willing to pay a bit more because you trust them.  And I think we've somehow built a very efficient food system, which was necessary because we  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:20):**  really focused on making sure that everybody had sufficient nutrients and sufficient food  available.  And that's, of course, still a challenge, but I think now times are changing and we  need to create a structure in which there's, yeah, there's trust in the system and everybody  gets this fair share.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:33:39):**  And then also consumers are, I think they're not unwilling to pay a bit more, but then  what for them is what needs to be crystal clear is that if they pay a bit more, that  that also goes to the farmers actually.  And so for me, it's really building the trust and making it, and now somehow what you also  mentioned, Benedict, it's now an anonymous food system.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:04):**  And indeed what you're saying, if you open up your farm, then the people reconnect and  they really see the value of food instead of trying to buy it as cheap as possible.  I was just going to ask a final question.  I wanted to be conscious of your time.  Usually these final questions turn into a few more, but what would be your advice, Julian,  
**[0:34:24-0:34:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:24):**  to, I think the advice of Benedict is clear.  Go to your farmer, talk, understand, taste, touch, understand the food system, understand  these pioneers much more.  What would be your advice to investors listening to the space?  Maybe people working in the finance sector, so your colleagues or competitors, but let's  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:34:41):**  say farmers listening to that are maybe pioneering here.  What would be your advice that in five to 10 years, this will be a bankable asset class  that we can all participate in?  What should they do tomorrow or today if they serve a full day?  Yeah, as already mentioned, we always look at it from a risk return and impact perspective.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:04):**  And I would say it's a first step for now in this pioneering phase.  You need to get it crystal clear what the risks are, which are obviously higher, what  the returns are, which is definitely challenging, and what the impact is.  And make that also clear.  And I think if you have that clarity, you can find funds or people or organizations  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:28):**  that where this impact risk return profile actually matches with what they're looking  for.  But also have a clear strategy on indeed how do you make this scalable?  So what's your goal?  How do you feel that in the end, you can turn this into a wider movement instead of what's  
**[0:35:47-0:35:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:35:47):**  next beyond the pioneering phase?  But I think for now, we need all brainpower to really think about, as already mentioned,  the impact risk and return of this project.  And also from the traditional finance sector, from consumers, and from large food companies.  Collect all of that.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:13):**  Understand that potentially not everybody can for now help, but at least involve them  and make them ready for the next step.  And that they understand so that the moment you want to reach more scale, they better  understand the risk that they're getting into, and also the return and the impact that they're  able to make.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:32):**  Maybe also one question from my side.  I had the honor to moderate a panel on regenerative agriculture at the Farm and Food 4.0, which  is always a very well known conference on innovation in agriculture, specifically in  startups, ag tech, but also this year regenerative agriculture.  And we spoke about the topic also, do we really have the time?  
**[0:36:58-0:37:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:36:58):**  And can we afford as a society, as farmers, as consumers, as people to wait until we are  able to satisfactorily take the next step?  And often, Indigo obviously is one of those companies that are at the forefront of articulating  the whole potential of CO2 intake.  This is something, I'm sure, you mentioned briefly as well.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:37:24):**  In my view, only speaking about sequestering carbon and then having a vehicle, so to say,  that pays the farmer, that's again not taking care of the complexity of the ecosystem, I  think.  So we have to look at it more holistically.  And if we agree on that, and I think we do, don't we, as of now, actually have to start  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:37:48):**  much stronger discussion on the whole concept of true cost accounting and say, look, if  you're a farmer in an arid region, if you're a farmer where you have great potential yields,  don't we have to find a holistic management or let's say measurement tool to say, okay,  there's different ways a farmer is contributing, either through high production of grain or  a large potential to sequester carbon or a huge, let's say, potential for increasing  
**[0:38:22-0:38:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:38:22):**  biodiversity and so forth.  And don't we have to think about that so much stronger to see how can we facilitate the  change of farmers much quicker?  Because after the panel, there was farmers approaching people at the Farm and Food and  said, look, we want to change.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:38:40):**  We have x, y, z hectares, but we don't actually have all of the skill set that we need.  We don't have the right machines yet.  We don't have the finance to, let's say, cover a year of maybe three, four, five, six, seven  years where you will go through a bit of a dip, obviously.  What can we do?  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:02):**  And isn't that the kind of question that we have to ask ourselves?  How can we find an innovative, holistic tool of financing those transitions?  Also a paradigm shift in how we think about finance, if you want.  I know that's a bit of a weird question, but do you know what I'm trying to get at, Jeroen?  Yeah, I think so.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:27):**  And I think I definitely agree.  So you need to have, I think in the end, that's also where we should be heading to.  And as you also mentioned, we have no time to waste.  And I also think that this holistic system, it can be a significant step.  And then, of course, the question is, will we be able to take that leap?  
**[0:39:49-0:39:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:39:49):**  So for me, it also, again, starts with pioneers and just starting small.  And starting small while not forgetting about the bigger picture and constantly thinking,  like, can we already scale it?  What do we additional need?  Perhaps potentially what type of larger corporations are out there who will be willing to support  
**[0:40:09-0:40:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:09):**  this?  But I definitely agree.  I mean, in the end, and that's also what our vision is about.  It is about this holistic change.  It's not just paying a bit more for your veggies in the supermarket so that the farmer gets  
**[0:40:27-0:40:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:27):**  a bit more income.  Now, it's really about really changing, eating more local, shifting a diet, circular agriculture,  agroforestry.  It all needs to be included, but it's also extremely complex.  And that's why I always like this combination of, yes, we need to think about an holistic  
**[0:40:47-0:40:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:40:47):**  system.  And we also need to, yesterday, start working on a solution, which is just the first step.  Yeah, I think we're opening, we're moving into a whole new discussion, which I think  we need to have, but not this time on the podcast.  I think that should be another one.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:05):**  I feel the tension constantly of we need to move yesterday as much as possible.  And obviously, I also see the potential issues or the challenges that institutions have because  they're not investing their own money.  And at the same time, I hear you, Benedict, like we need a couple of years to figure out  which plums we actually need to plant.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:25):**  But of course, you would love to already know that and plant them everywhere in the right  mix.  So there's this constant tension of going very fast.  And at the same time, we somehow cannot go faster than certain principles are.  So I think it's one of the reasons we're recording this.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:41):**  And one of the reasons I'm so happy you, Jurijen, came on the first official episode with a  guest of the Transition Finance series.  I want to thank you both again for so much to join and also the whole team at Triodos  to make this happen.  And I don't think it's the last time we are discussing and we're sharing on Transition  
**[0:41:59-0:42:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:41:59):**  Finance and regenerative agriculture and food systems.  Yeah, thank you.  And again, thank you for having me and having this opportunity to discuss this with you,  Koen, and with Benedict.  And well, be continued.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:42:13):**  Yeah, very much looking forward to this discussion.  And yeah, I mean, Triodos is at the forefront of this development.  So all eyes are on you guys.  No pressure, but no pressure.  We can only solve it together.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/10/transition-finance-ep2/#t=0:42:26):**  And I think you guys are doing a great job.  So awesome to have you on board as well.

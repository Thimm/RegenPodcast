### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 02:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to another interview. This is a short interview with Andri Vojtse, head of Business  
**[0:00:04-0:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:04):**  and Government Solutions at Soil Capital. He wrote a LinkedIn post, Europe has defined  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:09):**  green business for investors. But what does this mean for regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:15):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:20):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:24):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:29-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:29):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:35):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration? Because so many of the pressing issues we  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:39):**  face today have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat. And  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:44):**  it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:53):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:57):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month. But at the same  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:02):**  time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there are many more stories  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:06):**  to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more depth, improve the quality,  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:12):**  maybe even doing some video series. So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:17):**  support creators like myself. If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:21):**  the means, I invite you to support me and make this happen. For more information please  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:26):**  find a link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:31):**  And now without further ado, the interview. Enjoy!  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:35):**  Welcome Andrew.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:36):**  Thanks Koen, good to be here.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:38):**  So could you give a bit of context to what this taxonomy on green business for investors  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:43):**  means and why this is so important for impact investors?  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:46):**  Certainly. So in the last few weeks the European Union has published the so-called sustainable  
**[0:01:52-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:52):**  taxonomy or taxonomy for short. And what this is, is effectively a classification tool to  
**[0:02:00-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:02:00):**  help investors and companies in the real economy identify business activities that can be deemed  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:02:08):**  environmentally friendly. It's probably worth giving some context to where this has come  
**[0:02:14-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:02:14):**  from so that listeners understand where this could go. So several years ago, the parts  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:02:22):**  of the European Commission and the European Union that look at financial stability, financial  
**[0:02:28-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:02:28):**  markets and the integration of our capital markets started to engage in a process of  
**[0:02:35-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:02:35):**  deep reform that was intended to align the financial system with the needs of a sustainable  
**[0:02:46-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:02:46):**  real economy. They assembled a large team of financial market and other experts which  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:02:55):**  provided them with recommendations on what they should do. This is the European Commission  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:02:59):**  assembling this team. And probably six or nine months ago they published a formal response  
**[0:03:05-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:03:05):**  to that, a set of actions which was broad and ambitious, covered a whole range of different  
**[0:03:12-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:03:12):**  topics. But one of those and the one that has been moved on most quickly is this taxonomy.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:03:20):**  And really the problem that the Commission is trying to solve here is that investors  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:03:25):**  of all shapes and sizes, other capital providers, financial regulators and companies that they  
**[0:03:32-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:03:32):**  invest in or lend to, don't have a shared set of detailed definitions for what constitutes  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:03:42):**  environmentally friendly business. They have broad policy directions set by governments  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:03:49):**  but they don't have something that translates those policy directions into, if you like,  
**[0:03:55-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:03:55):**  acceptable details. And so the search costs and the due diligence costs reported by all  
**[0:04:03-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:04:03):**  sorts of capital providers are seen as being too high. So this taxonomy is an attempt to  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:04:11):**  address that problem. As I say, it's coming out of the parts of the European Union that  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:04:18):**  deal with financial markets which is one of the reasons I think this is significant. And  
**[0:04:24-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:04:24):**  ultimately the intention of the taxonomy is to provide a tool that people can use when  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:04:34):**  they're designing financial products to try to target green businesses. It's a tool that  
**[0:04:39-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:04:39):**  will be used to shape disclosure requirements by investors and it's a tool that I think  
**[0:04:47-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:04:47):**  in time we will see standard setters and regulators of different varieties integrate into their  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:04:55):**  own practices as well.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:04:57):**  And the interesting piece is I think it's absolutely key for investors obviously operating  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:05:02):**  in the EU and the European Union because you're going to deal with this left or right. If  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:05:07):**  you're making investment in a fund, in a company, if you're looking at certain things you're  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:05:11):**  going to see this over the next years as a tool just like we see the SDGs who are not  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:05:15):**  really an investment approach but you see them popping up everywhere as a sort of shared  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:05:20):**  language. Why does it also matter for non-European investors or investors that are not investing  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:05:25):**  in the European Union?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:05:26):**  Yeah, it's a good point, Kun. I think the answer to that is that the problem that the  
**[0:05:34-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:05:34):**  taxonomy seeks to solve is I think a problem that is recognized outside of Europe to different  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:05:43):**  degrees but in markets around the world. And anecdotally I've already seen some evidence  
**[0:05:49-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:05:49):**  of interested parties from around the world look at what Europe is doing because to some  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:05:57):**  extent it's getting ahead and solving some of the problems that they too face. So I think  
**[0:06:03-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:06:03):**  over the next months and years it's not ridiculous to imagine that there'll be a degree of close  
**[0:06:11-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:06:11):**  scrutiny of this European taxonomy by others who are looking for say shortcuts to solving  
**[0:06:19-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:06:19):**  similar problems that they face themselves. So I think we may see this taxonomy starting  
**[0:06:26-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:06:26):**  to set some sort of global standard even if informally and if the links between what happens  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:06:34):**  in Europe and other parts of the world not being super visible to all of us.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:06:39):**  So you're basically saying it might serve as an inspiration and a very clear blueprint  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:06:44):**  if this is successful for other major regions in the world that are looking at fixing their  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:06:51):**  financial system and the connection to the real economy.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:06:54):**  I think so. I wouldn't want to overstate that because you can never predict these relationships.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:00):**  We hope.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:01):**  Well I think there's enough reason to expect that that could happen and that's why I think  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:06):**  we all need to take quite careful place with a lot of attention on what's happening with  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:11):**  this taxonomy because there's a moment coming up where we can all now engage with it. So  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:17):**  it's important we get it right.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:19):**  Yeah now let's dive into it because there's an important piece on RegenEgg actually and  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:24):**  it's mainly focused as a background it's mainly focused on emissions and they actually also  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:29):**  mentioned the carbon farming and the carbon sequestration part or potential of it which  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:34):**  is I think very very interesting. Could you give us very short because it's a huge document  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:39):**  obviously a summary of what are the key points in terms of RegenEgg that we as investors  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:45):**  in the space should know about. Some of your surprises actually because you've been part  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:49):**  of the process for it but it's quite radical in some cases.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:52):**  No it is. The detail of what is said on agriculture is another reason I think this is such an  
**[0:07:57-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:57):**  important discussion to be having. To be clear when the group of experts that was developing  
**[0:08:04-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:08:04):**  the taxonomy started its work it was focused on defining green and environmentally beneficial  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:08:12):**  agriculture broadly. That scope was then focused on climate change mitigation and adaptation  
**[0:08:19-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:08:19):**  specifically while ensuring that the definitions that were produced don't undermine other  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:08:27):**  objectives like the preservation of water resources, pollution prevention, healthy  
**[0:08:32-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:08:32):**  ecosystems and so on. I think there are three things that strike me about what has been  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:08:40):**  produced for the regenerative agriculture community. The first is that the taxonomy  
**[0:08:47-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:08:47):**  quite explicitly acknowledges what many of us know that agriculture can transition from  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:08:57):**  being quite a substantial part of the climate problem to being quite a substantial part  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:09:02):**  of the solution. That's not a surprise to most of us but it is important I think to  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:09:08):**  see that reflected in a taxonomy coming out of the financial markets division of the European  
**[0:09:14-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:09:14):**  Union. The second thing which I find striking is that at the heart of understanding how  
**[0:09:22-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:09:22):**  that transition works and how it should be measured and monitored soil health is really  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:09:31):**  brought out as the North Star if you like. Again that's not a surprise to any of us  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:09:37):**  but I think it's for the same reason quite heartening to see it in this taxonomy.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:09:43):**  And then thirdly you mentioned some of the processes and the practices that are mentioned.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:09:49):**  The taxonomy acknowledges that there are two ways to measure progress towards agriculture  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:09:58):**  that is considered compliant with the taxonomy. One is to measure outcomes in terms of both  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:10:03):**  carbon emissions and carbon sequestration but the other is to measure the implementation  
**[0:10:08-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:10:08):**  of practices and the taxonomy articulates what it believes those practices are going  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:10:16):**  to need to be. And I think when you look at the detail of those practices you see quite  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:10:22):**  a close alignment with what the regenerative agriculture community is already practicing.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:10:28):**  So you have things like more diverse, more complex crop rotations, the use of cover crops  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:10:35):**  but not monoculture cover crops, multi-species cover crops.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:10:38):**  Even an amount of cover crops right? And at least one legume. They're very specific and  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:10:44):**  very specific on what they want to see.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:10:48):**  That's right and I'm sure the approach to prescribing practices not least prescribing  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:10:53):**  quite ambitious practices will trigger debate to say the least.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:10:58):**  But I think the point that comes through is that this quite broad group of experts, I  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:02):**  think over 200 experts were selected to contribute to the taxonomy development overall.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:08):**  They've identified here some practical but high ambition regenerative practices to find  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:16):**  what good looks like.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:18):**  And just the fact that they did that and have the process and the outcome base I think they're  
**[0:11:22-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:22):**  even both in there but probably they will start mostly with the process part is very  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:28):**  very interesting without losing the holistic approach.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:33):**  Yeah and that's a detail actually that I also think is quite significant. You sometimes  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:36):**  see in these this type of work that individual farming practices for example you know no  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:43):**  or minimum till would count as being eligible on its own.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:47):**  What you see in the taxonomy is more of a systemic approach where bundles of practices  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:53):**  in their language are required to be compliant with the taxonomy.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:58):**  And I think that is an attempt to recognize a as you say more holistic more systems orientated  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:05):**  approach to agriculture.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:07):**  And for people that are not familiar with the process, not the process of RegenAg but  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:11):**  the process of taxonomy and European business, where are we now and what's happening over  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:18):**  the next months?  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:19):**  And you mentioned actually people can be involved at some point.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:22):**  What's the potential for people listening to this to actively participate, to help push,  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:26):**  to support or not or to discuss what's happening over the next months?  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:31):**  It's a really good point because I think this is an extremely timely conversation because  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:34):**  now really is the time when people can engage.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:38):**  So just to give a bit of context, the arriving at this point has taken months and years of  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:47):**  work by appointed experts.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:50):**  There was an open application process for those experts for the latest contribution  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:55):**  and the publication of the taxonomy in the last few weeks is the result of their work.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:13:01):**  What's now being announced in the last few days is a public consultation process that  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:13:07):**  runs until the 13th of September.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:13:10):**  So just over a couple of months which really focuses the mind and is an opportunity for  
**[0:13:19-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:13:19):**  farmers, for food brands, for investors and lenders and people with all sorts of expertise  
**[0:13:26-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:13:26):**  really to make sure that this taxonomy is setting ambition at the right level, is as  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:13:33):**  practical as possible and ultimately does help to serve its purpose of directing capital  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:13:39):**  towards the best type of agriculture we can build.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:13:45):**  So that process of engagement is open now.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:13:48):**  We at Soil Capital are doing what we can to help people understand the taxonomy as we  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:13:54):**  see it and therefore how they can engage.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:13:58):**  I think there will have to be one more consultation process before the taxonomy is ultimately  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:03):**  adopted into European law but I'd encourage people to focus on the one that's open now.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:09):**  And how can they engage?  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:11):**  Basically through European Union website or are there specific questions?  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:16):**  What's the process like?  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:17):**  Yeah there is a website with specific questions.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:21):**  It's quite a structured process which actually I think helps respondents to target their  
**[0:14:28-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:28):**  feedback quite well.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:29):**  So maybe we can share the link in the notes under the podcast so that people can look  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:34):**  at that.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:35):**  That would be good and if they have any specific questions they can reach out to you as well  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:39):**  to see, I mean as you have studied this one for quite a long time and have been involved  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:43):**  in it, it's always good to see your view on it.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:46):**  Yeah of course we're happy to help where we can.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:48):**  As you say I think it's a digestion job to wade through the documentation and understand  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:55):**  where the really crucial parts are.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:57):**  So happy to help on that as we can.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:15:00):**  Perfect.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:15:01):**  I think we can spend hours on diving in all the details in the process versus outcome  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:15:05):**  based etc. but this is such a timely matter.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:15:08):**  I wanted and I think we succeeded in keeping it short and making sure we get this out before  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:15:15):**  the consultation closes which is on the 13th of September.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:15:18):**  So I want to thank you for your time, thank you for your work in this space and I will  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:15:22):**  definitely link the LinkedIn post you wrote which goes into much more detail and also  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:15:27):**  the list of questions and how people can engage with this round.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:15:31):**  Thanks Kun, keep up the great work shining a light on these important discussions.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:15:34):**  So crucial.

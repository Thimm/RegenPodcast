### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2019-07-19)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to another interview. This is a short interview with Andri Vojtse, head of Business  and Government Solutions at Soil Capital. He wrote a LinkedIn post, Europe has defined  green business for investors. But what does this mean for regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:15):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:29-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:29):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration? Because so many of the pressing issues we  face today have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat. And  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:44):**  it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:00:57):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month. But at the same  time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there are many more stories  to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more depth, improve the quality,  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:12):**  maybe even doing some video series. So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to  support creators like myself. If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have  the means, I invite you to support me and make this happen. For more information please  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:26):**  find a link to my Patreon account in the description below.  And now without further ado, the interview. Enjoy!  Welcome Andrew.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:36):**  Thanks Koen, good to be here.  So could you give a bit of context to what this taxonomy on green business for investors  means and why this is so important for impact investors?  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:01:46):**  Certainly. So in the last few weeks the European Union has published the so-called sustainable  taxonomy or taxonomy for short. And what this is, is effectively a classification tool to  help investors and companies in the real economy identify business activities that can be deemed  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:02:08):**  environmentally friendly. It's probably worth giving some context to where this has come  from so that listeners understand where this could go. So several years ago, the parts  of the European Commission and the European Union that look at financial stability, financial  
**[0:02:28-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:02:28):**  markets and the integration of our capital markets started to engage in a process of  deep reform that was intended to align the financial system with the needs of a sustainable  real economy. They assembled a large team of financial market and other experts which  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:02:55):**  provided them with recommendations on what they should do. This is the European Commission  assembling this team. And probably six or nine months ago they published a formal response  to that, a set of actions which was broad and ambitious, covered a whole range of different  
**[0:03:12-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:03:12):**  topics. But one of those and the one that has been moved on most quickly is this taxonomy.  And really the problem that the Commission is trying to solve here is that investors  of all shapes and sizes, other capital providers, financial regulators and companies that they  
**[0:03:32-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:03:32):**  invest in or lend to, don't have a shared set of detailed definitions for what constitutes  environmentally friendly business. They have broad policy directions set by governments  but they don't have something that translates those policy directions into, if you like,  
**[0:03:55-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:03:55):**  acceptable details. And so the search costs and the due diligence costs reported by all  sorts of capital providers are seen as being too high. So this taxonomy is an attempt to  address that problem. As I say, it's coming out of the parts of the European Union that  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:04:18):**  deal with financial markets which is one of the reasons I think this is significant. And  ultimately the intention of the taxonomy is to provide a tool that people can use when  they're designing financial products to try to target green businesses. It's a tool that  
**[0:04:39-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:04:39):**  will be used to shape disclosure requirements by investors and it's a tool that I think  in time we will see standard setters and regulators of different varieties integrate into their  own practices as well.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:04:57):**  And the interesting piece is I think it's absolutely key for investors obviously operating  in the EU and the European Union because you're going to deal with this left or right. If  you're making investment in a fund, in a company, if you're looking at certain things you're  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:05:11):**  going to see this over the next years as a tool just like we see the SDGs who are not  really an investment approach but you see them popping up everywhere as a sort of shared  language. Why does it also matter for non-European investors or investors that are not investing  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:05:25):**  in the European Union?  Yeah, it's a good point, Kun. I think the answer to that is that the problem that the  taxonomy seeks to solve is I think a problem that is recognized outside of Europe to different  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:05:43):**  degrees but in markets around the world. And anecdotally I've already seen some evidence  of interested parties from around the world look at what Europe is doing because to some  extent it's getting ahead and solving some of the problems that they too face. So I think  
**[0:06:03-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:06:03):**  over the next months and years it's not ridiculous to imagine that there'll be a degree of close  scrutiny of this European taxonomy by others who are looking for say shortcuts to solving  similar problems that they face themselves. So I think we may see this taxonomy starting  
**[0:06:26-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:06:26):**  to set some sort of global standard even if informally and if the links between what happens  in Europe and other parts of the world not being super visible to all of us.  So you're basically saying it might serve as an inspiration and a very clear blueprint  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:06:44):**  if this is successful for other major regions in the world that are looking at fixing their  financial system and the connection to the real economy.  I think so. I wouldn't want to overstate that because you can never predict these relationships.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:00):**  We hope.  Well I think there's enough reason to expect that that could happen and that's why I think  we all need to take quite careful place with a lot of attention on what's happening with  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:11):**  this taxonomy because there's a moment coming up where we can all now engage with it. So  it's important we get it right.  Yeah now let's dive into it because there's an important piece on RegenEgg actually and  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:24):**  it's mainly focused as a background it's mainly focused on emissions and they actually also  mentioned the carbon farming and the carbon sequestration part or potential of it which  is I think very very interesting. Could you give us very short because it's a huge document  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:39):**  obviously a summary of what are the key points in terms of RegenEgg that we as investors  in the space should know about. Some of your surprises actually because you've been part  of the process for it but it's quite radical in some cases.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:07:52):**  No it is. The detail of what is said on agriculture is another reason I think this is such an  important discussion to be having. To be clear when the group of experts that was developing  the taxonomy started its work it was focused on defining green and environmentally beneficial  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:08:12):**  agriculture broadly. That scope was then focused on climate change mitigation and adaptation  specifically while ensuring that the definitions that were produced don't undermine other  objectives like the preservation of water resources, pollution prevention, healthy  
**[0:08:32-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:08:32):**  ecosystems and so on. I think there are three things that strike me about what has been  produced for the regenerative agriculture community. The first is that the taxonomy  quite explicitly acknowledges what many of us know that agriculture can transition from  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:08:57):**  being quite a substantial part of the climate problem to being quite a substantial part  of the solution. That's not a surprise to most of us but it is important I think to  see that reflected in a taxonomy coming out of the financial markets division of the European  
**[0:09:14-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:09:14):**  Union. The second thing which I find striking is that at the heart of understanding how  that transition works and how it should be measured and monitored soil health is really  brought out as the North Star if you like. Again that's not a surprise to any of us  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:09:37):**  but I think it's for the same reason quite heartening to see it in this taxonomy.  And then thirdly you mentioned some of the processes and the practices that are mentioned.  The taxonomy acknowledges that there are two ways to measure progress towards agriculture  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:09:58):**  that is considered compliant with the taxonomy. One is to measure outcomes in terms of both  carbon emissions and carbon sequestration but the other is to measure the implementation  of practices and the taxonomy articulates what it believes those practices are going  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:10:16):**  to need to be. And I think when you look at the detail of those practices you see quite  a close alignment with what the regenerative agriculture community is already practicing.  So you have things like more diverse, more complex crop rotations, the use of cover crops  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:10:35):**  but not monoculture cover crops, multi-species cover crops.  Even an amount of cover crops right? And at least one legume. They're very specific and  very specific on what they want to see.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:10:48):**  That's right and I'm sure the approach to prescribing practices not least prescribing  quite ambitious practices will trigger debate to say the least.  But I think the point that comes through is that this quite broad group of experts, I  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:02):**  think over 200 experts were selected to contribute to the taxonomy development overall.  They've identified here some practical but high ambition regenerative practices to find  what good looks like.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:18):**  And just the fact that they did that and have the process and the outcome base I think they're  even both in there but probably they will start mostly with the process part is very  very interesting without losing the holistic approach.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:33):**  Yeah and that's a detail actually that I also think is quite significant. You sometimes  see in these this type of work that individual farming practices for example you know no  or minimum till would count as being eligible on its own.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:11:47):**  What you see in the taxonomy is more of a systemic approach where bundles of practices  in their language are required to be compliant with the taxonomy.  And I think that is an attempt to recognize a as you say more holistic more systems orientated  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:05):**  approach to agriculture.  And for people that are not familiar with the process, not the process of RegenAg but  the process of taxonomy and European business, where are we now and what's happening over  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:18):**  the next months?  And you mentioned actually people can be involved at some point.  What's the potential for people listening to this to actively participate, to help push,  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:26):**  to support or not or to discuss what's happening over the next months?  It's a really good point because I think this is an extremely timely conversation because  now really is the time when people can engage.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:38):**  So just to give a bit of context, the arriving at this point has taken months and years of  work by appointed experts.  There was an open application process for those experts for the latest contribution  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:12:55):**  and the publication of the taxonomy in the last few weeks is the result of their work.  What's now being announced in the last few days is a public consultation process that  runs until the 13th of September.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:13:10):**  So just over a couple of months which really focuses the mind and is an opportunity for  farmers, for food brands, for investors and lenders and people with all sorts of expertise  really to make sure that this taxonomy is setting ambition at the right level, is as  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:13:33):**  practical as possible and ultimately does help to serve its purpose of directing capital  towards the best type of agriculture we can build.  So that process of engagement is open now.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:13:48):**  We at Soil Capital are doing what we can to help people understand the taxonomy as we  see it and therefore how they can engage.  I think there will have to be one more consultation process before the taxonomy is ultimately  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:03):**  adopted into European law but I'd encourage people to focus on the one that's open now.  And how can they engage?  Basically through European Union website or are there specific questions?  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:16):**  What's the process like?  Yeah there is a website with specific questions.  It's quite a structured process which actually I think helps respondents to target their  
**[0:14:28-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:28):**  feedback quite well.  So maybe we can share the link in the notes under the podcast so that people can look  at that.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:35):**  That would be good and if they have any specific questions they can reach out to you as well  to see, I mean as you have studied this one for quite a long time and have been involved  in it, it's always good to see your view on it.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:46):**  Yeah of course we're happy to help where we can.  As you say I think it's a digestion job to wade through the documentation and understand  where the really crucial parts are.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:14:57):**  So happy to help on that as we can.  Perfect.  I think we can spend hours on diving in all the details in the process versus outcome  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:15:05):**  based etc. but this is such a timely matter.  I wanted and I think we succeeded in keeping it short and making sure we get this out before  the consultation closes which is on the 13th of September.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:15:18):**  So I want to thank you for your time, thank you for your work in this space and I will  definitely link the LinkedIn post you wrote which goes into much more detail and also  the list of questions and how people can engage with this round.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/22/andrew-voysey/#t=0:15:31):**  Thanks Kun, keep up the great work shining a light on these important discussions.  So crucial.  Thank you so much.

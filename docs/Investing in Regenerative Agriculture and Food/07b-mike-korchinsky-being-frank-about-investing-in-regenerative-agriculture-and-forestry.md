**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:00:20):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:00:21):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:00:31):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:00:44):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:00:54):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:00:58):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:01:02):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:01:06):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:01:10):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:01:15):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:01:19):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:01:24):**  support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:01:26):**  For more information please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:01:31):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:01:38):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:41-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:01:41):**  I interviewed Mike Korczynski of Wildlife Works a couple of months ago and we had a  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:01:44):**  long discussion on regenerative agriculture and how to work with indigenous groups and  
**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:01:49):**  communities in Congo and Kenya.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:01:52):**  But only the last 15 minutes we got into the role of impact investing in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:01:57):**  And I feel like that part in itself as a standalone podcast has a lot of value and interesting  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:02):**  insights.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:04):**  So that's why I wanted to share it with you, not only as part of the full interview which  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:07):**  I will link below, but also as a standalone podcast of about 17 minutes.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:12):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:02:13-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:13):**  What do you see as the most important barriers to scale up these small pilots or small examples  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:21):**  of what's actually possible?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:22):**  What is needed to scale up those to actually reach the impact we all need?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:28):**  Well, you know, let me look at the clock here.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:35):**  Just a sec.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:36):**  No, I can see how much time.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:37):**  You know, I think one of my pet peeves is having come from the business community and  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:44):**  having worked to try and find an economic solution for our work as well as for wildlife  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:49):**  and forests around the world for 20 years, I've seen lots of ideas come and go and fads  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:55):**  and things.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:02:56):**  And one of the things that drives me nuts is the direction that the impact investment  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:00):**  community has taken.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:03):**  And I mean, you know, it's understandable.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:07):**  These are investors.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:08):**  And so for the most part, you don't start an impact investment community with activists  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:15):**  because they don't have any money to invest.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:17):**  You start an impact investment community with investors.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:21):**  And so yes, of course, those are investors that have a desire to be part of the solution.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:26):**  So they're nice investors, but they're investors.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:29):**  And those investors have choices in how they invest their money.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:34):**  And they want to make sure that their own fortune is sustainable so they can continue  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:37):**  to invest.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:38):**  So that's their first priority and maybe rightly so.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:42):**  Otherwise, their role as an investor will diminish over time and disappear.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:47):**  So the impact investment community, the activists and I don't know who else, the creative folks  
**[0:03:53-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:03:53):**  that wanted to divert investments away from unsustainable investments towards impact investments  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:03):**  have created a storyline which is, in my opinion, very potentially very threatening to the success  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:10):**  in the future.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:11):**  That story is that, gee, you know, impact investments can have all the returns of a  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:17):**  traditional financial investment plus these other bottom lines, plus social benefits and  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:22):**  biodiversity benefits.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:23):**  So look, you don't have to give up anything economically and you get the benefit of doing  
**[0:04:29-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:29):**  something great for the planet.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:30):**  Who would not put their money into that?  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:33):**  And so that's been the story in many conferences all over the world for many years now.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:38):**  And so those well-intentioned investors have all said, yeah, absolutely, who would not  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:42):**  do that?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:43):**  Let's put our money there.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:45):**  And so they all put vast amounts of money, you know, really into this impact investing  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:50):**  field in fund after fund after fund.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:04:55):**  And then the fund managers go out in the world looking for these deals that have the exact  
**[0:05:01-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:05:01):**  same return as they would get in a traditional investment and social benefit and biodiversity  
**[0:05:10-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:05:10):**  benefit.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:05:11):**  And they can't find them.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:05:14):**  So because it actually costs more money to do business in weird places where you're trying  
**[0:05:18-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:05:18):**  to provide economic solutions for small villages and rural communities a long way from a market.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:05:25):**  And so these things cost more money and have a much higher risk profile.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:05:29):**  And therefore, they will not, they will need for an investor to be able to demonstrate  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:05:35):**  a higher return for the investor to be interested or the investor has to be willing to offset  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:05:42):**  their financial return with the social and biodiversity return.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:05:47):**  And to this point, the story that's been sold to them is that they don't have to make that  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:05:50):**  compromise and that's damaging because it means the money is not really flowing into  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:05:54):**  true impact investments.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:05:56):**  It means that eventually, because they were sold on the idea and they made the decision  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:06:00):**  to move money based on the idea that they would get a similar return, in the end, the  
**[0:06:04-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:06:04):**  fund managers compromise, in our opinion, on the impact.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:06:07):**  They compromise always on the social and biodiversity benefit and maybe not horribly.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:06:12):**  I'm sure these are all great funds doing good work, but they're not doing aggressive work  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:06:17):**  in to solve the problems that can't be solved without massive investments.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:06:23):**  So my concern really is that problem won't be solved until we stop telling that lie to  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:06:28):**  the investment community and say, look, if you have the capacity, then you have to carve  
**[0:06:33-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:06:33):**  off some portion of your investment portfolio and assign it to a high risk activity that  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:06:41):**  could generate a return for you that is comparable, maybe not equal to, and it could in some  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:06:47):**  cases generate a higher return.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:06:49):**  But that should not be why you're doing it.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:06:52):**  Why you're doing it is to put a portion of your economic wealth to work to solve very  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:06:56):**  hard problems that need your money and that will generate enormous social and biodiversity  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:02):**  benefits well beyond what any impact fund is currently delivering and that may be able  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:08):**  to return a financial investment if they work.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:11):**  But many of them have not proven that they can work at scale and therefore you're going  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:16):**  to be taking a high risk.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:17):**  Until we start telling that story, I think we're not going to make as much progress as  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:21):**  we need to as quickly as possible in solving some of these larger problems and scaling  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:26):**  them up.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:27):**  And that concerns me.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:28):**  I think that we as a society need to find a better way to define triple bottom line.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:34):**  We need to define it not as triple return for the investor, which right now when people  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:41):**  look at triple bottom line, they think, well, I get the same financial bottom line and then  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:45):**  I get a social bottom line and a biodiversity bottom line.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:48):**  Who would not make that investment?  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:50):**  But that's a fiction and we need to start the conversation over with how do you value  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:07:57):**  the social and biodiversity benefits in society, possibly even financially, how do you value  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:08:03):**  them so that an investment that generates tremendous social and biodiversity and or  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:08:08):**  biodiversity benefit is more highly prized than an investment that generates high financial  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:08:13):**  return.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:08:15):**  Until we figure that one out, I suspect that progress will be too slow in general and the  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:08:21):**  lives of people like me will remain to be a significant challenge.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:08:26):**  But yeah, so that's the big challenge I see on the horizon is how do we rethink the notion  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:08:34):**  of value.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:08:35):**  I mean, money and financial value is an entirely fictitious creation of our societies to allow  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:08:42):**  us to function.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:08:43):**  We need a new fictitious creation in some respects that values in real terms social  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:08:49):**  benefit and biodiversity benefits so that it's not a compromise.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:08:54):**  It's more valuable to us as a society right now.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:08:56):**  We need to acknowledge that and somehow, but also within the realities that people have  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:09:01):**  to buy food to eat and pay for school fees and drive themselves around and all these  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:09:08):**  other things.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:09:09):**  So that's the challenge I think is how do we create real value in social and biodiversity  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:09:15):**  impact that is recognized in real terms that allows investors to make investment decisions  
**[0:09:21-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:09:21):**  purely on those benefits rather than secondarily on those benefits.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:09:29):**  I think you touch on an extremely interesting point.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:09:32):**  We've sold a lot of these funds and a lot of these impact investments as it is something  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:09:37):**  easy as you can just do your normal investments.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:09:40):**  You put another set of glasses on and you'll be fine.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:09:43):**  And I think another underlying illusion is there it's easy in general to make money with  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:09:50):**  money.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:09:51):**  It's easy to make investments and if you're just making investment, you probably will  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:09:55):**  make what X return because somebody in Instagram made so much money.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:01):**  And the truth is it's not easy to grow money and it's not easy in general.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:05):**  It's not easy in the impact space and it's not easy in the normal economy or in the economy  
**[0:10:10-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:10):**  to make more money with money.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:12):**  We only hear the success stories but the truth is most people in Silicon Valley are losing  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:16):**  money and we only hear the few that are doing it well and that fuels our mind like, oh,  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:21):**  I could also do that, which is probably not true.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:24):**  And if you then look at the impact investing space and you want to also make a 10X return,  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:29):**  it's going to be very tricky because you are, like you said, dealing with agriculture.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:33):**  You are dealing with people far away from any road and of course there are real costs  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:37):**  it's the real economy and the real world.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:38):**  So you're happy if you get a return and if that is compensating for inflation and some  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:45):**  of the risk.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:46):**  And I think it's the illusion of easy returns in all of society is something we should also  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:52):**  really battle because it makes any discussion really difficult because everybody would say,  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:56):**  yeah, but I could get 20% there.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:10:58):**  But if you really look over long stretches of time, I mean, these returns aren't there  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:03):**  anyway.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:05):**  But it's in people's mind that it's easy money somewhere else.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:08):**  So why would they invest in this case in Congo?  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:10):**  Right.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:11):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:12):**  I mean, there are very easy ways to examine your premise because if you look at the performance  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:20):**  of all the fund managers and all the high net worth individual asset managers of the  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:27):**  world, what are they telling their clients they can receive as a long term return on  
**[0:11:33-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:33):**  their investment?  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:34):**  It's not 30%.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:36):**  And these are people whose entire lives have been around how to make money for their clients  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:41):**  and scouring the world for a portfolio of investments to give them the best financial  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:46):**  return and they're not generating crazy returns.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:49):**  So you look at those averages and the performance of money managers around the world and you  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:54):**  get a pretty good idea of how difficult it is to actually make money with money because  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:11:59):**  they have unlimited amounts of money and unlimited access to brains and thought leadership on  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:05):**  how to turn that money into more money.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:06):**  And it is still tough.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:09):**  Still they can't get it done.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:13):**  No, I mean, a story I was told by somebody in Kenya.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:15):**  Our core project is in Kenya.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:16):**  We've been there many years.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:18):**  In Nairobi, which is a very nice African city, it's very, very developed and has lots of  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:23):**  creature comforts for expatriates and is a very short distance to elephants.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:28):**  So lots of people like being in Nairobi.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:33):**  So there are something like 89 impact funds in looking for venture deals in Nairobi.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:42):**  And I had friends with some of the people involved in some of the funds and one of them  
**[0:12:46-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:46):**  told me that, you know, it was the past three years, between all 89 of them, they'd done  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:54):**  two deals.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:12:56):**  So you can imagine how much money is just sitting there looking for this.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:02):**  It's a management fee.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:05):**  It's just earning management fees for all these fund managers while they look for the  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:08):**  Holy Grail, while they scour the landscape for this Uber of Nairobi.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:14):**  Little beast, exactly, the Uber of Nairobi.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:17):**  That's exactly what they're looking for.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:18):**  They're looking for the Uber of Nairobi or they're looking for the Archer Daniels Midland  
**[0:13:24-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:24):**  of Nairobi, you know, how to make an agricultural giant, a sustainable agricultural giant that  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:31):**  will generate returns in the billions for their high net worth investors.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:36):**  So yeah.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:37):**  So there's work to be done there.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:39):**  I think that that money could be doing far more good if the storyline had been different.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:46):**  I don't dispute that today in today's world, financial investors need the promise of a  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:54):**  return and that's not, I'm not, a promise of a financial return for their financial  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:13:59):**  investment.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:14:01):**  But I think that their expectations need to be reset in terms of what is possible and  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:14:07):**  we need to find a way to reward them for the social and biodiversity benefit on top of,  
**[0:14:14-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:14:14):**  in real terms, on top of the financial reward if we really want to see success in that sector.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:14:22):**  Thank you for the last point.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:14:23):**  I think it's a great point to end this interview, but to finalize it with one more question.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:14:31):**  What should smart impact investors look for?  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:14:33):**  After all we heard now to become active in this space, what would you advise them?  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:14:39):**  I would advise them to focus on the impact that they want to have.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:14:45):**  There's no point in being in an impact investment fund if the fund isn't having the impact.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:14:49):**  I mean, there is a point, maybe it makes for great cocktail party conversation.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:14:55):**  But most of it, in my opinion, and from the ones I've met, most of these impact investors,  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:15:01):**  when you get to the source of the money, they truly want to have an impact in some aspect  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:15:05):**  of life that they have a passion for.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:15:09):**  And so my advice to them is don't lose sight of the passion you have for the impact you  
**[0:15:14-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:15:14):**  desire and make that requirement the highest order requirement for some section of your,  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:15:22):**  some segment of your portfolio.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:15:24):**  And don't let the fund manager come back to you and say, well, you know, I wasn't able  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:15:27):**  to find anything because what he's essentially saying is I can't, I'm worried about my own  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:15:33):**  job if I can't deliver a financial return to you that is competitive because of what  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:15:38):**  I told you when I established the fund and I couldn't find anything that creates a competitive  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:15:43):**  return and addresses your passion.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:15:46):**  That's essentially the long version of what they're telling you.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:15:49):**  So it's incumbent on the impact investor to say, all right, try again.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:15:54):**  Don't worry, here's a five-year contract to go find me these deals regardless of the financial  
**[0:15:59-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:15:59):**  return.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:00):**  Well, yes, we can have a financial return target, but I really want to see my money  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:07):**  make an impact on this issue.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:09):**  So go find me deals that address this issue regardless of the financial return and then  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:13):**  we'll have a conversation about whether or not I'm willing to accept the return risk,  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:19):**  et cetera, profile of those deals.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:21):**  But really focus on the impact.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:24):**  Don't think just because you're investing in an education fund that you're going to  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:27):**  have high impact on education because if you've made the principal criteria, their financial  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:33):**  return, the fund manager will find a creative way to call it education and make the return  
**[0:16:39-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:39):**  in order to keep their jobs.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:42):**  So I think a lot of the onus has to be, which is, again, not opposite of what they were,  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:48):**  the original intent, these investors wanted to have the impact.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:51):**  The problem is they also wanted to get rid of the problem of finding the deals and that's  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:55):**  where the dilemma occurs.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:16:57):**  They wanted to hand off the challenge of finding those opportunities to have that impact and  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:17:03):**  in doing so, they're now employing somebody to do it for them and that person has a whole  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:17:07):**  different risk profile than the original investor.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:17:11):**  And therein lies the dilemma is how do you transfer that risk profile that the original  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:17:16):**  investor has through the funds and in many cases through multiple layers of funds because  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:17:21):**  the money is so big these days in impact that there's a global education fund that invests  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:17:27):**  in continental education funds that invest in national education funds that invest in  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:17:32):**  girls' education funds that finally invest in a school.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:17:37):**  And so how do you transfer the economic or the risk profile of the original investor  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:17:44):**  and the desire for impact first through all those layers of professional management to  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:17:50):**  make sure that the actual investments meet the original impact desire?  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:17:54):**  That's a real challenge and I don't know the answer but I do know that the impact investors  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:17:59):**  themselves cannot delegate that responsibility.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:18:03):**  They need to focus on that issue if they want to see that problem solved.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:18:10):**  Thank you so much, Mike, for this interview.

**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:19:36):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:19:40):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording

**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:20:57):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/#t=0:21:02):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.

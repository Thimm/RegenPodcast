**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:13):**  How a London City private banker took a permaculture course and now applies his finance knowledge  to build the biggest regenerative farm of the UK.  Definitely stay until the end to hear from Mark Drouill, the Executive Chair, how investors  
**[0:00:27-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:27):**  are responding to the new equity offer compared to debt of new foundation farms.  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:40):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:54):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:02):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:15-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:15):**  our work.  And so many of you have joined as a member.  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:23):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:36):**  Thank you.  Welcome to another episode.  This time where we peel new foundation farms even further.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:42):**  This time we have Paul Pizzala, the chief investment officer on why a good business  model is key and carbon credits are a distraction.  Welcome Paul.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:51):**  Hello Jun.  So, to start with your personal story, how did you end up at new foundation farms and  going so deep literally in soil business models and all of that?  
**[0:02:00-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:00):**  The short answer is the global financial crisis in 2008-2009 prompted a lot of questions about  what is the purpose of finance.  So I can give you the sort of the plain vanilla story about...  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:16):**  Now we want a long one.  Okay, how that took me to, you know, doing a lot of research into the whole area of climate  change.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:24):**  But if I wind the clock back, you know, it was watching David Attenborough documentaries  about the natural world.  And then there's always that kind of bit at the end where the forests were getting, you  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:39):**  know, sown down by the loggers and there was always a bit of a sting in the tail.  And that was kind of, you know, we'd sit there in the TV room with mum and my grandfather  at the time and my brother.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:52):**  And you know, my mother would always say, well, you know, she'd sort of gloss over that  bit at the end and pretend it wasn't happening.  So you just focus on all the nice bits, but somehow or the other, that was the bit that  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:03):**  kind of stuck with me.  And yeah, so, you know, I've always been into things like climbing, getting into the outdoors  and it's been a real kind of, you know, being in nature has been a real source of joy and  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:18):**  solace and connection in a very crazy, complicated, fast paced world.  So I've always been very, had that sort of deep joy and wonder of nature.  And what sort of happened during the global financial crisis, I asked myself, you know,  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:33):**  what is finance doing to solve these issues that we're facing?  And you know, on the back of that, I started doing some courses.  I did a permaculture course back in, I think it was 2008, 2009.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:49):**  And it just completely opened up my, changed my perspective in terms of the direction of  travel of an industrial society, particularly from this perspective of agricultural permaculture  and systems change and sort of understanding how industrial agriculture got to the state  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:10):**  of where it is today.  In some ways it's a quirk of fate, you know, post the second world war and there was a  lot of carbon nitrates and potassiums for munitions to be used.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:21):**  And you know, somebody had a great idea of using it as fertilizer and hey presto, nobody  really knew that fertilizer was sort of destroying soil biology.  That was one side of it.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:31):**  The other side of it was learning about soil.  And we had this really cool guy called Rod Edward who was leading the course.  And I would sort of describe him as the Doctor Who of permaculture, a real kind of cool,  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:46):**  interesting character with his farm up in, I think it was Lancashire, up in the Dales.  And he basically kind of demonstrated every aspect of permaculture on his farm, you know,  from companion planting, how to use sort of passive heating through solar masses, you  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:05):**  know, rainwater collection, kind of all these different sorts of technologies on his farm.  So it's like a sense of alternative technology, but in real time.  But the big thing that really sort of blew my mind with these concepts that if you do  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:18):**  permaculture or horticulture the right way, that the yield is infinite.  And it was just a real kind of concept that stuck in my mind, which seems to completely  blow conventional logic out of the water.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:29):**  I know many people that did a permaculture course and then actually didn't, maybe they  changed their garden or they, but let's say professionally, they haven't put that to work  as much as you're doing now.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:41):**  So what happened after that?  Like how did you, you could have come back to banking like after the week or two weeks  or whatever the number was and you could have been back in the normal financial world, but  
**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:53):**  you didn't.  And you find yourself at a new foundation farms, which is really ambitious in terms  of bringing permaculture and the whole principle of regenerative principles of regenerative  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:02):**  agriculture to scale.  So what happened in between that?  Like what made that shift from this is great.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:07):**  I now see that infinite yields are potentially possible and everything I thought about ag  is different, but then you actually start, okay, I need to work in this space.  I mean, Monday to Friday or to Saturday, my block of time that I use, my financial brain  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:21):**  and needs to be put to work in this space.  So what was that journey like?  Yeah, great question.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:26):**  And it wasn't a logical sequence of events at all.  So I heard about a place called Schumacher college when I was on this permaculture course  and it sounded like a very interesting place to learn about these alternative narratives  
**[0:06:44-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:44):**  and ecology.  And I looked up, I was working in the city at the time and private banking and you know,  I went back to private banking, but I, I did my research on Schumacher college and I had  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:59):**  a chat with some folks about it and I said, Oh, Schumacher, he's the guy who wrote Small  is Beautiful and looked at the curriculum, you know, complexity science, deep ecology,  you know, all sorts of really interesting stuff, but also a completely different way  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:13):**  of learning as well, much more embodied way of learning as well as an analytical way of  learning.  And that was when I jumped ship from the city in 2012 to take this deep dive into ecology.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:26):**  I mean, I've always been a bit of a risk taker, you know, coming from a financial background.  So I was quite comfortable doing that and I'd always wanted to be an entrepreneur in  some shape or form.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:36):**  So it felt like a, it felt like the right thing to do.  And of course at Schumacher college, they have a horticulture program.  They have the holistic science program, which is what I did.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:47):**  They have a, what they call regenerative economics program now, which is they're going to launch  a regenerative agriculture program in September this year.  So some really exciting and fantastic things happening there.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:59):**  And that's kind of really opened up a whole new level of understanding in terms of the  challenges that we face.  You know, what I found really interesting about Schumacher college is that the narrative  
**[0:08:10-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:10):**  was very much about a local economy transition based change to addressing climate change  and the other, if you like planetary boundaries that are, whether it's deforestation, ocean  acidification, so on and so forth, the solutions are very much presented through the lens of  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:31):**  transition and local change.  And I did follow that route for a while.  Like I got involved in local renewable energy and raising finance for hydro and solar projects,  
**[0:08:42-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:42):**  but it sort of struck me that those projects was very useful and important at a local level  weren't going to shift the needle at an industrial macro scale.  So on the back of that, I went back to the city and I ended up getting a job with an  
**[0:08:59-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:59):**  impact fund manager in public equity markets who had their own theory of change and way  of dividing up the market into positive impacts, let's say neutral and negative impact companies.  And kind of what you end up with is quite a small bucket of investable companies that  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:09:20):**  are doing something positive in the world.  And it sort of struck me that that's brilliant, but there's this other 95% capital that needs  to make the shift.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:09:31):**  And what really sparked my interest was to find the entrepreneurs that were the disruptive  entrepreneurs that were putting these solutions into practice on the ground and on the back  of that, that's really, I've known Mark for about four or five years and we talked about  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:09:51):**  various different projects.  We talked about launching a fund on the back of the office book, The Meaningful Economy.  But that didn't really speak to me, but when he came to my office with Marcus and pitched  
**[0:10:03-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:03):**  the idea of new foundation farms, it was just so obvious to me that the soil is the core  asset of humanity, not just agriculture.  And so that's kind of when I literally sort of leapt out of my chair and said, yes, this  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:18):**  is, this is for me.  But they like pitched it to you to join or they pitched because they were looking for  money?  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:25):**  Yeah, they pitched to me cause they were looking for money.  And I was super excited in the process of working with them and looking at strategy  and going through pitch decks.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:35):**  We formed a very trusted, close relationship and eventually sort of six months ago joined  as chief investment officer.  And which is actually an excellent bridge to what we already discussed in the previous  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:48):**  interviews, obviously the fundraising process and what has changed over the last weeks because  you were, and obviously please walk me through the process.  You are still really ambitious, but raising 20 million pounds sterling in depth and we  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:03):**  uncovered that and we also discussed the differences or the unusual way of doing that or the fact  that you raise such a large depth instead of equity or instead of a mix, et cetera.  Obviously everything about new foundation farms is quite unusual, but you have made  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:16):**  some changes in the last couple of weeks.  Can you speak a bit about what you've learned and the why of these changes in the offering  basically obviously very clearly this is not investment advice, but I'm very interested  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:27):**  in how these mechanisms work and obviously learning or pitching to so many people and  having so many conversations has changed something within the organization and you've now adjusted,  let's say the offerings.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:41):**  I'm very curious about that process.  Yeah, that's a great question.  So the initial offer was to have a preference share, which is in effect a securitized investment  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:55):**  that has the collateral of the company's assets as security.  So it gives the investor a good feeling of comfort because there's a strong asset backing  and that comes with a fixed return, say something like a 4% coupon, which in the world of government  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:12:16):**  bonds and corporate bonds looks quite attractive.  In the world of venture capital, impact investing and private equity, it's not going to really  excite anybody.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:12:29):**  So there's the sort of the nature of ambition of financial capital seeking return.  That's definitely one aspect that came back to us in terms of having a better balance  of risk return and impact.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:12:43):**  The impact story has never been an issue.  That's a real driver in terms of interest and that's the hook.  What was causing some investors to fall off the hook was the financial return on offer.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:00):**  But it wasn't just that it's only 4%.  It's well, hang on a second.  We want to be in the journey with you, boots and all, and to be fully participating as  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:11):**  a risk taker, that means we want the upside as well as the risk and as well as the impact.  So that was really that side of the story.  And then we took that feedback and we looked at it more closely ourselves in order for  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:27):**  everybody to be aligned and motivated and sharing risk equally.  When you sort of step back and take a look at it, it does make sense for investors and  founders to be equally on the line in terms of risk and reward.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:45):**  So it's just a much better alignment of interests at the end of the day.  And so can you walk us through what you're currently, so what has changed from that 20  million of preferred shares with a 4% return?  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:59):**  What are you currently looking for?  What are you currently talking to, talking about to investors?  Sure.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:05):**  Okay.  So that's 20 million and broadly speaking, 16 million of that is in farmland acquisition,  a thousand acre farm with some capital expenditure for retail and processing on the farm.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:22):**  And then roughly 4 million for what we would call enterprise development.  So for the executive team, for the systems, consulting, so on and so forth, ready to develop  the enterprise platform to be able to scale the business well above and beyond a thousand  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:40):**  acres.  So what's on offer for investors?  Well, it's 25% of the profits of the company.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:49):**  So effectively what you would be getting is a 25% share of the profits of the company  and you would be getting the security of the asset.  So in a way what we've done is we've said, look, the mission, the impact, the business  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:06):**  model, all of that stays exactly the same.  There's no change there.  What we're doing is recognizing that investors want, they want more upside that comes with  
**[0:15:16-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:16):**  the risk.  And we're also saying, you know, to make this a really good deal for you, we're making sure  that providers of capital are first in line in the capital structure.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:30):**  So the money is capitalized by the assets of the company, i.e. the farmlands, the capex,  you know, cash on the balance sheet.  So in those terms, I mean, if I was looking at it, I would be going, wow, that's a really  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:44):**  good deal.  Of course, with a different risk structure, because it could be less than 4%.  What's the duration?  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:50):**  Like, it's buying back equity with the profit, like a profit sharing.  How long am I potentially as an investor, like how long am I part of the journey?  In this case, where's the cap?  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:00):**  So a good benchmark would be to think in terms of venture capital or private equity.  In terms of risk, basically.  Yeah, in terms of risk, but also in terms of how long do I need to think, what is my  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:12):**  time horizon as an investor?  So your time horizon has got to be really at least 10 years, you know.  So it's going to take four years to get to a point where we're demonstrating profitability  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:26):**  at that stage of the game.  When we've proven out the business model, the ecology, the economics, the processing,  the brand, the customer satisfaction, the ability to add complementary enterprises on  
**[0:16:40-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:40):**  the farm, it's at that stage then we can go out to the market and talk to other landholders  or other farmers and start to plan for the next 2,000, 3,000 acres regionally.  And that will take some time to do that.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:58):**  So realistically, in 10 years, could we be at 10,000 acres?  Absolutely yes.  That's the next milestone.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:06):**  In terms of our modeling, what does that look like to investors?  That's something like a two to three times return, very conservatively, because we're  not baking in any of the complementary activities.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:19):**  We're not baking in carbon offsets.  The whole carbon offset-  Nice bridge.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:24):**  Yeah, thank you.  The whole carbon offset story, for us, that's dropped straight to the bottom line and that  can really supercharge returns.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:33):**  The big story is when you get to 60,000 acres, you get a lot of leverage and economies of  scale and a lot of learning of costs in the business.  So we will learn a lot in terms of what we can do, what we can't do, how we can optimize  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:48):**  the business, how we can optimize revenue streams, so on and so forth.  You could be looking at 10, 20 times your money on a 60,000 acre scale.  So that's where the patient money really gets its return, but also that's where it really  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:04):**  gets its impact because at that sort of scale, then you've got a big voice in terms of being  able to demonstrate that, yes, regenerative agriculture does exactly what it said we would  do and it probably does a host of other things that we didn't even know it was capable of  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:20):**  too.  So that's why you need to have a long-term horizon.  So does it mean, let's say I invest, does it mean that there's a fixed time or a fixed  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:31):**  return in a sense?  Is there 10 years and then whatever came back from the 25% profit, that's great.  And then we close the deal and I'm no longer part of the company or is there like in some  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:43):**  other, let's say revenue share, revenue based one, okay, until 3x and then we close the  deal or is there no end to the deal, it just continues to flow also after 10 years, mostly  structured?  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:55):**  Yeah, no, absolutely.  I mean, personally, I would love investors to stay for the whole journey.  That could be 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 50 years.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:04):**  I'm hoping that regenerative agriculture in the UK is going to be around for the next few  hundred years.  So you could imagine a scenario where as an investor, you hold onto this and you pass  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:18):**  it on to the next generation.  Absolutely.  You could also imagine a scenario where an investor, they want to exit in 10 years time  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:27):**  or 15 years time or wherever it happens to be and they can sell their shares.  Absolutely.  And we would help to facilitate that type of transaction.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:35):**  And I'm imagining there's some kind of, I wouldn't say lock up, but as there's a longer,  I mean, you will have that discussion with every investor.  Look, this is a long term thing.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:42):**  Don't come after two years and say, please find somewhere to sell my shares.  Is there any commitment they have to commit to, like at least five years or at least seven  years to be part of the journey?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:53):**  Or do you leave that to the investor to do that?  Like, is there any signs like, OK, I know this is long term, so at least I'm on board  for five years and then we'll see what have you done there?  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:02):**  Yeah, I mean, I think that's it's more implicit than explicit.  So if you look at the financial model and you look at the pitch, you know, the first  thousand acres, which we get to profitability and say, four years, that's just the start  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:19):**  of the journey.  So really, as a bare minimum, you have to be thinking in terms of four to five years.  You know, if you're a foundation and you're granting money, that's kind of the first big  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:32):**  milestone that you want to see us achieve.  And yet that's a different type of money, obviously.  As an investor, you know, that's obviously the first milestone you want to see us achieve.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:43):**  Now you want to see us achieve the next milestone, which is 10000 acres.  And is that five years, six years, seven years?  It depends.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:51):**  Yeah, it depends how fast things move and how well we execute.  So as an investor, you've got to have a 10 year time horizon if you want to maximize  both your financial return and the impact of the business.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:08):**  And we've had some amazing introductions from doing these podcasts with you, Kyun.  Shout out to the community.  Thank you for responding.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:16):**  Yeah, big shout out to the community.  And you know, when impact investors get this stuff, who come from a private equity or a  venture capital background, their insightfulness and the quality of their questions into, you  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:32):**  know, the business model and also the way that we're structuring the business is that  is exactly the type of investor that we want on board.  You're really super smart, commercially highly intelligent, highly creative, and actually  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:50):**  really, really supportive.  So you're not getting into an argument about does your business model work or does regenerative  agriculture work?  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:59):**  You're getting really smart, supportive questions to help you do a much better job.  And let's kind of step back, look at the big picture here, right?  Okay, so agriculture is a big contributor to climate change, deforestation, biodiversity  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:22:17):**  loss, water runoff, eutrophication in oceans.  So if you really get that stuff, you want to see us succeed big time so we can replicate  this model 20 times in the UK, a thousand times in Europe, a thousand times in America,  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:22:35):**  10,000 times in Asia.  So that's the kind of level of commitment that personally I'm looking for from investors.  You know, somebody, people that, yeah, let's make a whole load of money and create a whole  
**[0:22:46-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:22:46):**  load of wealth, but let's also completely change the whole story about ecological capital  creation in the UK, Europe, US and Asia.  Yeah, I think it's fascinating for anybody obviously interested to reach out, but I had  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:02):**  the pleasure to go through the deal room or the data room and there's a lot of information  in there if you're interested in the discussion animal versus non-animal and regenerative  ag on Enough is Enough, which we obviously discussed with Marcus, like the commitment  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:16):**  and the level of thought, not just on the ag piece, and we discussed it a lot with the  interview with Marcus, but also on the enterprise piece, like how to structure this for the  long run as well.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:27):**  And you automatically select the type of investors that are interested in that because if you  go through all of that and if you're not interested as you would have stopped reading a long time  ago or stopped listening to this interview as well.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:37):**  So it's interesting how that's a self selecting and how much thought and work you have put  in this on the non-farming piece before.  And I'm not even talking about the processing, I'm just talking about the enterprise structures.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:49):**  And we have discussed it obviously, how to keep the purpose of the company and the steering  wheel focused on the long term, which is my follow up question.  We've discussed it often with the guys and girls of Purpose Capital, Purpose Ventures  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:01):**  and others like how to make sure that not a majority of the equity shareholders after  six years because they changed their mind or they donated, they inherited the shares  from whoever or got it and suddenly say, no, actually let's sell all this land and build  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:16):**  a lot of villas because development is maybe easier.  So as you have pivoted partly to more equity and profit share model, has that purpose piece  changed and how is that, I'm imagining, not so implicit but more explicit, like making  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:31):**  sure this is a 20, 30 plus year thing and not if you change your mind in six years or  Mark changes his mind or some of the shareholders say, okay, let's build a really big amusement  park and let's copy Disneyland in the UK.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:46):**  Has that changed or not with this new raising?  Very good question.  I think we've really sharpened up on the governance and how the different stakeholders in the  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:57):**  business and the enterprise are represented.  So effectively you've got investors, founders, employees, community.  So we really think it's very important that the community of shoppers have a voice in  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:25:14):**  the business, not just from the point of view of it's a good marketing tactic, but from  the point of view of really helping to create a close connection to where does my food come  from and how is it made and how is the land affected and just really helping to bring  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:25:36):**  the shoppers into the whole equation of how do we grow food and what does it mean to run  the business.  And of course the employees is the other stakeholder.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:25:47):**  So the purpose lock of the business being a regenerative enterprise that grows nutrient  dense food and fiber and regenerating soils that stays the same and that is enshrined  in the articles of association.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:01):**  So you'd have to have nothing short of a revolution with pitchforks and guns to change the purpose  of the organization.  So that would be an extremely unlikely event that the purpose of the organization would  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:16):**  change because A, it's the culture of the organization that is incredibly important.  At the end of the day governance is incredibly important as a check and a balance in order  to steer the ship.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:29):**  But in my view in the organizations that I've worked in it's the culture that you create  that really means that the purpose lives and flourishes in the people in the company.  And part of that is there's a reason why Kirstie, Wayne and myself alongside Marcus and Mark  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:50):**  are together and that's because it's not a textbook exercise for us.  It's a real embodiment of values and it's the embodiment of values that really gives  the quality assurance to the business in terms of its purpose.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:06):**  So you can think of it as a calling and more than a vocation it's a calling.  It's something that we feel very strongly about and that's what really guides the purpose  of the organization as well as having the governance structures in place in the articles  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:23):**  of association and in the structure of the business and in the way the different stakeholders  get to vote to ensure that that purpose evolves and lives on over time.  And just to push back a bit because the calling obviously is great and the culture is amazing  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:39):**  but those things can change especially we're talking about a 10, 20, 30 year movement almost  and we've seen that in the past like companies that started great and at some point things  change especially when there's a lot of money at stake.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:53):**  So I think unless the documents of association cannot be changed to a non-regenerative or  to a de-regenerative or extractive way unless there is a stop at the end like okay this  is the bare minimum that this should do for 100 years at least.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:08):**  Things always change unfortunately or fortunately I mean things shift and this is long term  stuff so unless there's a legal backstop I think that's what purpose has been pushing  for like making sure that even if somebody comes and puts a billion on the table stuff  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:22):**  is still didn't change because there is a golden chair or there is a vote that makes  sure that okay we can never go to development of this 1000 acres like that's at least it  should always be farmed regeneratively and these are the things that we consider regeneratively.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:37):**  Whatever you're also going to do things change maybe in 10 years we have a very different  outlook on animals or very different outlook on processing or very different outlook on  etc etc but that's the core needs to be preserved.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:49):**  But it's something we challenge with because of course we can say at the moment okay this  are the equity shares this is the votes but also that changes over time and things shift  and especially as we're looking long term and many have experienced that I think that  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:01):**  the culture shifts and at some point suddenly you are against the 51 vote and things that  never would be able to change are suddenly changed and that would be a shame.  So just to push back a bit on that like it's we need to really think the long term here  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:14):**  and make sure it's even goes beyond us like it goes beyond you guys the team it goes beyond  like that not I don't know if you have children with your children at some point inherit the  shares and say yeah we don't care but they probably do but we just want to develop it  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:27):**  because somebody comes with a lot of money and it changes lives.  So it's that making sure that even in the rarest cases of the opportunity of course  pitchforks and guns that we cannot work on that but all the other legal loopholes should  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:42):**  be at least closed.  Yeah I mean as far as I know there is a purpose lock in the business which enshrines the purpose  of the business as far as we possibly can in terms of what a legal document looks like.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:59):**  So you know you need to have a talk with the lawyers on this one in order to fully explore  and investigate all the potential loopholes and mechanisms for applying pressure to change  because you can never 100% guarantee something that's impossible.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:30:19):**  No no of course we just have to rule out all the known knowns that okay the rest we'll  see.  Yeah so I mean you know the you take your scenario of you know hang on a second we've  
**[0:30:31-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:30:31):**  got all this 60,000 acres of prime agricultural land which is suddenly there's an influx of  10 million people projected to come to the UK because of climate chaos right and suddenly  that regenerative land looks very exciting to build on in you know sort of 50 years time  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:30:52):**  or something like that.  You'd have to have a two-third majority of all stakeholders to change the purpose of  the organization.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:01):**  So that's a very high bar to get over.  Is there a reason why it's not a hundred or that just was impossible?  Like a unanimous vote for change of the purpose.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:13):**  If you have to have a hundred percent vote for everything then you're never going to  do anything.  No no just for the core purpose like it can never be built on or something.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:21):**  I'm curious about it I mean it's a very geeky subject probably but very curious about that  purpose lock and two-thirds is a lot but still sometimes possible.  I mean you see it with our organization but let's be conscious of time as well and I want  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:37):**  to ask some follow-up questions on the carbon piece actually that you would say a strong  opinion but quite a strong opinion on.  Like why do you say it's an interesting distraction but a good business model is key?  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:49):**  Well I mean if you sort of take you know why is there a first question why is there a carbon  price and what is the carbon price?  So it's a subsidy so a carbon price is basically a subsidy to enable entrepreneurs to take  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:32:10):**  risk or to force corporates to change the way they do business and offset their carbon  taxes.  So it's a quota subsidy tax incentive framework and mechanism so sort of at the margin it's  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:32:28):**  intended to incentivize change but it's not a strategy.  Carbon tax is not a strategy we're putting something like 50 billion tons of carbon dioxide  into the atmosphere every year so a subsidy that might be one dollars five dollars ten dollars seventy dollars per ton of carbon dioxide isn't fundamentally going to change anything.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:32:54):**  You have to have an industrial strategy and businesses that are doing the work intrinsically  that the ecological benefits or the creation of ecological capital is built into the business  model without a reliance on subsidies.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:16):**  That is the driver of change so the subsidies are really nice things to have at the margin  you know brilliant for our business but we never designed a business that needed to rely  on subsidies in order to be effective economically and ecologically.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:34):**  But if you look at the renewable energy space until recently in some places and some places  still were reliant on some kind of direct or indirect subsidies to get going and created  this industry that now is competing head to head.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:48):**  Obviously there are a lot of subsidies for the fossil fuel industry and a lot of subsidies  for the agriculture industry so maybe we should just take them away.  I mean there could be an answer to my follow-up question but so there is in that transition  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:58):**  phase as we get going and people start doing things at scale do you see a role for it or  is it a I wouldn't say waste of time but I mean to build a market in that place to do  the research to do the measurement it's a lot of folk I mean you it's a lot of distraction  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:34:14):**  potentially as well like do you think it's a distraction even in a transition phase or  is there a role for it to kick start a lot of hectares to get going or acres?  Yeah well okay so from the point of view of New Foundation Farms you know Steve Jobs didn't  
**[0:34:28-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:34:28):**  invent the iPhone by thinking about Blackberry right so my belief is that we need to focus  on what we're doing and not worry about policy carbon prices other business models you know  that that's good stuff to know and it'll become more important in the future but right now  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:34:49):**  our focus is on having a successful capital raise and executing on the first five years  of our business plan regardless I'm not the best person to talk about carbon taxes and  subsidies and things like that because you know I'm an economist I've got a masters in  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:05):**  finance and investment I'm a holistic scientist and you know I started an NGO in the States  called the Climate Map which kind of looks at a lot of these issues about how do you  scale impactful projects that are you know going to draw down gigatons so you know we  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:20):**  could do a whole new kind of community platform on that and suck up a lot of it I'm not looking  it really is super important but it's got to be joined up it's got to be holistic there  has to be an ecosystem there's got to be big corporates making the change you know like  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:37):**  Microsoft Bill Gates's breakthrough ventures all the stuff that Jeremy Grantham is doing  there's extraordinary activity at the venture capital level going on in the States at the  moment you know there's Joe Biden's Green Deal there's a vast universe of things happening  
**[0:35:54-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:54):**  so really just to kind of like focus on the carbon price it's just a piece in the puzzle  yeah it's a really important piece of the puzzle as a subsidy in order to incentivize  capital to take risk and generate new business models for sure there's no doubt about that  
**[0:36:10-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:36:10):**  but in terms of new foundation farms the regenerative agriculture piece is so strong on its own in  terms of its ability to regenerate soil and ecosystems and the business model that we've  created in terms of cutting out all the middlemen and going direct to consumer that really bumps  
**[0:36:31-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:36:31):**  the margins of the business right up we don't need to think about do we draw down eight  tons per acre at twenty dollars or is it three tons per acre at a hundred dollars we will  do that piece of work in a year's time and we'll work with who we think are the best  
**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:36:49):**  people to really push the whole agenda forward for sure absolutely that's really super exciting  but it's not our focus right now and to be conscious of your time and end with a few  questions I always like to ask I wouldn't say that I wouldn't call them fire questions  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:37:04):**  but definitely sort of rapid what do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture  that others don't where are you contrarian definitely inspired by John Kempf that usually  asked this question in a slightly different form yeah I would say my belief is that you  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:37:21):**  can produce a much higher yield than conventional agriculture and when you say yield is that  like weight or are you looking at calories and nutrients how do you define yield the  whole bushel so nutrient density vitamins weights protein whatever it is that you need  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:37:43):**  to kind of feed the world my belief is that regenerative agriculture is superior across  all dimensions dimensions compared to conventional agriculture and if you could change one thing  so you have a magic wand you can change one thing in agriculture in the food industry  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:01):**  as well I mean you can choose what would that be it would be mindset mindset is the biggest  barrier to change absolutely so if I could wave the magic wand and I could get people  to think ecologically as well as economically that is the change that I would make the real  
**[0:38:18-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:18):**  estate between our ears yes exactly absolutely 100% there's you know once you once you've  got undergone once you've had a mindset shift and you have that ecological lens you realize  that is absolutely the highest order which you can operate you know at least as we know  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:38):**  as far as we know as humans I mean I'm sure there are levels of being able to operate  but I mean effectively what it does is the question you've always got to ask yourself  is am I generating ecological capital or am I destroying ecological capital and like when  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:55):**  we had a population of one or two billion on the earth destroying ecological capital  wasn't such a big deal because there was plenty of spare capacity for our ecological systems  to restore themselves so we could get away with it it's fine with seven billion people  
**[0:39:09-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:39:09):**  on the planet and everybody wanting to have the a meat-rich diet two cars foreign holidays  you can't not think in those times anymore because the consequences are too dire and  a final question I always say final but it never is if tomorrow you'll be or actually  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:39:29):**  this morning as well in charge of a one billion dollar or one billion pounds sterling I don't  care about the currency investment funds you have a long-term view you could have you could  be super short as well if you want to but it is an investment fund meaning we're looking  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:39:42):**  not to grant but to invest could be zero percent return I mean you're free to choose what would  you focus on what would be your priorities to where and how to put the money to work  yeah I knew this question was coming and my first answer is like a billion pounds isn't  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:00):**  that much these days can we sort of can we look at I asked this question because I'm  interested in priorities like what would you focus on so let's I mean we've seen the inflation  over the lifetime of this podcast so this apparently a billion is that not that much  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:13):**  anymore so let's go for a hundred a hundred billion what would you do okay so like if  I had a hundred billion I mean I would do something like a breakthrough ventures which  is Bill Gates's kind of answer to scaling technologies that are going to deal with drawing  
**[0:40:31-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:31):**  down carbon dioxide and I would focus on regenerative entrepreneurs so I would have a you know a  hundred billion pound fund that is finding the regenerative entrepreneurs that are applying  systems thinking to solving ecological value creation and human wealth creation and I would  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:51):**  throw a lot of money at that yeah I think a perfect answer I love the breakthrough ventures  I would definitely link it below what I always miss is I mean for an engineer and technologists  it's like the place of man in nature like our role in and the nature based solutions  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:07):**  for which is a horrible name but if you see what they fund and if you see how Gates talks  about agriculture I think there's a lot to learn I would love to discuss with him here  in the podcast if anybody has an intro definitely let me know but if you I think there is that  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:21):**  kind of brainpower we need in regenerative agriculture and it seems like he's still very  far or at least the foundation and everything they do and the breakthrough ventures etc  is very far from that but that's from the outside I've never had obviously that discussion  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:36):**  with him I'm looking forward to like the potential he did tweet something a year ago I think  on soil etc so there's some interest but then the approach is always not very holistic I  think to say the least yeah I mean I haven't dived really deeply into that side of Bill  
**[0:41:57-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:57):**  Gates's life so I haven't really got a strong answer you know I I mean whenever you talk  about billionaires and their agendas it always becomes a very contentious issue I think the  direction of travel is good the more people are talking about these conversations and  
**[0:42:16-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:42:16):**  diving deeper into what regenerative agriculture actually means and how you can pursue scaling  strategies that are good for communities good for human health good for gut health good  for soil health good for biodiversity good for equality of ownership the better yeah  
**[0:42:36-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:42:36):**  I'm looking forward to discussion at some point we'll have that here I want to thank  you so much for now Paul we'll have Mark on in a second to dive a bit deeper into the  investor reactions to let's say the broadening of focus or I wouldn't call it a pivot because  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:42:50):**  it's way too hard but to talk about the funding piece but for now when I thank you for your  time your sharing of your journey and your discussion until here brilliant real pleasure  thanks so much for the airtime really appreciate it so we have Mark Drouot back on the show  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:06):**  together with Paul obviously to just reflect a bit on the reaction of investors to this  shift in fundraising to more equity piece more risk-taking and profit sharing so Mark  welcome back and let's dive straight into that what was the reaction on the floor on  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:22):**  the fundraising road show that you've been doing obviously from your home mostly but  what has been the reaction on zoom basically hello again yeah the reaction has been really  interesting because what we've realized is fundamentally people who are investing for  
**[0:43:36-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:36):**  impact or using their money to create change in the world are hardwired for risk so going  from a preference share with a fixed return to an ordinary share with no guaranteed return  but all of the excitement of a journey and the upside that's possible it just lands much  
**[0:43:55-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:55):**  more easily so it's much easier we're finding for people to say yes and has the conversation  then shift like the energy of people being interested because of course an impact piece  and the company piece nothing changed and people are either excited or not and I'm imagining  
**[0:44:11-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:11):**  if they're excited they will continue talking but but actually question to both of you Paul  and Mark has that have you seen like the last few weeks since you've been changing this  and putting this into place like a different kind of engagement or different kind of leaning  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:24):**  in I'm actually doing that now nobody can see it but leaning in of investors or just  like people self-select and the ones that are super excited about this are still the  ones you talk to and or have there been some people that are interested in the preferred  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:37):**  shares and are now no longer interested what has been the feeling around in terms of leaning  in getting to let's say the next phase of potentially commitments and obviously investments  as well I'd say first of all what's fascinating is that there hasn't been a single person  
**[0:44:49-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:49):**  who was interested in the fixed return preference shares who said thanks but now you want to  give me a general share in the ordinary shares in the company and a full share of the upside  there's been nobody who said no that's not interesting so it hasn't turned anyone off  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:05):**  on the turning people on side from the beginning of our journey sort of eight ten weeks ago  we had a number of people who said just look I love what you're doing but what I need you  to do is if you want my money you're going to have to give me a share of the upside because  
**[0:45:20-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:20):**  that's what I do that's how I invest so what's happened is this open the door to a whole  raft of people who had previously said I love it but you know you don't fit my investment  profile yeah and absolutely and I also think not only has it released that extra amount  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:36):**  of energy with investors it's also galvanized the team at new foundation farms too so in  that sense it's definitely a win-win so there's more energy for the reins on all sides and  in terms of timeline what has changed or has that changed at all so the timeline up until  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:55):**  now we have been talking to people on the basis of saying this is the offer and we're  talking to a wide range of different kinds of investor with a view to understanding what  makes sense the result of that that cycle is now ending and so our expectation is that  
**[0:46:12-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:46:12):**  within two weeks from now the offer will change from draft to a document that says the offer  opens on date X which should be around the middle of May and closes on date Y which will  have an initial close at the end of June so we're shifting from conversations about decision  
**[0:46:33-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:46:33):**  to invest do you like what we're saying to right this is now the journey are you in or  out and we are now filling the book and the ambition is that that will allow us to acquiring  land and be on the first thousand acres by the end of the summer very very interesting  
**[0:46:49-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:46:49):**  and just to wrap up we discussed in the interview if you're still here with us you for sure  heard it a lot on governance structure and I was pushing a bit on the purpose sled and  how to make sure there's a purpose locker we just we discussed it quite extensively  
**[0:47:04-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:04):**  but I'm very interested in I didn't dive deeper into it so I can ask now again on the two  thirds so Paul mentioned there has to be a two-third vote majority vote of all stakeholders  individually so all the pieces and I would love to know a bit more on that to change  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:17):**  the purpose of the company but Mark you are deep into that as well what does that two  third mean and why is that two third two thirds is really important if you look at the the  constitutions of most countries around the world most written constitutions they basically  
**[0:47:31-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:31):**  say for for general decision-making 50% vote of whoever's got to make the decision is fine  but if it's something big and fundamental it requires a two-thirds majority of everybody  so in this case the way we structured it basically says you need a two-thirds vote of the employees  
**[0:47:49-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:49):**  and to change any article in the company's articles two-thirds vote the employees and  a two-thirds vote of the investors or the funders and a two-thirds vote of society and  for as long as the founders are around a two-thirds vote of the founders and a two-thirds vote  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:48:03):**  of the board now that's a very very high bar but it does mean that if in two generations  time people wake up and say actually this particular article or this statement of purpose  isn't right and we need to move it on then you can and so you don't hold society you  
**[0:48:19-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:48:19):**  don't two generations time to an absolute specific that we thought was really clever  right now yeah it gives you the chances thank you so much for elaborating on that and thank  you both for coming on for allowing us to follow this journey and be sort of flying  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:48:34):**  the war on some of these things and looking forward to continue doing that obviously and  wishing you a great day today and looking forward to the next one and have a regenerative  time good it's all going good thank you yeah thanks so much kyun really real pleasure to

**[0:50:13-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:50:13):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:50:22-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:50:22):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  and recording this podcast since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:50:35-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:50:35):**  How have we built our decision-making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  
**[0:50:44-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:50:44):**  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?  
**[0:50:47-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:50:47):**  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  
**[0:50:53-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:50:53):**  You the soil builders and investors in the space.  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, agtech companies, farm to gut food  
**[0:51:05-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:51:05):**  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management, consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:51:15-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:51:15):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  Is this course free?  
**[0:51:26-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:51:26):**  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:51:34-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:51:34):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.

**[0:51:55-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:51:55):**  so you don't have to ride along.  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:52:08-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:52:08):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:52:19-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:52:19):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  
**[0:52:29-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:52:29):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:52:37):**  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:13):**  We're going to listen to an interview with Michiel Dumas, Strategy Director at Common  
**[0:00:17-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:17):**  Land.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:18):**  We're going to talk about many different things in this interview, ranging from how  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:22):**  impact investors can get involved, what the difficulties are and how we could maybe overcome  
**[0:00:27-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:27):**  them.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:28):**  We're going to talk about regenerative elements and how to work with many farmers in one of  
**[0:00:32-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:32):**  the driest regions in Spain.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:35):**  And we're going to look into the fur return model, which is the cornerstone model of Common  
**[0:00:39-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:39):**  Land.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:40):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:41):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:47-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:47):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:48):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:53):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:00:58):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:03):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:05):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:09):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:11):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:16):**  attention to the dirt, soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:21):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:25):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:28):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:32):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:37):**  depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:41):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:46):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:51):**  support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:53):**  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:01:58):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:02:01):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:02:03):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, agriculture as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:02:07):**  I'm Koen van Sijen, the host of today.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:02:09):**  In the podcast today, I'm talking to Michiel de Man, Strategy Director of Commonland.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:02:13):**  Commonland is one of the leading organizations working on business cases to restore landscapes.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:02:18):**  Welcome Michiel.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:02:19):**  Thank you Koen.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:02:20):**  Thanks for the introduction.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:02:22):**  Yeah, to start with a personal question, why are you doing what you're doing?  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:02:30):**  I guess this started when I graduated at high school.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:02:35):**  I moved to Australia for a year and traveled around, had a lot of fun and I continued traveling  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:02:41):**  for another year in Europe.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:02:44):**  And what struck me was that everywhere we came in those old VW vans, we saw either nature  
**[0:02:55-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:02:55):**  because we spend a lot of time in nature or in economically developed areas, so to speak,  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:03:05):**  where nature had gone.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:03:07):**  And we basically saw in many cases, a lot of destruction.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:03:10):**  And the question arose then already in me, why is economic development always going at  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:03:18):**  the cost of our natural environment and can't we find other ways?  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:03:23):**  And that sort of determined my career, I guess.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:03:28):**  For that reason, I've always tried to focus on the business world at the one side, understanding  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:03:33):**  how business works and what are its impacts on people and on the planet, but especially  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:03:39):**  also, can we find ways to do business that instead of further trashing the planet, actively  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:03:46):**  contribute to restoring it?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:03:49):**  And that's been basically my quest in my career.  
**[0:03:52-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:03:52):**  And that's also has led me about four years back to, together with Bidde and Fereda, establish  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:04:00):**  what has now become Commonland.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:04:04):**  Commonland basically believes that we need to develop a large scale landscape restoration  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:04:11):**  industry.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:04:13):**  And we actually don't see an alternative to counter the crisis of biodiversity loss of  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:04:20):**  losing soils worldwide, of water stress, but also climate change.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:04:27):**  And not to even mention the food security questions, we don't see there's any other  
**[0:04:34-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:04:34):**  way than by restoring land, both on productive lands, so farms, and also of ecological zones.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:04:42):**  And that sort of has been the basis of the model we've developed and also the projects  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:04:47):**  that we have developed over the last couple of years.  
**[0:04:51-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:04:51):**  Projects that promote large scale land restoration and large scale regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:05:00):**  We really see that the only way to do that is by actively involving the private sector.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:05:06):**  And also, another really important ingredient is to do this on the long term.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:05:13):**  So next quarter profits, they won't make this happen.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:05:19):**  We really try and have a long term vision, a 20 year vision, actually.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:05:22):**  And that sort of scares off some people, but it's very attractive to others.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:05:27):**  For instance, we are seeing that many family offices, people who think cross generationally  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:05:34):**  are really interested in this.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:05:36):**  And also those are probably the people who are going to actually contribute to this development  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:05:41):**  of large scale restoration and regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:05:47):**  So the model that we have been developing over the last couple of years, not only conceptually,  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:05:52):**  but especially in projects, making it happen, has been the four returns, three zones, 20  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:05:58):**  year model.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:05:59):**  And the four returns, and I'm sure you've probably seen that we've talked about this  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:06:05):**  before, in our view, it starts with inspiration.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:06:09):**  It starts with finding motivated farmers and land managers to do things differently on  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:06:18):**  their land, to actively start restoring soils, to change the way of production.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:06:24):**  But the crux is to make it fun, to make it inspiring, to touch people's hearts.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:06:30):**  And it's not us who do that.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:06:31):**  It's those people in the fields that are already convinced.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:06:36):**  And what we do is we connect them to others and that our mobilization is a very important  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:06:41):**  part of our project.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:06:43):**  And it starts with inspiration.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:06:45):**  The second thing, of course, is the social capital, what we call jobs, people wanting  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:06:53):**  to work together.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:06:56):**  We think that's paramount.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:06:57):**  There is no way we can restore the planet without getting the people actively involved  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:07:02):**  in making a buck out of it.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:07:04):**  And obviously the natural impacts are a result of that.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:07:08):**  So if we are able to restore the soil, biodiversity and water, that's obviously key.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:07:15):**  I think in the end our whole economy depends on that.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:07:19):**  Well, and if you do all of that well, so if you create restoration that's based on meaningful  
**[0:07:27-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:07:27):**  activities on agricultural lands, people making money, that can also provide an investment  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:07:35):**  case and in financial returns.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:07:39):**  And yeah, for that model, so the four returns model, that was the concept that Willem basically  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:07:44):**  developed four years back.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:07:48):**  And since then has been at the basis of four projects that we have developed now.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:07:54):**  And increasingly we see other organizations adapting it and there's a lot of interest  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:08:01):**  in applying it.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:08:02):**  I think it's probably because it's quite simple to use.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:08:05):**  Basically the 3P model, people plan a profit, but I think the inspirational aspect to it  
**[0:08:11-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:08:11):**  is what matters most.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:08:13):**  At least it makes me still wanting to do this work every day.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:08:19):**  And when you look at the projects and the practical level, can you dive a bit deeper  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:08:24):**  into the ones you've been working on for the last few years and maybe pick out one  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:08:28):**  example to really explain how these four returns model work in practice?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:08:34):**  Yeah, so I've been personally involved most in our Spanish project.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:08:41):**  We have developed or helped develop projects in Australia, South Africa, Spain and the  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:08:46):**  Netherlands.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:08:48):**  Last year I've been very deeply involved in our Spanish project.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:08:52):**  It's great fun to travel, to have an excuse to travel south every now and then.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:09:00):**  What we've done here, and then I'm talking about the Altiplano region north of Granada,  
**[0:09:06-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:09:06):**  we have basically identified a small group of front runner farmers, farmers who are in  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:09:13):**  the almond business, almond production.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:09:17):**  And what we saw there was among this group there were people really good at composting,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:09:24):**  other people were really good at integrated pest management, others were really good at  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:09:29):**  sophisticated green infrastructures to save more water.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:09:32):**  This is a very desert area, very degraded area.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:09:36):**  Almost no soils anymore, about 300 millimeters of rainfall per year.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:09:40):**  So all of these things are really important ingredients of what we would call regenerative  
**[0:09:45-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:09:45):**  agriculture.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:09:47):**  And we found people doing parts of that and what we started to see was that well these  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:09:51):**  people they are doing great stuff but no one knows about it and they don't even know each  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:09:55):**  other.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:09:56):**  So we started to connect them to each other and that group of front runners quickly grew  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:10:03):**  up to about 20 people and 40 people.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:10:07):**  And then we started to do a process with them to develop a long term vision.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:10:14):**  As I said we have a 20 year horizon and what we did with this group was well if you look  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:10:19):**  deep in your heart and you know look into the future so if we think about this same  
**[0:10:24-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:10:24):**  place this trashed semi arid step area highly degraded, you know people have moved to the  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:10:32):**  cities almost no young people there anymore.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:10:34):**  How would you see this evolve over the next 20 years and what can we do to make that happen  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:10:41):**  as a second step?  
**[0:10:42-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:10:42):**  And out of that process what we call a U-curve process it's a methodology that has been developed  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:10:50):**  by Otto Scharmer at the MIT and that's been a super powerful thing and that basically  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:10:56):**  created the basis for our project.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:11:02):**  And the vision was really inspiring actually.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:11:06):**  People well together came up with this future version of this territory that was green where  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:11:17):**  young people have jobs that are sustainable regenerative agriculture has become the norm.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:11:24):**  There is marketing going on of high quality products that actively restore the landscape.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:11:33):**  All of the you know there's great interconnectivity with the cities it's high tech and low tech  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:11:40):**  combined you know there's respect all the sort of these things came out of this and  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:11:46):**  that have sort of been leading of the whole process since then.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:11:50):**  I think this mobilization effort has been really important for the success so far of  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:11:57):**  the project and out of this shared vision well we basically together with these Andalusian  
**[0:12:03-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:12:03):**  farmers developed you know a plan just activities what are we going to do so we are going to  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:12:11):**  promote regenerative farming we are going to develop businesses that have a positive  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:12:16):**  impact on nature and on people we're going to restore degraded natural areas we're going  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:12:22):**  to communicate about this we're going to have inspirational workshops and all that sort  
**[0:12:27-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:12:27):**  of stuff you know and we started doing it and the great thing was that our job was basically  
**[0:12:36-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:12:36):**  that of a catalyst so we helped this emerge out of the local initiative and we sort of  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:12:43):**  helped channel some of the energies and for instance there was one farmer he started to  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:12:49):**  organize composting workshops and those composting workshops they were tremendously popular because  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:12:54):**  you know composting is a thing that directly activates your soil so it becomes fertile  
**[0:13:00-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:13:00):**  again it's cheap to do it's not that complicated and you get financial returns within a year  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:13:07):**  because you know it really can boost your productivity now so we saw more and more of  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:13:12):**  those initiatives emerging and yeah basically what we did was just you know making sure  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:13:17):**  that people were informed about this and connected to it and get out of the way and well so we  
**[0:13:24-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:13:24):**  since then you know several business cases have emerged last year we started a company  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:13:33):**  which is a marketing company for regeneratively produced elements so the 20 farmers have committed  
**[0:13:40-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:13:40):**  to produce for this company and increasingly apply regenerative practices these include  
**[0:13:49-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:13:49):**  composting erosion control water harvesting via green infrastructures like swales they're  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:13:57):**  doing windbreaks all the life that sort of things of course based on a planning for their  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:14:03):**  farms so that's what the farmers committed to and we established basically a marketing  
**[0:14:10-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:14:10):**  company to also get a better return on this product produce and we think that this year  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:14:19):**  well we hope to create the proof in the markets that it's actually possible to not only well  
**[0:14:24-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:14:24):**  restore your land productively but also to create better commercial returns on these  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:14:31):**  regeneratively produced rain fed elements so we'll be at several trade shows this year  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:14:38):**  to promote the project to promote the product well that's just one example the company is  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:14:43):**  called Lao Mendressa well I won't get into too much detail now why that name was chosen  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:14:48):**  but at least it's you know represents basically an integrated form of production where you  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:14:52):**  also not only apply these regenerative practices but also you try and integrate with you know  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:14:58):**  other productive crops like aromatics and honey that you can all do at the same place  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:15:04):**  and that sort of reinforce the ecological functionality of the system and basically  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:15:11):**  so did this this is one of the business cases that we helped establish and yeah so far so  
**[0:15:16-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:15:16):**  good I think a lot has happened over the last years and we really think that this is this  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:15:23):**  has the potential to take off in the upcoming period.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:15:28):**  And it sounds great and if you look at I mean this is a very specific project you have been  
**[0:15:33-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:15:33):**  working on in the last year what has changed at common land I think after probably COP21  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:15:42):**  there's at least I've seen a lot more interest in soil and the role it plays in society and  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:15:48):**  energy and CO2 and water management etc. and have you seen a lot of increased interest  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:15:53):**  and how if so how did that change common land and the structures you've been working on  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:15:58):**  and partners etc.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:16:00):**  Yeah we're obviously super happy with developments in the international climate arena well not  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:16:08):**  the very recent one obviously but you know the COP meetings yeah I think it's a very  
**[0:16:14-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:16:14):**  important step I think it's we are moving out of a niche towards you know large scale  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:16:21):**  appreciation of the importance of this topic and we definitely notice this in our field  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:16:26):**  as well we're also seeing that well for common land nothing much changes as a result of that  
**[0:16:32-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:16:32):**  we're sort of an impact company and impact foundation basically and we will do this regardless  
**[0:16:40-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:16:40):**  of international policy developments because we think it's needed at the same time it definitely  
**[0:16:47-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:16:47):**  helps with the sort of overall consideration for not only climate issues but also the need  
**[0:16:54-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:16:54):**  for integrated approaches like regenerative agriculture I think is probably the most important  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:17:01):**  way to you know capture large quantities of carbon you know saving biodiversity saving  
**[0:17:07-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:17:07):**  soils saving others you know fixing our food problems so that's really key but what we  
**[0:17:17-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:17:17):**  are not really seeing is how it's translating so these policy developments into you know  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:17:28):**  actual support for the type of activities that we're developing so what we're seeing  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:17:33):**  is there is still a big gap between the large committed allocations of you know the hundreds  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:17:39):**  of millions of euros and dollars that have sort of been allocated to tackle the climate  
**[0:17:44-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:17:44):**  change problem and activity in the field we still see there's a big gap there's many investment  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:17:51):**  funds being established that don't reach the initiatives that are there because they are  
**[0:17:56-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:17:56):**  simply not bankable enough so there's sort of still a missing link and of course what  
**[0:18:04-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:18:04):**  we try to do is to make the non-bankable initiatives bankable but to do that you would need you  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:18:11):**  know seed capital or things like that and we are not seeing that that link is being  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:18:16):**  made at a scale large enough I think we really need many more organizations to fill that  
**[0:18:22-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:18:22):**  gap and also the right types of money to make those small initiatives typically but have  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:18:30):**  potential to make them bankable that's my perception of the markets but it may well  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:18:35):**  be that there's initiatives that are missing but I sort of see that as a big commitment  
**[0:18:40-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:18:40):**  big money and small initiatives but you know lack of you know small initiatives can reach  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:18:48):**  scale as a result of what part partially as a result of lacking of finance.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:18:54):**  And when you look at because I completely agree I think there's a lot of money floating  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:18:59):**  or flooding into the space I mean not flooding in terms of water but flooding into the space  
**[0:19:04-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:19:04):**  looking for places to get to work and it turns out to be incredibly difficult to put money  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:19:11):**  to work in the regenerative agriculture space a lot of times they're too small too hidden  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:19:16):**  not bankable yet not coordinated enough to not connect it to the market and so there  
**[0:19:22-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:19:22):**  are many great small pockets of examples but not too many that reach up high enough to  
**[0:19:30-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:19:30):**  reach financing what if you would look a year from now and you had a magic wand what would  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:19:37):**  you do to change that?  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:19:42):**  That's a good one well I think I would probably keep doing what we do that sounds strange  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:19:48):**  but I really think that the solution that we are trying to create makes sense right  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:19:54):**  and the solution from my point of view is or part of it is at least and that's also  
**[0:19:59-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:19:59):**  what we're good at I think is to create the projects that are able to within time absorb  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:20:08):**  bigger finance not because that's the goal per se but it's because it's a requirement  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:20:12):**  in order to create impact at scale so we started with as I refer back to the project I just  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:20:18):**  explained a bit in Spain we started with you know a handful of committed farmers and where  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:20:24):**  we're trying to move to is to well a selection of bankable business cases that are ready  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:20:30):**  to well not necessarily absorb a lot of external finance that could be one of the goals but  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:20:35):**  at least that are solid business that can become solid businesses that are financed  
**[0:20:41-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:20:41):**  with a variety of sources right and we think it's showing that showing that it's possible  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:20:49):**  to basically restore land based on business cases for everybody involved that's probably  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:20:55):**  I think that still is the most important role that we foresee at least for the project side  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:21:01):**  of common land but I think it's really important that for people at the investor side realize  
**[0:21:07-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:21:07):**  this that it's not always you know sufficient to wait until bankable cases emerge I think  
**[0:21:16-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:21:16):**  if you want to create impact it may could make a lot of sense to also to look into the  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:21:24):**  pre-commercial side of business development so for instance last year the element company  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:21:31):**  that we helped establish you know it wasn't there we hired a guy who knows a lot about  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:21:38):**  element marketing and is a great biodynamic farmer so he knows enough about the commercial  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:21:43):**  side and the production side to do this well and we paid him to together with the farmers  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:21:50):**  create a business model and a business plan and that business plan when that was finished  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:21:55):**  it took about half a year to redo that properly based on that the farmers actually asked him  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:22:01):**  to establish this company with them now when the company was established all the farmers  
**[0:22:06-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:22:06):**  they were so committed they put in their own cash to end their own elements to get through  
**[0:22:13-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:22:13):**  the first year so that shows the commitment of these guys  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:22:15):**  basically not having a necessity for outside funding  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:22:20):**  no so they don't they didn't have a necessity for outside funding and our impact investment  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:22:24):**  basically has been that well we paid a few bucks to develop this business plan and to  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:22:30):**  find the right guy to manage the project to manage the business and we're now not even  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:22:35):**  part of it aside from sort of more strategic sparing role and yeah so I don't know if this  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:22:42):**  is good message for impact investors but perhaps if impact is more important than investment  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:22:48):**  well these are definitely opportunities to look into  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:22:53):**  yeah the impact is potentially enormous and I think that we from the impact investing  
**[0:22:58-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:22:58):**  space have to figure out ways to alternative ways of putting money to work and together  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:23:05):**  with in this case local farmers and together in structures that make sense for all stakeholders  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:23:10):**  and not just for the investor so that's a challenge and an opportunity because the same  
**[0:23:15-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:23:15):**  time with some investments a lot of these companies could grow maybe slightly faster  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:23:22):**  or have a bigger impact or do more things than they do because it still costs money  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:23:25):**  but yeah if it's locally available the resources to start I mean there's no obvious need for  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:23:31):**  outside investments of any case or sort  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:23:34):**  well yeah I think that that could be I think that's partly true at the same time I don't  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:23:39):**  want to disencourage anyone I think in this case we as common land we acted basically  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:23:45):**  as a business development support so you could see this initiative more sort of an incubator  
**[0:23:49-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:23:49):**  environment that we created right to help this company well start and become present  
**[0:23:57-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:23:57):**  in the market we can also still participate in it so actually the other members of the  
**[0:24:07-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:24:07):**  company would probably appreciate that and that would obviously provide an investment  
**[0:24:13-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:24:13):**  opportunity for us so it's still it's not an either or but I do think that what I would  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:24:20):**  like to raise the attention to is that it's not well if you want to create impact maybe  
**[0:24:24-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:24:24):**  the pre-commercial side of business development is sometimes well it's often neglected as  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:24:31):**  an important place to create a lot of impact with not too much risk you know the risk is  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:24:36):**  very high but the overall investments are typically low and then you create opportunities  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:24:41):**  to later on in hybrid structures etc still participate in in the businesses you helped  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:24:47):**  create obviously yeah and exactly because especially in this agricultural field where  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:24:52):**  there's not much density of investments right so there's not much innovation like this company  
**[0:24:58-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:24:58):**  is very innovative so to speak for the andalusian reference right it's you know there's not  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:25:05):**  much happening there which provides great opportunity I think if you are slightly better  
**[0:25:09-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:25:09):**  at marketing than everybody else and well in marketing is not a very strongly developed  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:25:17):**  capacity within most agricultural businesses if you move it there's not many producers  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:25:22):**  who know anything about you know consumers for instance well if you have a company that  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:25:25):**  understands consumers and knows about farmers you can combine the two well there's no it's  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:25:30):**  sort of a pond where there's not many else not many other people fishing right so you  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:25:36):**  can create an advantage of being in that place and I think that's what we try to do at common  
**[0:25:41-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:25:41):**  land as well to you know create opportunity because it's very different if you are in  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:25:48):**  silicon valley where you're competing to the next next big everyone around you is doing  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:25:54):**  more or less the same or if you're in in rural Spain where basically nothing's happening  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:25:58):**  still aside from you know big conglomerates and slow moving companies  
**[0:26:03-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:26:03):**  yeah it does it's all about the context and the relativity of your competitors and and  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:26:12):**  if you look just to switch the conversation a bit to what have you been working on and  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:26:18):**  what it kept you busy and maybe even up at night in the last few months and what is or  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:26:23):**  will keep you busy in the next few months just to give a bit of an idea of what you  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:26:27):**  are working on and common land is busy with in this period well I tend to sleep well still  
**[0:26:34-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:26:34):**  I've recently moved moved out of the crying babies period of my life and sort of now the  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:26:43):**  you US government things that are keeping me away but awake sometimes but I'm sort of  
**[0:26:47-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:26:47):**  trying to neglect them of course with the establishing these new companies in the different  
**[0:26:55-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:26:55):**  projects is yeah there's always a lot of things going on so it keeps us busy aside from the  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:27:04):**  like the marketing company for regenerative production that are being established in the  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:27:09):**  different projects at the same time basically so in Australia South Africa and Spain we  
**[0:27:15-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:27:15):**  are developing you know more or less similar concepts in Australia Australian concept wide  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:27:22):**  open agriculture is much bigger than what we're doing in Spain currently probably that's  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:27:29):**  going to have an IPO this year so we're quite stoked about that in South Africa we have  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:27:35):**  established an aromatics company that allows farmers to set aside large pieces of their  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:27:41):**  land for restoration we're very happy that that's also materializing I think it's a great  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:27:46):**  achievement also here we're talking about a very remote area with a number of farmers  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:27:50):**  who have never been in the business before so it's a big transition it's great to see  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:27:54):**  that's happening so those things that are not keeping me awake but they are very you  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:27:58):**  know they're great to be part of basically and especially to see well with all the difficulties  
**[0:28:04-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:28:04):**  that we face that it is possible to make this happen aside from that we are have recently  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:28:11):**  established an impact consultancy company which is called for returns partners with  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:28:17):**  the aim to support companies who want to do something with landscape restoration and with  
**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:28:23):**  regenerative agriculture as an example last year we have established projects with Heineken  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:28:30):**  also in Spain it's a well I'm not sure if I can tell that I can say that that name but  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:28:36):**  there's other brands of course like Carlsberg and stuff but but anyway this beer brewery  
**[0:28:41-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:28:41):**  in southern Spain they wanted us to help them with you know balancing their water use via  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:28:48):**  landscape restoration activities and regenerative agriculture was part of that and so we helped  
**[0:28:54-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:28:54):**  them with developing for restoration projects for each of their breweries in in the in Spain  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:29:01):**  and yeah so that shows that there is increasing interest of big brands also to be involved  
**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:29:07):**  in yeah in regenerative agriculture and that's and sometimes it's really you know you can't  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:29:14):**  really predict where that interest is but it is there and we thought well why not establish  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:29:20):**  a company that sort of caters for that need so those companies who want to do something  
**[0:29:26-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:29:26):**  with this let's help them with you know connecting to the right guy right partners developing  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:29:33):**  the right projects or tying into existing initiatives that they don't know about and  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:29:37):**  sort of advise them on that and that's that's basically what we're doing there and currently  
**[0:29:41-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:29:41):**  that's that's going quite well so we are at this stage connecting with well dredging companies  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:29:49):**  that want to create more added value for their dredging activities quite interesting I never  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:29:54):**  thought of this opportunity but it's of course you know they move around a lot of soil and  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:29:59):**  what do you do with the soil after moving it around well what are the value creation  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:30:04):**  you know potential value creating activities that you can do with that and of course they're  
**[0:30:08-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:30:08):**  called regenerative agriculture is an important well opportunity we're also looking into the  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:30:15):**  palm oil sector we're looking at large-scale agricultural planning activities in Brazil  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:30:22):**  so well all of these are all leads at this stage but we think that we can develop a number  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:30:28):**  of increasing number of projects over the next couple of years so I'm sure that thought  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/30/michiel-de-man/#t=0:30:32):**  that that's something that will keep us busy for the upcoming period as well it sounds

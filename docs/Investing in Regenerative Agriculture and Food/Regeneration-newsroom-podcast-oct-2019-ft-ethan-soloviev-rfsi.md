### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2019-10-04)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:00:00):**  So welcome to a very special episode of the Newsroom podcast.  We are at the Regen Food System Investment Forum here in Oakland and I'm here with Ethan.  So we're back after a few months, a small break we took from the Newsroom podcast and  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:00:15):**  we're going to go over some takeaways that we had during the last two days.  We are literally at the end.  You can hear some background noise.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:00:21):**  People are having some drinks, obviously Cairnsa beer supplied by Patagonia.  So we're at the end of the conference and we're going to look back at what are the key  takeaways from the last two days which were packed with speakers, 175 people in the room  
**[0:00:34-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:00:34):**  all looking at how to invest in this changing food system.  Ethan, what do you take away from this?  There's a couple points I think that are worth exploring.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:00:44):**  One is this really strong sense and Kun, I know you've been following this, but I think  it was the first time it kind of all came together.  This message around regenerative agriculture focusing on nutrients and the nutrient density  
**[0:00:58-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:00:58):**  of food and that that is this reconciler, that is a rallying cry to consumers, to retailers,  to food companies.  You don't even have to mention carbon.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:01:09):**  You don't have to mention climate change.  When you can see that more regenerative food has more nutrients in it, so many things will  shift and there was not just one person, not just two people, but many different angles  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:01:22):**  from the technology of analyzing food to make sure that's actually the case to the research  researchers looking at the overall analysis of how different foods in different places  compare.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:01:33):**  Many different angles coming in to this point of nutritious food from regenerative agriculture  is going to drive the change.  There was not a lot, I guess there was a little bit of doom and gloom for a couple sectors  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:01:47):**  about GMOs and about climate change and everything's going to fall apart, but that was a very minimal  5% problem, 95% solution here.  This thread of nutrients was a really big part.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:02:00):**  Did you see that?  Does it match what you've been hearing?  Was there a conversation that was missing around that or did it all come together from  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:02:07):**  your perspective?  Yeah, I think absolutely the notion of healthy soil leads to healthy produce, leads to healthy  guts and thus healthy people and potentially healthy ecosystems.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:02:16):**  Take it one step further.  It's something that kept coming back.  It's one of the subsectors I love to focus on more.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:02:21):**  I haven't done enough interviews in it because simply I haven't found enough companies and  funders and investors looking at this space.  I've recorded one which hopefully when this goes live, goes live very soon with Teak Origin.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:02:32):**  I will link it below, which I think is going to blow your mind if you're listening to this  because it's a lot worse than we thought and a lot more potential than we thought as well.  We had then Kittredge here in the room, which I've interviewed before as well, the Bioregenerative  
**[0:02:45-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:02:45):**  Food Association and really all the way up from Danone to a general farmer, regenerative  farmer in the room, everybody keeps coming back to that.  I think it's something that crosses politics lines.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:03:00):**  It's something that if it's good for you and your children, it's something you probably  want to buy.  Maybe even a premium, that's something we're going to discuss, we're going to see in the  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:03:10):**  market, but if it's at the same price level or more or less the same price level, who  would want to say no to that?  I think there's a very strong argument.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:03:18):**  It could be one of the keys.  We have to see if the consumer cares, if the companies are going to share this data, if  the technology is really going to work at scale that we need it, and if the databases  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:03:27):**  are going to tell us this is a good apple versus a bad one.  There's a lot of if, if, if, but I have the feeling that a year from now, if it's October  2020, we'll have a very different conversation about nutrient density.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:03:38):**  It's very exciting.  It came back in almost every panel.  I think one thing that was missing, just hearing you say that, is there wasn't a huge amount  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:03:46):**  of focus on biodiversity, and I think that is a gap that maybe we can fill in upcoming  podcasts and maybe in future events like this one coming up.  Just like you said, no one can say no to nutrient density.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:04:01):**  I think biodiversity is also something that everyone has a hard time saying no to.  What CEO or CFO, what person could say, yeah, I'd really like for there to be more extinction  of species happening.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:04:13):**  Yeah, and I think with the extension rebellion protests that are happening constantly and  should and will happen much more, and with books coming out of Wilding, like I did an  interview with Isabella Tree.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:04:26):**  Of course, she's called Tree, and she's actually on a book tour right now in the US.  Her book got published here.  I think we're going to hit a momentum with biodiversity, and we're going to probably  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:04:33):**  find out just with nutrients, it's a lot worse than we thought, and there's a lot more potential,  and a lot more potential when you do things right for stuff to come back very quickly,  but also in very surprising ways and surprising places that you didn't expect biodiversity  
**[0:04:47-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:04:47):**  to bounce back.  Right, and I think from the consumer packaged goods angle, there was just a huge announcement  that came out last week from Emmanuel Faber, CEO of Danone, on biodiversity, and I think  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:05:00):**  it was $18 or $19 trillion worth of companies were basically saying, we support biodiversity  at all scales, or not that we would like to support.  We don't necessarily know if we are right now.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:05:13):**  Do we have the right tools to track our supply chain and see what we're currently doing?  Maybe not, but we really want to, and we really think it's a good idea, and you should all  get on board with us.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:05:22):**  Yeah, and I think that's something we've seen a few of those companies here, but we definitely  could see more.  I mean, there were massive companies part of this announcement, and at the same time,  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:05:33):**  they don't really know what they're talking about, and they haven't probably talked with  their farmers, and we don't know how far we can push it.  I think the most regenerative farmers are still maybe halfway through what they could  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:05:44):**  do if they really, really get the chance, if they get the right finance, if they get  the right off-take agreements, and if we actually pay for what we get from these amazing farmers.  I think we're going to be very surprised of how much biodiversity actually can come back  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:05:57):**  on farmland that produces food, a lot of food, instead of just looking at farm versus nature,  put a big fence, and hope for the best.  One thing, kind of key takeaway from the last couple days here at the Regenerative Food  
**[0:06:10-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:06:10):**  Systems Investment Forum was talking about all of the farmers who aren't doing that yet,  the large number of farmers that are still coming from an extractive paradigm, and how  to support them, really support them towards better quality of life, towards economic resilience,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:06:31):**  towards not being backed up against the ropes or backed up against the wall with the mounting  debt, with everything they have.  I know that in this show in the past, I have sometimes been critical of folks out there  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:06:45):**  in the community who are saying regenerative agriculture, but doing what, in my opinion,  is very functional, reducing harm, using less chemical inputs, and calling that regenerative.  I think one thing that was very interesting in getting to meet some of these people here  
**[0:07:03-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:07:03):**  is that all of them had, as an explicit strategy, not that this was their long-term goal, was  to reduce inputs a little bit, all of them had, as an explicit strategy, a kind of quiet,  regenerative Trojan horse idea, where getting in with farmers on cost savings, on maybe  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:07:26):**  some price premiums, is really just a way to connect, to build relationship, and to  get ready for a deeper transformation that can happen in nutrient density, in biodiversity,  in shifting whole farming systems.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:07:40):**  There's an explicit understanding here that while we may externally be focused on the  kind of functional, quick, reduce harm, make more efficient steps, that at least what I'm  hearing is that is an appetizer for a more delicious meal that we can all create together  
**[0:07:59-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:07:59):**  through a deeper shift to regenerative agriculture.  Yeah, and I think that the most important piece of that is actually building trust.  Farmers have been lied to, cheated forever, basically, and we heard a lot of examples  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:08:13):**  here of farmers, of actually a big issue being non-independent agronomic advice, and basically  getting your advice from somebody that's also selling you the chemical packages, obviously  is not going to lead to the optimal chemical package, whatever side of the aisle you come  
**[0:08:28-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:08:28):**  from.  So building that trust and seeing that you lead to immediate results is something that  probably applies to a lot more farmers, and a big chunk of those, and I think we know  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:08:40):**  quite a few of the regenerative farmers have been doing this for a long, long time.  All of them have gone through a massive personal change, but it's not what they started with.  They probably started because they were against the wall and they couldn't buy any inputs  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:08:53):**  anymore.  The only thing they could afford was a few cover crops.  We know examples of that.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:08:57):**  And if we, let's hope they not all have to be pushed against the wall before they make  that change, we can actually invite them and nudge them into step by step and see the changes  that are possible, and who knows, 10 years down the line, they will be here sharing a  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:09:09):**  very personal transformation story, and we'll be all very happy and they write a book, et  cetera.  And we'll have 10,000 of those to really have that change.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:09:18):**  To wrap up, is there anything else you want to share, or do we go to upcoming events?  Just one last thought and just kind of reflection from being here.  This was an incredible community gathering.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:09:31):**  Like Koen said, 175 people all together.  There was a real sense of this group, even though they're coming from all sides of the  world, meeting up here, there's a real sense of like a little seed of something that is  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:09:46):**  going to grow.  Lots of potential, lots of optimism, investors of many scales who are here, excited about  investing, have already invested, want to do more, want to figure out larger ways to  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:09:59):**  mobilize capital to get into the space.  How do we do that together?  A lot of energy moving in this direction.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:10:06):**  So it feels like just the start.  There was a great moment at the final panel with Tina Owens from Danone and Gina Sudegone  from Applegate and Chesray Asad from Food System Six.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:10:21):**  But Tina Owens asked everyone, just straight up, asked to the room.  She said, how many of you, given the work that we've done together, given what you've  heard in the last two days, how many of you think that regenerative agriculture is going  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:10:37):**  to go away in 10 years?  That in 10 years it just won't even be a thing.  You won't even hear about it.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:10:42):**  If you think that's the case, raise your hand.  And we'll wait for you.  Go ahead.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:10:47):**  We're waiting, waiting.  Nobody in the room raised their hand.  There's a real clarity that this is here and will grow.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:10:54):**  Yeah, I completely agree.  But let's wrap it up.  Let's see what's upcoming.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:11:00):**  I have one thing to put in your calendars if you listen to this.  It's called Terra Madre, which is the main two-year.  Every two years Slow Food organizes in Turin, northern Italy, their main event.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:11:10):**  It's a food show.  It's a huge activist movement.  And we are going to add a finance part to that.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:11:16):**  So come if you're interested in any type of good, clean and fair food, come.  It's October 8th until 12th, 2020, Turin, northern Italy, Terra Madre.  So have that in your calendar.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:11:26):**  But we also have a few events that are a bit closer to the date.  Just at the end of this month, at the end of October, is the Regenerative Earth Summit  in Colorado.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:11:35):**  This is a great event.  A number of larger food producers and fashion companies and regenerative agriculture farmers  and NGOs will be there.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/10/regeneration-newsroom-podcast-ft-ethan-soloviev-october-2019-rfsi/#t=0:11:47):**  It's a great place to continue the conversation that started at this event.

**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:00:14):**  Why is a 1.3 trillion dollar asset manager asking questions about soil health?

**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:00:22):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:00:26):**  planet mattered.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:00:28):**  Today I'm going to show you how to learn more about how to put money to work in regenerative  
**[0:00:35-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:00:35):**  agriculture.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:00:44):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:00:48):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:00:50):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:00:55):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:01:00):**  In March last year, we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:01:26):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:01:29):**  Today I'm joined by Jasmine Swan, sustainability analyst at legal and general investment management,  
**[0:01:34-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:01:34):**  one of the largest asset managers in Europe with over 1.3 trillion assets under management.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:01:41):**  And we're going to explore why a large asset manager is asking questions about soil health  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:01:46):**  and how they are trying to influence the companies they invest in.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:01:49):**  Welcome Jasmine.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:01:50):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:01:51):**  Thank you very much for having me.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:01:52):**  And could you describe a bit for the audience that's not so familiar with, let's say the  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:01:57):**  institutional finance world, what legal and general is and what they represent and how  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:02:02):**  they work or how you work?  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:02:04):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:02:05):**  So Algym or legal and general investment management, we are the asset management arm of legal and  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:02:11):**  general group, which is a FTSE 100 company based here in Europe.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:02:15):**  We also have offices in US, Hong Kong and Tokyo.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:02:20):**  And as you mentioned, we are one of the largest European asset managers and a global investor.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:02:26):**  And we work with both institutional and retail clients offering them strategies across the  
**[0:02:33-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:02:33):**  full spectrum of asset classes, including equities, bonds, real assets, as well as multi-alpha  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:02:40):**  strategies and liability driven investments.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:02:44):**  And I sit in the corporate governance team here at Algym, which is responsible for our  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:02:49):**  stewardship activities.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:02:50):**  So essentially as a major shareholder, we have a responsibility to engage with companies  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:02:56):**  on behalf of our clients assets that we look after to engage with the companies in our  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:01):**  portfolio to ensure that they are appropriately managing key material risks, such as climate  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:07):**  change.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:08):**  And that takes up a big part of my role.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:11):**  You mentioned climate change.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:12):**  I mean, I think, and I hope, and I imagine it's on the agenda of all asset managers,  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:17):**  all institutional players that are managing large portfolios.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:21):**  But then we got introduced actually through Andrew of Soil Capital who mentioned there's  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:26):**  an asset manager that's actually asking questions about soil health.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:30):**  So how did it come about that within your risk discussions, within the discussions you  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:35):**  have with these companies that you're starting to ask questions about soil health, which  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:40):**  is very specific and very particular, obviously not on this podcast, but in, I think the asset  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:44):**  owner and the institutional world quite a bit.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:47):**  It is.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:48):**  And I've definitely had people say to me that it sounds like an investor getting a bit too  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:54):**  far into the weeds.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:56):**  No pun intended.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:03:58):**  But the reason why we look at soil health is that, as I mentioned, we believe that climate  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:04:03):**  change is one of, if not the most significant risk facing the global economy.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:04:09):**  And then in turn, our clients assets in the medium to long term.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:04:14):**  And why soil?  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:04:16):**  Because improving soil health is really one of the key levers that the world has to pull  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:04:21):**  in order to tackle climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:04:26):**  So when we look at climate change and the food companies in our portfolio, we see a  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:04:32):**  really big challenge for the industry, which is that in order to meet the demands of a  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:04:37):**  1.5 degree Celsius trajectory by 2050, the world needs to be able to feed a population  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:04:44):**  ballooning to 10 billion people, all the while reducing our agricultural emissions by two  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:04:51):**  thirds and doing all of this without expanding agricultural land by even so much as a square  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:04:57):**  foot.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:05:00):**  And linking all of this back to soil health, if you're a global food company, right now  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:05:05):**  you have a problem in the sense that your supply chain is likely climate negative.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:05:10):**  You'll be sourcing, though often indirectly of course, from farms which deforest and douse  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:05:17):**  the soil with chemicals.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:05:20):**  And if you want to make sure that your company is actually aligning itself with a well below  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:05:24):**  two degree trajectory and that your supply chain is resilient in a world grappling with  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:05:30):**  both the transitional and the physical risks and impact of climate change, which indeed  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:05:36):**  a lot of food companies have actually committed themselves to doing, then working with your  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:05:40):**  suppliers as a global food company to improve soil health should be really one of the key  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:05:45):**  components of your strategy.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:05:48):**  So that's the why soil, essentially.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:05:50):**  No, I think it's great to hear that coming from one of the large asset owners, as I think  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:05:56):**  on this podcast and the people listening, they understand the why, but they haven't  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:05:59):**  seen it so well, let's say, structured and mentioned in the mainstream financial sector.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:06:06):**  So how has been the response when you go to the major food companies that are in your  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:06:11):**  portfolios and in the different strategies and the different mandates you manage?  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:06:16):**  How has been the response when you put your soil questions on the table?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:06:20):**  So I'll start with giving some context around our engagement work.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:06:25):**  So we do not engage on behalf of sort of a specific fund or a specific strategy, but  
**[0:06:31-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:06:31):**  rather the engagement work that we do is run centralized from the corporate governance  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:06:39):**  team that I sit in.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:06:41):**  So our team is engaging on behalf of all of our 1.3 trillion in assets.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:06:48):**  But the response and yeah, the response is a good question.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:06:51):**  So it's really dependent on the companies that we speak with.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:06:57):**  So we engage with about 10 to 15 of the world's largest global packaged food manufacturers.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:07:07):**  And I will say in some meetings with food companies, they are already way ahead of us.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:07:13):**  They can explain to us exactly what they're doing and how they're thinking about this  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:07:16):**  and what they're investing and what the programs look like and how they're working with suppliers  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:07:22):**  and the kind of targets that they're setting themselves.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:07:26):**  And it's very clear that they have a very sort of sophisticated, robust understanding  
**[0:07:31-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:07:31):**  of this issue and the risks and that they have a robust plan in place to try and tackle  
**[0:07:38-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:07:38):**  it.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:07:39):**  And then we speak with some companies where they've appreciated that soil health is a  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:07:44):**  key risk for them to manage and they're beginning to look at it and implement a strategy, but  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:07:49):**  it's much more sort of early days.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:07:51):**  And then with other companies, it's much more early and it's viewed as a sort of, then on  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:07:59):**  the other end of the spectrum for other companies, they've really not started looking at this  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:04):**  topic.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:05):**  It doesn't seem like it's something that's yet on their radar.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:11):**  And I think we've had some companies be quite surprised actually that we're going into so  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:15):**  much depth on this topic.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:18):**  So the range of responses has been quite varied to be honest.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:21):**  And when you look at that group of, let's say the 15 largest food companies, like the  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:25):**  pioneers, is that a group of 10?  
**[0:08:28-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:28):**  Is that a group of two or three?  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:29):**  Obviously you don't have to name them or mention them, but what is more or less the breakdown  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:34):**  of the different responses we've seen so far from the pioneers, the interested ones and  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:38):**  the very surprised ones?  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:39):**  Is that a nice one, two, three, like a divided in three, or do you see quite a few pioneers  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:46):**  for instance?  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:47):**  I'd say it's a relatively even...  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:49):**  So we have, I'd say there are about four or five companies that are really pioneering  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:54):**  this and already have robust strategies in place.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:08:57):**  And then I'd say there's about maybe five or six, seven companies where it's much more  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:09:03):**  early days and they've really not started thinking about this in a holistic way yet.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:09:10):**  And then the rest is somewhere in the middle on that journey, I would say.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:09:15):**  And when you engage and have those discussions, what do you ask from them?  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:09:19):**  Let's say they don't have this holistic view and they don't have this set of what they're  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:09:22):**  measuring, et cetera.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:09:23):**  What do you ask from a company in this engagement, what they should report or would you like  
**[0:09:29-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:09:29):**  to see from them?  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:09:30):**  Sure.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:09:31):**  So yeah, so we tend to couch it in this language that you just said that we want them to demonstrate  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:09:39):**  to us that they're looking at climate mitigation and resilience from a holistic perspective  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:09:43):**  and really recognizing that meeting the Paris Agreement will need to make significant changes  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:09:49):**  to the ways that we produce and source food.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:09:52):**  So the way this would manifest is that, for example, we'll look for companies and ask  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:09:58):**  companies that in their sustainability or in their annual reports, preferably, that  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:10:04):**  they should be discussing the risks to their business associated with soil health.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:10:08):**  So for example, we look for them to discuss how deteriorating soil health threatens agricultural  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:10:15):**  resilience.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:10:16):**  It threatens the soil's resilience to drought and in turn crop productivity and then what  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:10:22):**  the implications of all of this is for the business and its supply chain.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:10:27):**  And conversely, we also ask companies to also discuss the opportunities piece.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:10:33):**  So on the flip side, looking for companies to also recognize that the opportunity that  
**[0:10:42-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:10:42):**  improving soil health presents to them, because as I said before, currently their supply chains  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:10:49):**  are very likely climate negative, whereas improving soil health provides a means for  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:10:56):**  your company and your wider supply chain to offer a climate solution in the sense that  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:11:01):**  improving soil health means improving the soil's capacity for agricultural carbon sequestration.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:11:07):**  And since when have you, let me ask two questions in one, since when have you been asking or  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:11:13):**  having these dialogues and conversations and have you seen large shifts already, maybe  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:11:19):**  in the responses, maybe also in disclosure?  
**[0:11:22-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:11:22):**  Have you seen changes basically since the moment, maybe not all, obviously, your positive  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:11:28):**  impact because the whole world starts to slowly wake up to soil health, but definitely part  
**[0:11:32-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:11:32):**  of that is your impact because you're discussing that with these companies.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:11:35):**  Have you seen, since you started changes in responses, in disclosures, have you seen positive  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:11:41):**  changes of the involvement you've made?  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:11:43):**  Let me just add one more thing to the other question that you asked, because I think it's  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:11:48):**  relevant and then I'll answer this question.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:11:52):**  So another thing that we also ask companies for in our engagements with them is whether  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:11:59):**  they have a view on what percentage of their, at least their direct sourcing that is compliant  
**[0:12:05-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:12:05):**  with the standard laid out in the EU green taxonomy on agriculture, which of course lays  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:12:12):**  out measures to improve soil health.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:12:14):**  And we're very open in our engagements with companies saying that we understand that the  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:12:20):**  EU taxonomy is very new.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:12:23):**  It was only released this past summer, but over time, this is a metric that we would  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:12:29):**  expect food companies to start to measure.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:12:31):**  Yeah, I had a discussion with Andrew, I think just after the summer on, actually we did  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:12:38):**  a short interview on the taxonomy and why it matters, not only for European investors,  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:12:42):**  but actually for the whole sector and for investors all around the world.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:12:46):**  It's very interesting.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:12:47):**  It's quite surprising how detailed and how far it goes on soil health and that it managed  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:12:53):**  to get into the taxonomy.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:12:55):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:12:56):**  And I think it's really encouraging because I think to date, there's not really been,  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:13:02):**  we've not really had sort of an official framework to define what good looks like in terms of  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:13:07):**  agricultural sourcing.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:13:08):**  So in that sense, I think it is very, very, very helpful.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:13:11):**  All right.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:13:12):**  Can you, sorry, can you remind me again what the next question was?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:13:17):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:13:18):**  So since when have you been engaging on, I mean, on climate change obviously for a long  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:13:22):**  time, but on soil health specifically, and have you seen large or have you seen changes,  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:13:28):**  hopefully large, but have you seen changes, positive changes in that period until now  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:13:32):**  basically the beginning of 2020?  
**[0:13:35-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:13:35):**  So we, in 2019, we did a review of the methodology that we use to assess food companies on climate  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:13:46):**  change.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:13:47):**  And as a part of that review, we met with a number of expert stakeholders including  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:13:55):**  Andrew from, from Soil Capital, but also other NGOs and external experts.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:02):**  And so this summer we, on the back of that, we produced a new and revamp assessment framework,  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:09):**  which includes these new metrics on soil health.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:13):**  And then on the back of this assessment framework, we, for the 2019 engagement cycle with food  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:21):**  companies that is just coming to a close now that we've held the meetings that we've held  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:27):**  during the autumn.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:28):**  This is.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:29):**  It's super fresh basically.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:31):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:32):**  So, so yeah, so on the back of that assessment framework, we, we then set up meetings with  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:38):**  companies and have started introducing these metrics in our, in our conversations with  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:43):**  them and started to ask them to, to report against them.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:46):**  So it's, it's very, very new.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:48):**  So I can't say credit for, for any, any new publications that we've seen or sort of any  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:53):**  new commitments that we've seen from, from companies because we've only just started  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:14:57):**  engaging on this topic in the past six months or so.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:15:01):**  But I think certainly in the past year we have seen a change in the level of sophistication  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:15:10):**  in terms of climate reporting from food companies and in terms of how companies are reporting  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:15:17):**  on the different aspects of their climate strategies, which certainly include soil health.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:15:22):**  And I think that has a lot to do with the fact that investors, including Algem are simply  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:15:29):**  just expecting a higher standard from, from food companies.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:15:33):**  It's, you know, I think previously the food industry has been able to fly a little bit  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:15:38):**  under the radar in terms of climate change because investors have been focused on oil  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:15:43):**  and gas, electric utilities, coal, and so on.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:15:48):**  And now I think both investors and food companies are coming to the realization that, you know,  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:15:54):**  food is, you know, I don't want to say food is the new oil and gas, but it certainly climate  
**[0:15:58-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:15:58):**  change is a key material risk for the sector and as such we are seeing, I think an improvement  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:16:06):**  in disclosures in this area.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:16:08):**  Yes, I think a lot of the latest reports of the UN and of the climate committees, et cetera,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:16:14):**  really, really showed that without food, obviously oil and gas and energy, but without food and  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:16:21):**  the agriculture sector, we're simply not going to make it.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:16:23):**  We're not going to get to the one and a half degrees or stay under two.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:16:27):**  And I think slowly that realization comes that there's this huge sector that, that needs  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:16:32):**  to be changed and quite fundamentally, and it's a very complex and a very big one and  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:16:37):**  it's not going to be an easy journey, but there are interesting, let's say, streets  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:16:41):**  or angles to take to, and one of them obviously is improving soil health.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:16:47):**  And are you planning, let's say for the outside world, maybe not people that maybe are not  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:16:53):**  directly customers, maybe indirectly they are clients.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:16:56):**  Maybe indirectly they are investing through you.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:16:59):**  But are you planning to release certain things, reports, case studies of this engagement?  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:05):**  How does that work normally with the engagement?  
**[0:17:08-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:08):**  I think it's not so public.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:10):**  Are there certain pieces that are going to be public maybe in 2020?  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:12):**  Are you planning to release something to the outside world on the work on soil health that  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:17):**  you've been doing?  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:19):**  So every year the way our engagements work is that we run our analysis on companies and  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:24):**  then we have meetings with them to discuss the areas that we have identified as being  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:30):**  areas where they can go further or they could improve.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:34):**  And then for those companies where after a significant period of engagement, we don't  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:38):**  really see action, we don't see the companies moving further on the areas that we have identified,  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:44):**  those companies are subject to a vote against their chair at the company's next AGM and  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:50):**  the company is also excluded from our ESG range of funds.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:55):**  And in conjunction with this announcement of the divested companies and the companies  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:17:59):**  where we're voting against, we always produce a report summarizing our engagements with  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:18:05):**  companies and the themes that we're seeing.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:18:09):**  And we also make a point of while we're divesting companies and we're voting against the chair  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:18:14):**  if we don't see action on climate change, we also make a really big point of also naming  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:18:19):**  and faming the companies that we see as setting best practice and setting an example for their  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:18:26):**  peers and being in the vanguard of climate change.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:18:30):**  And so that report is a really good opportunity for us to highlight things like soil health,  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:18:36):**  to highlight the food companies that are working on measures to improve soil health, working  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:18:42):**  with their supply chain to really think holistically around the climate impact and the soil health  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:18:49):**  impact of their supply chain.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:18:51):**  Yeah, I want to wrap up this interview, I think to be conscious of your time as well.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:18:56):**  And it's a subject we don't hear too much about normally, at least on this podcast,  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:19:02):**  as we mostly discuss farms and farmers and direct investments, et cetera.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:19:06):**  But obviously there's a gigantic financial sector world and financial institution, institutional  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:19:12):**  investor world out there that is slowly also starting to move after a lot of work you've  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:19:18):**  been doing on climate change, oil and gas, like you mentioned before, on energy.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:19:22):**  And slowly soil health becomes more and more of a topic.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:19:25):**  And I think it's extremely interesting to see that and to see the big oil tankers, pun  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:19:29):**  intended, to slowly start changing course slightly.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:19:32):**  And we see sometimes in the news, the big food companies that make certain claims and  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:19:36):**  statements, but it's good to see they're actually people trying to check if they're doing that  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:19:40):**  and to see and to get certain things disclosed as we have been doing with carbon and have  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:19:45):**  been doing with other things.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:19:46):**  Slowly soil starts to become more important.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:19:49):**  So thank you for your work and thank you for taking the time to explain something quite  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:19:53):**  complicated to a podcast audience.

**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:20:50):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:20:54):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:20:58):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:21:00):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:21:04):**  to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:21:09):**  these podcasts since 2016.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:21:11):**  We thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:22:08):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/31/yasmine-svan/#t=0:22:10):**  Meaning, I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.

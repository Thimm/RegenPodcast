**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:19):**  To learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil people local communities and ecosystems  while making an appropriate and fair return  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:33):**  have their roots in how we treat our land grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as  Investors big and small and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt soil underneath our feet  Before we get started  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:47):**  I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I will definitely continue to do so  And release about an episode a month  But at the same time I would love to take this further share more interviews

**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:30):**  Today i'm talking to amelic young and joseph sagata of quadia capital an investment manager based in geneva switzerland who invested over  150 million into impact companies projects and funds so I can start and just to  To let you know that before working at quadia. I was working  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:46):**  around 20 years on capital markets and the trading room  Mainly on the structuring side. So it was really about looking for solutions  and in 2007 what happened we we we had the crisis food crisis with  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:02):**  Pricing going up for all the food and more and more private equity  fans came to to  To my desk to my team to switch a solution about buying land and produce food because it was clear that  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:16):**  population growing  Pricing going up. It was a key investment 10 years ago  And on my side, I just found out that  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:25):**  Having a quantitative solution, which is just producing more food is not sustainable  And it's a short-term view about a solution that we should implement and step by step still working  At banking I met a lot of people about agriculture  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:42):**  Local food regenerative agriculture. I do think that the solution and I started to be passionate about  quality instead of quantity  Logistic instead of just a linear economy where you are producing on the new waste and  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:58):**  I started to to to think that we should bring investment to all this new entrepreneur  Who are reinventing the food system and that's what i'm doing now?  And when you really look at what we need today and and what's going on  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:14):**  A big waste of energy is in the food system. Just all the oil you can  Use and need for growing  The food then the logistic and transporting food from one place to all around the world  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:29):**  Is a big waste of of energy  And then we have the food  Waste of energy  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:40):**  Yeah, of course so  after 2007  I lived 2008 on the banking I mentioned before I was at Lehman Brothers  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:49):**  So it was really in London at the trading room at my desk leaving the crisis. So it was not so easy, but  Wow, you were in the first row. Yeah exactly  The Fedness Monday in September  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:02):**  But um for me it was not really sad finally because for one year I was already interested by something else  So I had this passion about how?  To bring solutions this time not just through derivatives or pricing but really on the feed with uh with entrepreneurs  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:22):**  First you you have to know and I do think you know this when you are talking with people or  classical investors or bankers about  uh social and environmental finance  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:34):**  or impact investing you have this  um  Thought that it will not be liquid it will be with a low return  
**[0:04:43-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:43):**  Or just an emerging market with high risk and sometimes not really professional doing this kind of investment more as a hobby  Yeah, yeah five years ago. It was really  The case what we did with Norita is just  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:57):**  uh trying to find foreign investors raise is comfort zone  and the comfort zone it's not for investing too long and  Having a clear view on the potential return. So we build this program by bringing diversification  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:14):**  for the investors and the key was  investing for four years targeting a four percent  annual return  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:23):**  And already some cash flow after two years and three years. So when you invest 100 the Norita program is giving you back  25 after two years  70  
**[0:05:34-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:34):**  After three years and full redemption after four years. So for a lot of investors, it made sense to have diversification  uh, I would say in real economy and in their portfolio and they knew that the return and and and  The timeline of the return was really clear. So, um  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:54):**  It's what we call the comfort zone of the investors for them. Not thinking that it's  Too much risky at the beginning and that liquidity piece like it's very unclear in many cases  Because it's such a long-term transition the food system when it's coming back. So tackling that one is is  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:12):**  Absolutely key and how are you doing that?  How do you make sure that after two years or four years already?  And most of the money or after four years all of the money plus the return came back  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:25):**  So we're structuring it in a way that we are only investing in debt in this program  So we more or less half of the portfolio a little bit more is  Allocated in direct loans to uh to young companies normally looking for working capital  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:41):**  Funding so in growth phases where of course the banks are an alternative, but they need  uh, sometimes quicker capital and  And also partners that understand the business and their their needs in terms of network and where they are going at  
**[0:06:56-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:56):**  and  The the rest of the portfolio is actually allocated to debt funds which give this liquidity  Component too and of course the the way we structure the loans and the repayments  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:09):**  match the the cash flows that we want to  Obtain and reimburse to to investors. So the whole pack  Allows us to to structure it in a way  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:19):**  that  Capital repayment is possible from year two onwards  So it's roughly a one-year period investment and over the four-year  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:29):**  Horizon of the of the vehicle another specificity we have is we are doing index debt  Index debt and index debt means that you are not discussing an interest rate with the entrepreneur what you explain is you just need  A risk premium and the entrepreneur must pay back the debt with this risk premium  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:48):**  For example could be 20 percent for three years or three years and a half  Which is the maximum maturity we we are doing for our four years program  And it just means that the the entrepreneur  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:01):**  Is borrowing 100 at the beginning and for one year there is no  Cash flow so he can really grow his company. We don't need some cash back for the first year  But after one year every six months, he will pay back a percentage of  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:18):**  His gross sales. So it means if the company is is more successful that  What we checked on the business plan instead of three or three point five years  They will be able to redeem after two years and it will be a high return for us  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:32):**  But it's a high return you are doing  Thanks to the company's success not because you were negotiating at the beginning high interest rate  So by by doing this way a lot of entrepreneur understand that perhaps  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:46):**  The price of capital would be higher, but it's always cheaper than equity  But could be higher than just interest rate  Just interest rate, but they are happy to share this because it's higher because they are more successful  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:02):**  It's also a way for us to screen companies to see how how they advanced and why not consider an equity investment in the future  So it's also a learning curve for our investors starting with Noritare their comfort zone  comfortable program and now ready to go to more private equity deals because they are confident in in  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:27):**  Our expertise and the companies we are bringing for investment  You just listened to the summary of the interview for the full-length interview.

**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:26):**  while making an appropriate and fair return  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:28):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:33):**  have their roots in how we treat our land grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as  
**[0:00:38-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:38):**  Investors big and small and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt soil underneath our feet  
**[0:00:46-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:46):**  Before we get started

**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:00:52):**  And release about an episode a month

**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:30):**  Today i'm talking to amelic young and joseph sagata of quadia capital an investment manager based in geneva switzerland who invested over  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:37):**  150 million into impact companies projects and funds so I can start and just to  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:42):**  To let you know that before working at quadia. I was working  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:46):**  around 20 years on capital markets and the trading room  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:51):**  Mainly on the structuring side. So it was really about looking for solutions  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:01:55):**  and in 2007 what happened we we we had the crisis food crisis with  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:02):**  Pricing going up for all the food and more and more private equity  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:07):**  fans came to to  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:10):**  To my desk to my team to switch a solution about buying land and produce food because it was clear that  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:16):**  population growing  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:17):**  Pricing going up. It was a key investment 10 years ago  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:22):**  And on my side, I just found out that  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:25):**  Having a quantitative solution, which is just producing more food is not sustainable  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:31):**  And it's a short-term view about a solution that we should implement and step by step still working  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:38):**  At banking I met a lot of people about agriculture  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:42):**  Local food regenerative agriculture. I do think that the solution and I started to be passionate about  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:50):**  quality instead of quantity  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:52):**  Logistic instead of just a linear economy where you are producing on the new waste and  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:02:58):**  I started to to to think that we should bring investment to all this new entrepreneur  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:05):**  Who are reinventing the food system and that's what i'm doing now?  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:08):**  And when you really look at what we need today and and what's going on  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:14):**  A big waste of energy is in the food system. Just all the oil you can  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:19):**  Use and need for growing  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:22):**  The food then the logistic and transporting food from one place to all around the world  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:29):**  Is a big waste of of energy  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:33):**  And then we have the food  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:35):**  Waste of energy  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:40):**  Yeah, of course so  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:42):**  after 2007  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:45):**  I lived 2008 on the banking I mentioned before I was at Lehman Brothers  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:49):**  So it was really in London at the trading room at my desk leaving the crisis. So it was not so easy, but  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:03:56):**  Wow, you were in the first row. Yeah exactly  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:00):**  The Fedness Monday in September  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:02):**  But um for me it was not really sad finally because for one year I was already interested by something else  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:08):**  So I had this passion about how?  
**[0:04:11-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:11):**  To bring solutions this time not just through derivatives or pricing but really on the feed with uh with entrepreneurs  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:22):**  First you you have to know and I do think you know this when you are talking with people or  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:28):**  classical investors or bankers about  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:30):**  uh social and environmental finance  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:34):**  or impact investing you have this  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:36):**  um  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:37):**  Thought that it will not be liquid it will be with a low return  
**[0:04:43-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:43):**  Or just an emerging market with high risk and sometimes not really professional doing this kind of investment more as a hobby  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:51):**  Yeah, yeah five years ago. It was really  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:55):**  The case what we did with Norita is just  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:04:57):**  uh trying to find foreign investors raise is comfort zone  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:03):**  and the comfort zone it's not for investing too long and  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:07):**  Having a clear view on the potential return. So we build this program by bringing diversification  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:14):**  for the investors and the key was  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:18):**  investing for four years targeting a four percent  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:22):**  annual return  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:23):**  And already some cash flow after two years and three years. So when you invest 100 the Norita program is giving you back  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:31):**  25 after two years  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:33):**  70  
**[0:05:34-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:34):**  After three years and full redemption after four years. So for a lot of investors, it made sense to have diversification  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:43):**  uh, I would say in real economy and in their portfolio and they knew that the return and and and  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:50):**  The timeline of the return was really clear. So, um  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:05:54):**  It's what we call the comfort zone of the investors for them. Not thinking that it's  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:00):**  Too much risky at the beginning and that liquidity piece like it's very unclear in many cases  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:06):**  Because it's such a long-term transition the food system when it's coming back. So tackling that one is is  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:12):**  Absolutely key and how are you doing that?  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:14):**  How do you make sure that after two years or four years already?  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:17):**  And most of the money or after four years all of the money plus the return came back  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:25):**  So we're structuring it in a way that we are only investing in debt in this program  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:30):**  So we more or less half of the portfolio a little bit more is  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:34):**  Allocated in direct loans to uh to young companies normally looking for working capital  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:41):**  Funding so in growth phases where of course the banks are an alternative, but they need  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:46):**  uh, sometimes quicker capital and  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:49):**  And also partners that understand the business and their their needs in terms of network and where they are going at  
**[0:06:56-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:56):**  and  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:06:57):**  The the rest of the portfolio is actually allocated to debt funds which give this liquidity  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:04):**  Component too and of course the the way we structure the loans and the repayments  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:09):**  match the the cash flows that we want to  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:11):**  Obtain and reimburse to to investors. So the whole pack  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:16):**  Allows us to to structure it in a way  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:19):**  that  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:20):**  Capital repayment is possible from year two onwards  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:24):**  So it's roughly a one-year period investment and over the four-year  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:29):**  Horizon of the of the vehicle another specificity we have is we are doing index debt  
**[0:07:35-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:35):**  Index debt and index debt means that you are not discussing an interest rate with the entrepreneur what you explain is you just need  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:44):**  A risk premium and the entrepreneur must pay back the debt with this risk premium  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:48):**  For example could be 20 percent for three years or three years and a half  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:53):**  Which is the maximum maturity we we are doing for our four years program  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:07:59):**  And it just means that the the entrepreneur  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:01):**  Is borrowing 100 at the beginning and for one year there is no  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:07):**  Cash flow so he can really grow his company. We don't need some cash back for the first year  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:12):**  But after one year every six months, he will pay back a percentage of  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:18):**  His gross sales. So it means if the company is is more successful that  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:23):**  What we checked on the business plan instead of three or three point five years  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:27):**  They will be able to redeem after two years and it will be a high return for us  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:32):**  But it's a high return you are doing  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:34):**  Thanks to the company's success not because you were negotiating at the beginning high interest rate  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:40):**  So by by doing this way a lot of entrepreneur understand that perhaps  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:46):**  The price of capital would be higher, but it's always cheaper than equity  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:51):**  But could be higher than just interest rate  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:08:53):**  Just interest rate, but they are happy to share this because it's higher because they are more successful  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:02):**  It's also a way for us to screen companies to see how how they advanced and why not consider an equity investment in the future  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:13):**  So it's also a learning curve for our investors starting with Noritare their comfort zone  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/03/24/aymeric-jung-josep-segarra/#t=0:09:19):**  comfortable program and now ready to go to more private equity deals because they are confident in in

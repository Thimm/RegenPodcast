**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:14):**  How do we sell the full rotation from an arable farm or all the products coming from an advanced  agroforestry system?  Diversified farms are amazing, but how do we sell all of that if you're not going to  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:24):**  a small local farmers market?  What is the role of technology and platforms and predictive software?  Learn more about a company doing just that and selling to more than 10,000 customers  
**[0:00:34-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:34):**  in Switzerland.  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:43):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:57-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:57):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:05):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:19):**  our work.  And so many of you have joined as a member.  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:26):**  guests, ask me anything sessions, plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:39):**  Thank you.  So welcome to another episode today with the co-founder of Crowd Container.  Welcome Tobias.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:46):**  Hi Koen.  Thank you so much for having me.  Great to be here.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:49):**  To start with the personal question I always love to ask, how did you end up working on  soil?  Because if I'm not mistaken, you weren't born on a farm.  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:58):**  Yeah, that's right.  I was born in a small farmer village at the time.  It was still pretty much a farmer village.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:04):**  Now it's changing.  I've always been interested in food, but I really started thinking more about soil when  I like at the beginning of the last decade, when I was working in wholesale trade, selling  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:19):**  a lot of certified product or organic certified, fair trade certified, all kinds of certification.  And I realized that people who are really working with the soil, who are on their farms,  having very diversified production system that care for the soil, they have a huge structural  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:38):**  disadvantage in selling their produce.  And when I realized that, I thought that's really something, something is going wrong  there and I started also thinking what can be done about it.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:51):**  What is that structural disadvantage?  I mean, I can come up with a few, like you're probably producing different kinds of products  and the quantities are smaller or you put in a lot of effort and maybe extra costs.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:03):**  What is the main structural disadvantage that puts you against the system as we now know  it, the anonymized commodity system we've built over the last year?  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:13):**  So basically what happens is that you have this retail system with big supermarket retailers,  where we, most of us buy our food.  And what you find on the supermarket shelf, as you said, is anonymized commodities, basically  
**[0:03:29-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:29):**  food that has a certain shape, a very clearly predefined shape, and that the supermarket  makes sure that he has never an empty shelf space because he can source that same type  of food from many different places.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:47):**  Now what happens if you diversify your production system and you start growing different varieties,  different kinds of crops, you get, as you said, smaller quantities, but you also get  a different kind of food with different qualities that is often higher quality food, but you  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:05):**  don't fit that small shelf space anymore.  So that's the biggest problem that I experienced in many different ways with many different  products by trying to sell to supermarkets that in the end, it would not exactly match  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:20):**  that specification of the commodity.  So let's say it seems to be that the supermarket or the supermarket shelf is the issue, then  what is the solution or what is a solution that you've of course been working on and  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:34):**  experimenting with because you've done a lot of pilots?  What was the first solution you tried that maybe didn't work or did work?  I don't know what was the first pilot like, but what was the first version or the first  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:44):**  attempt of CrowdContainer?  Well when I was still working in wholesale straight, of course, I did also many trials  and trying to work in very close partnership with supermarkets, trying to find my own shelf  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:57):**  space, nothing really worked out.  And so I thought in the end I have to get direct access to the end consumer because  just looking at myself, I formed this hypothesis that really tasty pepper for instance that  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:05:15):**  doesn't have really the right size to enter the supermarket shelf, that that could be  something that could also be interesting for other end consumers and that they also might  appreciate the whole story of how this pepper is grown, why the variety is different, why  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:05:31):**  it tastes different, why it looks different, that that might be something that is attractive  for the end consumer but not really attractive for a supermarket buying commodities.  And that's where actually the idea of CrowdContainer was born, that's also where the name is coming  
**[0:05:47-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:05:47):**  from, that the first pilot we did was just to put online a box full of spices and cashew  nuts and coconut from some mixed crop agroforestry farms in the south of India in Kerala and  we were proposing this to people via a crowdfunding platform here in Switzerland and just seeing  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:12):**  whether there is a demand for it.  And you picked very deliberately a mixed forest or mixed agroforestry systems or different  products, you weren't selling just the coconut oil or just the coconut or just the spices  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:24):**  and were you already explaining that story like look if you want more trees to be in  agriculture systems, it's called agroforestry and that means they're going to be different  trees together because we don't want a monoculture there which means we need different spices  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:38):**  etc or we're just selling like these are very high-end, very tasty spices and some other  things together like this is a nice box to have or what was the storytelling there when  you did the crowdfunding?  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:49):**  Yeah of course we deliberately picked really that whole, the big variety that you have  on that field, we cannot do everything because some produce is being consumed locally which  is also very nice but everything that can basically be exported non-perishables, we  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:05):**  put it in that box and we really positioned it in a way to say this is what that forest  can give you instead of just cashew nuts.  And how was the response?  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:16):**  How did people respond to cashew plus a lot more?  Yeah we were quite surprised like in the beginning it was a bit like the beginning of the crowdfunding  was according to our expectations, we were on track, everything fine but not really you  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:33):**  know nothing crazy and then there was some sort of a turning point where the media came  in where some people like influencers picked up that story and said oh but that's amazing,  that is really true that is coming from one hectare of land all these different products  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:49):**  so amazing and then the media came in and bigger media came in and we were completely  like overrun by these orders or actually crowdfunding contributions which we had to compensate with  this mixed box full of stuff.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:05):**  How many boxes did you pre-sell basically?  Yeah it was at that time it was something more than 500 but it was big boxes, it was  each box 150 euro.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:20):**  And so you felt there was something, something was there, people didn't only want a box for  a good value but they were also interested in that one hectare or one piece of an agroforestry  system can get all of this like something was clicking there with the media and influencers  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:34):**  etc.  So what was, apart from shipping all these boxes, what was the next step?  Yeah I mean the first thing as you said, shipping the boxes for me was a big thing because I  
**[0:08:43-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:43):**  always I just traded big like standard containers filled with one product and so when it turned  you know from kind of asking people to support your crowdfunding to you know so the demand  is just coming in and the crowdfunding is ending and people are still asking whether  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:09:03):**  they can still get one of these boxes and we had to say no now it's closed and you know  we were like who now we have to bring that stuff to Switzerland and will it pass customs,  will it comply with all the regulations, all that stuff because it's not the standardized  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:09:23):**  food that you usually find and import.  So the first or the next step was really to make sure that everything is in line with  regulation that customs are sorted out and actually it was easier than I expected.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:09:40):**  I thought that now you know probably the big problems start but then I realized again that  a lot of you know the requirements that I had with buyers this 12 page specification  sheet a lot of that was actually you know the I don't know the packaging size or a machine  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:01):**  of the supermarket that needed that specification and not really legal requirements.  So we imported that container, we made a big party when it arrived and had the four or  five hundred people come there and pick up their boxes.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:16):**  Yeah has been quite amazing.  And the boxes were already packed in with the farmer co-op in India or you were packing  it when the container opened in Zurich?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:27):**  No at the time it was packed at origin at source.  Which saved a lot of time probably on your end.  Yeah which otherwise this arrival party wouldn't have been possible.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:37):**  Would have been a packing party.  Yeah I mean today we don't have to do arrival parties anymore and many people ask for it  because it's still in their mind as this crowd container experience and it's for that reason  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:51):**  we can't do it we have to do picking here in Switzerland.  And so then five hundred people and more because maybe many took it together with friends etc.  were super happy and you could go back to your normal day job but you didn't.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:04):**  What was the next step?  Yeah many people challenged me then I said look this can work and people said no come  on Tobias this is only because you have been there in India and you know these guys and  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:15):**  it's your relation to them and it's that's a really special case I don't think that exists  anywhere else and that somehow for me it really motivated me to figure out whether this is  now really a special story with this agroforestry in Kerala and my relation to that or whether  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:34):**  it is something that really yeah whether it's really that structural as I imagined it to  be.  So we did another four crowd fundings with different origins different countries we imported  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:47):**  coffee from agroforestry coffee from Peru we imported some stuff from Italy we started  working with some Swiss farmers and each time that proved true that basically yeah people  are interested in that type of product and that we can also deliver it.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:05):**  And so there was really one off like you were selling a box of coffee plus other things  I'm imagining and turning that from a let's say a crowdfunding machine or a crowdfunding  campaign machine into a company I can imagine is quite a step what was the turning point  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:21):**  there is that after four because you could have gone on not do number five and six and  seven and what was the moment you said okay we need to turn this into something more than  just opening parties for containers and into something more structured.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:33):**  Yeah there were several constraints in that model no one very you know from the customer  side it was clear that once you have one of those boxes with all that stuff inside that  you soon might need more pepper but not more cloth for instance and that you don't want  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:53):**  to order another box but on a crowdfunding page you cannot really implement the real  web shop where you can choose what you want to have and that made that it was hard you  know it was easy to convince new people but it was hard for the really convinced customers  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:10):**  to reorder which of course was something we had to fix also because we always wanted to  work in very close partnerships with the farmers and not kind of jump from one sourcing partner  to the next one because that wouldn't help them in the way they produce.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:28):**  Then also we had a little bit of legal constraints in terms of we started this with an association  and the association made quite a big turnover with its crowdfunding so of course authorities  started also asking some questions what it really is so we...  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:45):**  What are you actually importing?  Yeah what we do as an association here how commercial it is also in terms of you have  to register with food authorities and all that stuff so it became pretty clear that  
**[0:13:58-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:58):**  we have to incorporate by 2017 second half of 2017 it became very clear that we have  to incorporate and for me it was clear at that point that we want to do the two steps  together we want to incorporate and then build our own platform to run this properly and  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:19):**  also in a way that people can really become regular customers.  And there I wouldn't say you become an online supermarket but you're going in the direction  of unbundling again the bundle you've built for that one piece of forest or one piece  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:34):**  of the farm.  So what was the first products you put on or how did that transition from the campaigning  every couple of months in another box to you can actually order individual things or you  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:45):**  can how did you unbundle that how did people respond because they were used to this campaigning  piece as well I'm imagining.  Yeah so I always had this idea in my mind and it's still somehow there when I developed  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:57):**  this idea of crowd containers when I was still working with wholesale straight that somehow  you know this once you accelerate this campaigning and then accelerated more and more it's somehow  slowly the difference between normal shopping and campaign shopping kind of or pre-ordering  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:15:16):**  will get blurred more and more and it can become more and more convenient for end consumers  to take part in campaigns or sales campaigns without even feeling that it is really a sales  campaign because it starts overlapping and you have a bigger number of people so you  
**[0:15:32-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:15:32):**  have a bigger spread of you know what kind of products are ordered and so we did just  the first step in that direction by first of all as you said unbundling the box and  just offering the same products separately and see what the demand for the individual  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:15:52):**  products was but still of course by putting it online in one shop from one region all  these products giving that context that they grow all together and asking people to buy  a box which is customized for their needs still we sold a lot of each product.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:16:12):**  And so what is now we're in 2021 what has crowd container morphed into what is it currently  if I would go to the website I definitely put the link below it is in German so you  will need Google translate if you don't speak German but you get you will get a good idea  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:16:27):**  what is it currently offering and then we'll get to talk about the future obviously.  So currently you find offerings from five different origins one is Switzerland we work  with around 20 farms here in Switzerland then Sicily where we work with two pharma cooperatives  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:16:46):**  there is this product from India we were talking about there is still the coffee from Peru  and there is a newly also some products from Spain and you would have regular crowd ordering  so it's still based on this idea that we collect orders it's pre-sold basically and we import  
**[0:17:07-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:17:07):**  and send you whatever has been ordered what you find on the website for each product is  a very big amount of transparency information including cost transparency because you pre-order  it you get really that right to a full transparency because no one is speculating with that food  
**[0:17:26-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:17:26):**  in between the producers and us so you get the price plate who gets what for each product.  And then it arrives on my doorstep or there's still some kind of party when I can go and  pick it up or both because it's mostly Zurich it's a number of cities in Switzerland let's  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:17:42):**  just be very clear and how does it work to end up being on my plate.  So we operate in the whole of Switzerland you can order food from anywhere the non-perishable  products are delivered in a box from the Swiss Postal Service they have a very nice yellow  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:01):**  box which they take back which is circular system and we choose that because it's the  most sustainable delivery option at the moment and you can do this from anywhere in Switzerland  the fresh products they have currently a separate logistics and you have to pick it up we partner  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:19):**  with another shop and they have shops in each like bigger cities there are no real big cities  here in Switzerland but in each bigger city you have a pickup point where you can pick  up for instance fresh mangoes from Spain.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:33):**  Wow yeah so it's a mix of fruit that mangoes and of course the coffee and I'm imagining  all the tomato like products and the nuts etc from Sicily the whole cashew nut and all  the spices from India so you get pretty far I mean not all your daily stuff but quite  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:49):**  a nice variety of things you would anyway buy in the supermarket without any price transparency  and obviously completely different quality and in terms of prices both for the customers  for the end consumers and for the farmers what are the big differences there compared  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:04):**  to buying in the supermarket like am I spending twice as much or compared to organic where  am I more or less depends obviously on the product in terms of pricing and then what  does it mean for the farmers to sell with you?  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:16):**  Yeah on the farmer side we have tried to calculate it to compare it to commodity prices which  is of course you know comparing Apple and Pears but still we did it and on an average  we pay 2.7 times the commodity price to farmers.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:32):**  For the consumer this means it can vary quite a lot depending on the product it's very hard  to compare to what you get in the supermarket but if you get similar products at some small  shops that is possible no or also on a farmers market you can find sometimes similar products  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:54):**  in the small shop they cost you more than if you buy it from us.  So if you go for the higher end fair trade specialist small shops in the larger cities  you would pay more.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:05):**  Or like gourmet shop whatever yeah.  And in this case it even gets even on your doorstep which helps obviously.  So that's currently you have how many customers or regular customers do you have interacting  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:17):**  with the platform of course some order large quantities some order maybe less but as it  is a crowd place I mean it gets bundled but just to give a sense of scale how many people  are interacting on the Swiss side of things as a customer.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:29):**  Yeah currently we are at almost 10,000 paying customers.  Which is a lot.  And of course there is a lot of variation in that group like you know you have maybe  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:43):**  20% of them really regular customers ordering every month or even several times per month  and then you have people who are one offs and you have also a lot of people because  fortunately I can tell that we are growing quite fast at the moment so that also gives  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:02):**  you a lot of people who have just managed to buy the first time and we don't know yet  how whether they will develop into a regular customer or whether they will.  They are a recent cohort yeah.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:14):**  And what does because you have a very specific I mean we've known each other for a bit very  specific view on what the role of crowd container will be or could be in the future for regenerative  agriculture can you let us have a look into the future whether you want crowd container  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:31):**  evolve into or what would you like it to be in let's say a couple of years could be much  longer but not next month but in an ideal world what would quite container do for both  the customers and obviously for the farm and the farmers to co-produce etc.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:46):**  Yeah I mean from what I experienced we are really still committed and have that vision  of creating a distribution model that is tailored to the needs of really diversified regenerative  agriculture which I think is very much needed to make regenerative agriculture a business  
**[0:22:07-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:07):**  model for the farmers as well a real business case and to bring in young people into farming  make it interesting for them and then also to attract investment I think there is still  a lot to be done also in terms of technology adapt technology for the farms in a way that  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:27):**  it can really be used in this kind of mixed crop set up there's still a long way to go  and I think in our view really that distribution piece has to be put in place to make that  transition work because of course now there is a lot of things going on on the farms but  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:46):**  I hear again and again that many times even though you know you can increase your yields  you can increase the quality you grow but that doesn't always mean that you can easily  sell your stuff.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:58):**  Yeah I think it's a point we need to talk more on this podcast and hopefully we will  over the next months and years like how do we actually sell it makes things coming from  forestry systems agroforestry systems but also arable it's not going to be pretty sure  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:23:14):**  it's not going to be monocultures which means we need ways to sell cover crops that might  be super an amazing ingredient in something and we need that layer on top of the farm  or beyond the farm gate that is able to sell to distribute to reach the end consumer with  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:23:29):**  the right Facebook ad to use the right storytelling to which is not the job of the farmer some  are amazing at it but it's I mean they have a lot to figure out on the farm and we need  the disruptors I wouldn't say in the supermarket but figure out a way to get these these very  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:23:46):**  diverse which is very difficult I mean logistic wise mixing mangoes and coffee is as you know  much better than I do very complex so do you really see that digital layer that layer of  connecting there the city obviously as with the countryside and explaining the diversity  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:24:01):**  is that enough or does it really need to go to a next level with the pickup points and  the shipping and make it as convenient as possible what you're feeling there how far  do we need to go to make it as convenient as walking into a supermarket at 530 or 630  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:24:16):**  and take something from the shelf yeah I think we have to work on both ends on one side you  have really the operational side where we have also learned in the last three or five  years of prototyping that you know a certain kind of convenience will be required and we  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:24:36):**  think we know how to work on it we already started to work now with the demand forecasting  and we will slowly slowly replace this crowd ordering model by more forecast model which  is of course feasible only if you have quite a large number of customers but we are closely  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:24:55):**  getting to a what do you mean by a forecasting model what would that mean in practice that  would mean in practice for instance right now where we have already started is that  we have a shipment from Sicily every month and until last year we always waited for the  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:25:12):**  order to be sent for the like we did the sales campaign finish the sales campaign sent the  order and now we can already send the order we can already anticipate what will be sold  like at the beginning of the campaign in the future even more in the future we will be  
**[0:25:30-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:25:30):**  able to send the order before the stuff is sold and still be reasonably sure that 98%  is actually really will be sold like this and then comes this combination of mango and  coffee no because at that point we will be able to have some olive oil with us that we  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:25:50):**  know that we are going to sell it in the next month and we can ship it together with the  fresh mango when the mango is ripe so that's a piece of convenience that we will slowly  add like we did the unbundling of the boxes and we can do it by building up that really  
**[0:26:07-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:07):**  large number of end customers who are regularly ordering from us and you take on then of course  a bit of the risk of storing potentially quite a few mangoes or quite a few olive oil bottles  that you might not sell you know you will probably so that gets I mean that will be  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:25):**  interesting but of course that also means it's much faster so I still taking part of  a crowd campaign but if I order and it closes like it might already be in Switzerland so  it can be delivered much faster than now when I maybe have to wait until it closes and then  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:39):**  it gets shipped and then I mean if it spices from India it can take a while obviously so  also the speed there comes bigger but a bit of you take a bit of risk but should be compensated  by the amount of people you have ordering in general.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:51):**  Of course you could still argue now that we are becoming like the supermarket so I think  I just to show you a bit more like how that vision could look like so every week you get  this availability the available products from our partners you can decide what you want  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:27:09):**  to do what kind of a weekly order and the order will be based on the perishable product  on the fresh product which has to come directly from the farm because everything else doesn't  make sense but based on all the data we have we know that you know so many people will  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:27:27):**  order some olive oil together with the mango which of course also makes it makes it worth  delivering it to your home and that will be feasible because we compared to the supermarket  we will really base all that supply chain management on the data that we have from our  
**[0:27:46-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:27:46):**  end customers and we will pass it through the whole the supply chain till the producer  know so even the producer gets access to that data and can plan accordingly.  What happens at the supermarket of course the supermarket also collects all that data  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:02):**  and they have many more customers and much more accurate data projections but it stops  at the marketing they will use it to do a better marketing for their customers but then  behind you have this sort of like pyramid system of traders one middleman who is handing  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:19):**  the product on to the others and they make sure that whatever the supermarket needs is  available and that's where it becomes not feasible or unsustainable for a diversified  farm.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:32):**  So we will create a model which is based on data but where the data is passed on through  the supply chain up to the producer.  And would you see then you starting a conversation with the producer as well to diversify the  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:50):**  farm or to maybe introduce crops that you know you can sell or products that you know  you see a demand from.  How far do you see that conversation going is it going to be a one-way street just feeding  
**[0:29:01-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:01):**  information look next year we'll need X bottles or X jars or X mangoes or actually if you  would introduce YZ with your rotation or in your first year system we actually have a  market for it because we know this.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:15):**  How close do you see those things will be a one-way street or actually a conversation?  It already happens from both sides so for instance our partners in Sicily they tell  us yeah it would be better for our crop rotation system if we include topi nambur or something  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:33):**  like this.  Do you think you have a market for this?  So we try to see if we have sold a similar product and we try to of course make a forecast.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:43):**  I don't think there's a similar product with the topi nambur.  It's quite an artichoke just for that.  Artichokes yeah maybe.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:49):**  It's quite a specific.  No we they make a paste out of it that's a real case so they make a paste out of the  fit so we have compared it to certain pestos and certain kind of sources that we offer  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:02):**  and we told them yeah okay probably there will be a demand probably we can sell so and  so much of this so they did a test and then we sold it and it worked out well so now they  have been able to include that into their crop rotation.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:17):**  That is happening all the time which a supermarket would never ever even imagine it's not even  in their vocabulary to suggest something like that.  That's fascinating.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:25):**  Yeah there is the other way around it's like you figure out that topi nambur is a very  hip thing to eat at the moment so you will look for a trader who can offer topi nambur  in the right quality and then you look for another tool to make sure that you get always  
**[0:30:39-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:39):**  supply and where it ends up in terms of production you have no clue and of course at the moment  this is still on a very you know we talk a lot together and try to figure out what will  work and I'm sure that in the future this will be much more data based because we see  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:57):**  it with products for instance tomato sauce, basata is turning really fast and there we  only talk about numbers you know there you already see that you have the data you have  the certainty how much you can sell and farmers are asking what would you forecast based on  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:14):**  the past sales numbers.  Which is an amazing discussion to have because they can plan for next year and potentially  next years and of course their rotation might change where to put the tomatoes and the topi  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:25):**  nambur etc.  Exactly so our vision is really you know in the end we will have a system where the farmer  can access some sort of back end and put in yeah if I would grow barley next year how  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:37):**  much could I sell through the crowd container channel and the system will give him you know  a number with a certain level of uncertainty and will say okay 90% sure you can sell that  many tons of barley.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:51):**  For this and this price and then you can decide if it's worth the risk to engage in that.  Yeah or rather the other way around in terms of pricing the farmer puts the price that  he needs to grow it in a way which is sustainable for him and then based on that our engine  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:09):**  will tell him how much he can sell with that price.  That makes more sense how long do you envision before a system like that I mean that complex  but is it years from now is it something you're already building is it 10 plus years or do  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:23):**  you feel from what you've seen going from the individual pilots to much more structured  and fluid system at the moment but this of course what you pictured now is a few steps  further what do you envision there is it something we can talk about 12 months from now is it  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:38):**  a few years.  We want to fully replace this crowd ordering model by a prognostic model in the next three  years then it will not be based on you know crazy artificial intelligence with a lot of  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:53):**  metadata hopefully that will come further down the road but within the next three years  with statistical models maybe with some bringing in some first easy to handle metadata like  calendar and stuff like this we are already testing that we will be able to replace it  
**[0:33:11-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:11):**  with a prognostic model and hopefully then refine the prognostic model step by step until  we can do a yearly planning with the farmers based on that prognostic model which will  probably take yeah another two three years.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:29):**  Super interesting.  So but it's not I mean the technology is there we are testing it with some individual pilot  it works both for farmers and for consumers and for us also I mean this pre ordering or  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:41):**  you know that the earlier ordering of the stuff from Italy hasn't really increased our  risk a lot we know what we are going to sell so we feel pretty sure that this can become  reality.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:54):**  And switching gears a bit and a few questions I always like to ask on the investing side  of things you are fundraising you have been talking to a lot of impact investors in Europe  probably I would say all of them but many what have you seen like is there compared  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:08):**  to three four years ago or four years ago actually when you started or five even is  there more interest and what do you feel like is missing are investors actually getting  interested in that layer on of the farm or is it still a lot of discussion on ag tech  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:24):**  and land buying and regenerating in the region ag and food space what do you see when you  talk to investors that are reaching out to you you reach out to them obviously discussing  the food system.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:35):**  As you said we are currently fundraising and we are close to closing the actual round  and this would not have happened I think 10 years ago because when I was still working  in that other company in the trading company discussions were far away from that we were  
**[0:34:53-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:53):**  already also engaged with the impact investment funds and I think it has changed quite a bit  the understanding of the systemic importance of the food system and to understand it and  also to really see it as an investment opportunity that kind of understanding has not been there  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:35:17):**  at that time it was purely like is it really fair trade what you are doing or is it organic  I am more from this fair trade space so I invest in that how much premium do the farmers  get but a more systemic view is definitely something that is coming up that we are feeling.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:35:34):**  And what would you do if you would be in charge of a large investment fund let's say I don't  know how much it exactly is I think it's quite close to the euro one billion Swiss franc  you'll be an investor tomorrow you have a very long view if you want to or a very short  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:35:47):**  one could also be the case apart from obviously closing the fundraising round of crowd container  but what would you focus the rest of an investment fund that size on if you had free range of  choosing in the food and egg space how would you put that to work?  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:36:01):**  I think in the beginning as a first step it would be very important still to invest in  consumer awareness to really find smart projects that are investable form the sort of awareness  on both ecological and health aspects of food on the other hand on the production side I  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:36:22):**  already mentioned that I think there is a lot to be done to create lighter and smarter  equipment that really helps diversified farms and cheaper ones and cheaper ones of course  also and you need a certain scale to build you know cheaper and smart and light equipment.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:36:43):**  It's not the sexiest part of the sector but equipment is something I keep hearing as well  like we need to reinvent everything around a tractor you possibly imagine everything  around all the harvesting equipment the processing equipment simply weeding equipment I mean  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:36:56):**  there's such an amount of innovation needed there that it's a huge not a very sexy but  a huge opportunity.  Yeah but I think first the farmer needs to be sure that there is a demand for this type  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:09):**  of products otherwise it doesn't make sense to invest in it.  So on the consumer sorry on the consumer awareness side what would you focus on you said health  and ecology what would be the main if you had this definitely stolen from Tim Ferriss  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:23):**  but the huge billboard in San Francisco where I don't know how many people or a gigantic  billboard somewhere where I don't know a billion people pass pass by what would you put on  it like what would be your focus point on ecology and health to get many more consumers  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:38):**  interested in like looking at food differently not just at feed but actually at food.  That growing really matters I think is a lot of misperceptions around you know that packaging  or transportation are the most important parts and you can consult any life cycle assessment  
**[0:37:58-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:58):**  of food and you see that growing that food is really the like paramount part of the footprint  of a product and that's both in ecological terms it goes far beyond co2 it but also on  the social side so many people involved into growing a product and like packaging bit or  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:38:20):**  the transportation are just very small parts of it so I think that's something that people  have to understand that you know how you grow it it will fundamentally impact the ecosystems  and the people but it will also fundamentally impact you as a person like what are you really  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:38:40):**  eating there it really makes a huge difference.  And it's such a complex story how would you get that to the masses how would you I mean  maybe you don't have an answer to that but how would you spend that billion or invest  
**[0:38:55-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:38:55):**  a billion or a similar size amount to get the masses to understand also if you are living  below the poverty line if you are rushing through a supermarket to get something quick  on the table for your children and you're juggling two or three jobs like how do you  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:39:10):**  get people to see the importance of food and the growing part of it.  I think there are two sides to that I mean one thing is we are currently prototyping  how to make you know how to create that sort of awareness or understanding and we work  
**[0:39:27-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:39:27):**  a lot with storytelling but we also work a lot with communities so we kind of use communities  or try to involve communities to really spread that message and that's much more efficient  than just doing online ads.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:39:43):**  On the other hand it's a very important thing that you mentioned that you know people below  poverty line or people who have just so many things in their daily life that they will  just not be able to focus on it and I'm quite sure there is also some policy part to it.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:00):**  So I think when you think about really the fundamental transition that the food system  has to go through there has to be this like businesses and market actors but there's also  a policy part and for me if I had this like magic wand to change something now.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:18):**  You're stealing my next question but go ahead.  Then I would really introduce a policy that makes sure that true cost accounting is applied  across the whole value chains and that at the end when you buy a product you really  
**[0:40:37-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:37):**  pay a price that somehow has internalized all these externalities and that is not only  negative externalities but also positives ones like health.  By eating healthy food you get prevented from getting ill and thereby for instance the state  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:55):**  can save some health costs.  So it's very important that both sides are calculated or factored into that true cost  and that will also make healthy food much more affordable.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:08):**  Eating against disease.  I think the policy piece we haven't focused a lot on in the podcast we should do it more  I just find it very difficult to grasp what's the role of investors and food companies but  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:21):**  I think lobbying there is just as important as the fossil fuel industry and honestly the  extractive food and agriculture industry is very good at and we need to just as we need  to learn how to use the tool finance and money in this sector we also need to learn how to  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:37):**  use the tool lobbying because that's potentially the biggest lever we have.  Like the moment you change certain policies and many farmers are doing many things that  aren't even allowed in their region like they're mixing cropping systems, they're integrating  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:51):**  animals with olive trees which in many places is not even allowed for good reasons because  we created an industrial ag system where that was very dangerous but these are the pioneers  that are doing everything that isn't officially legal but creating the most amazing food and  
**[0:42:05-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:05):**  having all these positive externalities so something has to change there but yeah we  have the time to lobby and who has the resources to lobby in Brussels, in Washington, in New  Delhi, in anywhere where power resides to change those policies that's going to be a  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:19):**  big question I think in the years to come especially in Europe as the next gap is coming  up in four or five years and of course the farm bill in the US has an enormous impact  as well where levers are changed and that's something we cover very often on the podcast.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:34):**  Absolutely but I think the role of business is really to show that it is possible, that  it is feasible, that there is also a demand, that there are consumers who understand it  and who want it and you can criticize a lot what is happening in the organic space but  
**[0:42:50-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:50):**  this is they definitely had a big impact also on policies by just showing that it is technically  possible to grow a crop without using chemical fertilizers and that has triggered a lot of  policies also and I think that's a role model also for what we are doing by just showing  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:43:12):**  what is possible, showing that it is also an attractive choice and then the lobbying  can really kick in and change things. If there is nothing there or nothing visible you will  not be able to lobby and that's also why this lobbying for a thing that is already there  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:43:27):**  is always much easier to defend the status quo.  And you have potentially in this case 10,000 but in a few years 100,000 people that you  can mobilize and push and sign and potentially get on the street etc. because you need large  
**[0:43:43-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:43:43):**  movements to change policies and to push policies as well. So it's something I hope to do more  interviews on that even though it's not the core part of this podcast.  But I'm looking forward to it. I'm also very interested in that question. I mean often  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:00):**  it is also played one thing against the other. Should business solve it or should politics  solve it and I don't see it like this. My theory of change is really that business shows  what is feasible, that the pioneers really make things possible and then we need some  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:20):**  policies which make it also accessible for all groups of the population.  Yeah, we've seen that with renewable energy which is by no means perfect but has done  – really came out of a few pioneers that spent way too much money for the solar panels  
**[0:44:34-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:34):**  at the beginning and brought down the cost curve and obviously with all the issues on  production side but really showed that it's an alternative. Then policies followed partly  first in Germany that really kickstarted a lot and then many followed and now it's an  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:48):**  industry that moves ahead. Still it's going too slow. We need more smart goods, better  storage solutions, better recycling and all of that. But it's an unstoppable force. It  keeps going because it was started by a few pioneers that paid and some policies and then  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:03):**  a lot of very, very, very hard work. And I feel like we're at the beginning of that.  I hope we go faster than that one. But to end with a final question, what do you believe  to be true about agriculture, about regenerative agriculture that others don't? Like where  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:16):**  are you contrarian? Which is definitely a question inspired by John Kempf. He usually  asks a similar question on this podcast.  I think it relates to what we have been talking about the policy also. I see in regenerative  
**[0:45:31-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:31):**  agriculture really a force that can unite and be very inclusive. I feel it can somehow  help to bridge the gaps between conventional farming and organic farming, between movements  like the biodynamic movement and the agroecological movement. I think the worst thing we could  
**[0:45:51-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:51):**  do would be to become another small group, small movement that says that we have the  only truth. But I really see that it is very deeply rooted in the regenerative movement,  that there is this openness and inclusiveness and that respect also for the individuality  
**[0:46:09-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:46:09):**  of each production system of each farm. And I hope that we can extend this also and really  with that, yeah, really unite these forces to make a transition of the food system possible.  And with that, I want to thank you so much for showing up in a very, very busy time and  
**[0:46:30-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:46:30):**  not only logistically, but fundraising as well and many other things and sharing your  story until now and the Story of Cod container.

**[0:47:27-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:47:27):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it. Why are we doing this  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:47:40):**  course? After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how  to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  and recording this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:47:55):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years? How have we built our decision making  framework? What to focus on with the podcast? How have we picked interviewees? What questions  should you ask? What is happening in the space? What should you read? What should you listen?  
**[0:48:10-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:10):**  What should you watch? How to approach this space? For whom is this course? You, the soil  builders and investors in this space. The soil builders, people working in this space,  entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders,  
**[0:48:25-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:25):**  ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic  management consultants, etc. People that are building soil at scale. And the investors  who are putting their own money to work through their family office or as private individuals  
**[0:48:39-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:39):**  or people who are putting other people's money to work through foundations, institutional  capital, banks, insurance companies, etc. Is this course free? No. This is pay what  you think it's worth. Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth  
**[0:48:55-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:55):**  to you and I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with  very different means. So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and  if you have the means to consider paying what you think it's worth. Thank you.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:10):**  So what is this course? It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15  minutes plus PDF slides so you don't have to ride along. We're going to look into why  invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture is so risky, how to  
**[0:49:26-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:26):**  invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest in,  what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if you're  a soil builder. Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of  
**[0:49:41-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:41):**  reports, what kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to  dig deeper. We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not? It's not a list of investable deals. Unfortunately that doesn't exist in  
**[0:49:55-0:49:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:55):**  this world. We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice. Before making any investment please find professional investment  advice. So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking,

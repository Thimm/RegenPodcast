**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:00:13):**  You're going to listen to an interview with Jesse Solomon, founder and CEO of Emerinco,  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:00:18):**  working to change the chicken business from the ground up.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:00:21):**  We're going to talk about transparency and their first VR chicken experience.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:00:25):**  We're going to talk about regenerative agriculture and what the role of chicken and livestock is.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:00:30):**  But also about their challenges, their challenges with investors and their relatively short timeframe.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:00:35):**  But everything in agriculture takes time, especially building soil.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:00:38):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:00:39):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:00:45):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:00:47):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:00:51):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:00:56):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:01:01):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:01:03):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:01:07):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:01:10):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:01:15):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:01:19):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:01:23):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:01:27):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:01:30):**  Share more interviews, there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative  
**[0:01:34-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:01:34):**  food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:01:35):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:01:40):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:01:57):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:00):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:01):**  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the Planet Mattered.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:05):**  I'm Koen van Zeyen, your host.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:07):**  In the podcast of today I'm joined by Jesse Solomon, founder and CEO of EmerandCo, a former  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:12):**  investment manager who since 2015 sells heritage chickens from regenerative farms.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:17):**  I'm going to ask all about it.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:19):**  Welcome Jesse!  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:20):**  Thanks so much Koen for having me.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:22):**  Excited to talk.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:23):**  I always love to start with a personal question and I think in this case it makes a lot of  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:28):**  sense as well.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:29):**  How do you end up in regenerative agriculture to begin with but heritage chickens as a niche  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:35):**  within the niche of the niche?  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:38):**  So about ten or actually more than that now, years ago I read a book called Eating Animals  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:43):**  by Jonathan Safran Foer and after I finished that book I instantly became a vegetarian.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:49):**  I decided that I couldn't eat the meat that I was eating anymore unless I knew exactly  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:56):**  where it came from and I had a personal connection to it.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:02:58):**  So I started to hunt and for me that was the only way that I could trust that what I was  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:03:03):**  eating was pure, that the animal was respected, and that it was the healthiest and purest  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:03:08):**  form of food that I could eat and that it tasted just amazing.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:03:12):**  So through hunting I discovered a love and connection to food that I'd never had before  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:03:17):**  and it wasn't just about my own personal journey but it was about bringing that meat back  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:03:21):**  for family and friends and cooking these amazing wild game dinners and seeing how much more  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:03:26):**  they appreciated their food when I could connect them in that extremely personal, intimate  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:03:31):**  way.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:03:32):**  And that was really the genesis of Emmer & Co.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:03:33):**  It started off as a question.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:03:35):**  Is there an opportunity out there where I can create a food company that can replicate  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:03:43):**  that as close to wild experience for as many people as possible and what did that mean?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:03:49):**  And when I stripped away kind of the layers of where I wanted to focus, the two things  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:03:55):**  that were the most important were going back to animals that grew the way they were supposed  
**[0:04:00-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:04:00):**  to so they weren't manipulated for fast growth or any kind of non-welfare optimization and  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:04:09):**  raising those animals holistically with the environment so that you could actually improve  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:04:14):**  the land.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:04:15):**  And these days you hear the phrase a lot of being carbon neutral but it felt like we really  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:04:21):**  had an opportunity to actually improve the soil health, sequester more carbon, grow taller  
**[0:04:26-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:04:26):**  grasses, actually have a net positive impact on land just by growing animals the way they  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:04:33):**  used to be grown.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:04:34):**  And do you still remember, because this is quite a big moment I can imagine when you  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:04:41):**  first saw that agriculture or meat eating actually could have a positive effect on the  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:04:47):**  land, do you still remember when you came across that and what that did to you?  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:04:52):**  Yeah, absolutely, so I kind of had an intuitive sense for a long time.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:04:58):**  I spent a lot of time in Africa and other emerging markets where there wasn't a whole  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:05:06):**  lot of industrialized, mechanized agriculture and so historically if farmers wanted to continue  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:05:13):**  to farm in land that they lived in, you had to farm holistically.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:05:17):**  There wasn't this phrase regenerative agriculture, it used to just be called farming because  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:05:23):**  if you didn't regenerate the soil health and let land rest and have these holistic practices  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:05:29):**  you would ruin the land and you wouldn't be able to grow any food for your family.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:05:33):**  So I was always exposed to that way of doing things but when we started Emerinco and we  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:05:40):**  started with building our first regional production hub on the West Coast, I needed to find a  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:05:46):**  farmer who could partner with me who appreciated this way of raising animals.  
**[0:05:51-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:05:51):**  The first time I was introduced to our current farmer who is our partner in production, Tyler  
**[0:06:00-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:06:00):**  up in Red Bluff, and I went out to meet him and when we toured his property he basically  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:06:08):**  spent the first hour not even talking about chicken, we spent the first hour running around  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:06:15):**  his ranch where he kept pointing out various perennial grasses like the purple needle grass  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:06:22):**  and others and we were talking about clovers as indicators of nitrogen fixing and it was  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:06:29):**  like a crash course in soil health and again we barely said even the word chicken and I  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:06:36):**  knew that this was the guy that I wanted to work with.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:06:41):**  Furthermore the way that it really hit home was when you could see the results of this.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:06:47):**  He had been farming holistically for the last 10 years and the soil on his property was  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:06:55):**  extremely fertile and even in a drought year, this was before a lot of the major rains came  
**[0:07:01-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:07:01):**  in California over the last winter, but the soil was healthy, there was kind of this meadow  
**[0:07:08-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:07:08):**  of grasses, the seeds were really soft which is another indicator of health and yeah you  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:07:16):**  could just see the results.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:07:18):**  Yeah that sounds extremely interesting and also at the same time a story that I've heard  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:07:26):**  many times where it starts with soil and then in this case the chickens etc are almost a  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:07:32):**  tool to build that and of course you need to find a business model and to work with  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:07:37):**  those tools and so you started to then you focus on chickens and how did you build up,  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:07:43):**  how does Emerincode work at the moment?  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:07:46):**  If I want to get chickens where can I get them?  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:07:48):**  How does it end up in my oven?  
**[0:07:51-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:07:51):**  Yeah so we're a wholesale business where we sell mostly to distributors and other partners  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:07:58):**  who can then get our product, our chickens to various consumers whether it's direct at  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:08:05):**  your house or if you're dining in a restaurant.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:08:08):**  So right now we sell to distributors who then sell to retail channels, we also sell to distributors  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:08:15):**  who sell to restaurants and other food service operators and then we work with great online  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:08:20):**  partners who distribute direct to the consumer, people like Good Eggs in San Francisco, Amazon  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:08:27):**  Fresh nationally, other partners like Wild Idea Buffalo and yeah these are, you know  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:08:34):**  this is right now for the fresh products we're limited through logistics to the West Coast  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:08:40):**  but eventually we'd like to expand our production model on the East Coast and further afield  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:08:46):**  and make sure that our slow growth pasture raised chickens are as widely available for  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:08:50):**  consumers as possible.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:08:51):**  And when it came to, I mean we're getting into the juicy details, when it came to choosing  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:08:56):**  the chicken where did you go because you come from an investment background and knew a lot  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:09:02):**  about hunting and cooking, where do you go to find these chickens and that fit so well  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:09:08):**  on these lands and it actually are the closest thing as you said you can basically get to  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:09:12):**  wild?  
**[0:09:14-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:09:14):**  Yeah so you kind of start at the beginning, you go back, you do a lot of research, you  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:09:21):**  first have to understand how the chicken industry evolved and how we ended up at the current,  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:09:28):**  you know with the current system which predominantly raises a Cornish cross breed which is the  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:09:34):**  type of chicken that's kind of the modern conventional chicken and that chicken for  
**[0:09:38-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:09:38):**  some context grows to market weight in about 42 days, sometimes a little less and that  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:09:45):**  has nothing to do with hormones or anything like that, it's truly through breeding over  
**[0:09:52-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:09:52):**  decades that they've been able to identify various genetic markers that allow these birds  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:10:00):**  to put on meat very fast.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:10:02):**  And what that means is when you have a bird that grows that quickly its muscles outgrow  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:10:07):**  its skeletal system, it has severe welfare issues and health issues, its heart is the  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:10:13):**  same size as it was 100 years ago and yet now has twice the muscle mass that it has  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:10:18):**  to pump blood through.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:10:20):**  So you have heart problems, you have lung problems, you have leg problems and so when  
**[0:10:24-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:10:24):**  you understand the context of this industry it becomes easier to identify where we kind  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:10:31):**  of went off on the wrong track.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:10:34):**  And so we were able to find older breeds of chicken, we call them slow growth breeds,  
**[0:10:40-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:10:40):**  that were still developed with meat so that you could have good yield on the carcass,  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:10:48):**  they wouldn't really be like those yard birds that a lot of people are used to in  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:10:53):**  various countries but these were bred for production but still have the slow growth  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:11:00):**  so that their body and anatomy grows in sync with itself and develops a healthy immune  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:11:04):**  system so you never need antibiotics.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:11:07):**  And because their muscle and skeletal systems grow together it means they're really active  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:11:15):**  and they can run around and they can do all the things that chickens do which are important  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:11:19):**  for soil based regenerative production model where you want the chickens running around,  
**[0:11:24-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:11:24):**  you want them scratching up the soil, you need them to be warriors in the system and  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:11:31):**  agents of that kind of healthy change.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:11:33):**  And when you look at those farms they fit in a larger system, they fit in a holistic  
**[0:11:39-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:11:39):**  management system.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:11:40):**  Can you briefly describe for anyone who's listening and hasn't seen that or hasn't  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:11:44):**  heard about that how they fit in there and what their role is?  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:11:48):**  Yeah of course, so it depends on the region so obviously the environment in every part  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:11:55):**  of the world is not the same so what this looks like in South Dakota is very different  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:12:01):**  from what it looks like in California and even in California what it looks like where  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:12:05):**  we raise birds in Northern California is going to be different than what it looks like closer  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:12:10):**  to the coast.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:12:11):**  So just keep in mind that it's a general term to describe farming in sync with the environment  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:12:19):**  and never over impacting anyone part of the ecosystem.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:12:23):**  So for us it primarily means raising multiple species of animals in the same area of land  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:12:30):**  and rotating those pastures with cover crops and rest so that you can always ensure that  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:12:35):**  you're putting the right amount of nutrients into the soil and creating a healthy microbial  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:12:42):**  environment so that you can grow deeper root structures and encourage perennial growth  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:12:47):**  and grow taller grasses.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:12:49):**  So for us we have cattle on the property and those are the first, obviously this is a cycle,  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:12:54):**  but if you imagine the cattle are in one pasture and they're trimming the grasses and depositing  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:13:01):**  their manure and then once the cattle move off of that pasture then you come in with  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:13:05):**  the chickens and the chickens will forage and scratch up the cattle manure, help break  
**[0:13:09-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:13:09):**  that up and spread it around.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:13:12):**  Their manure is much richer and has a different NPK composition and it's extremely fertile  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:13:19):**  and then once the chickens leave those pastures you come back in with no-till cover crops  
**[0:13:22-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:13:22):**  which are a varying mix of different legumes and other annuals that again help with deeper  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:13:30):**  root structure and create that complex soil aggregate.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:13:35):**  And after the no-till cover crop comes in then you're going to let those pastures rest  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:13:39):**  for at least six months or more.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:13:42):**  And then again you start the whole process again.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:13:45):**  And so when you have this kind of symbiotic relationship between chickens and ruminants  
**[0:13:50-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:13:50):**  like cattle or sheep and then cover crops and rest you get a really healthy engine that  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:13:57):**  kind of starts working on its own.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:13:59):**  And when you look at the farms and the farmers you work with, what's the difference for  
**[0:14:04-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:14:04):**  them working with you and selling those heritage chickens through you instead of maybe doing  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:14:12):**  it themselves or what's the difference it means for their daily lives?  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:14:16):**  Yeah, so our model is very different.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:14:19):**  As we grow what we're excited about is rethinking all the parts of a meat production model.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:14:25):**  So not only the animals we grow, making sure they're healthy and slow growing, not only  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:14:31):**  the way we produce these animals, so with regenerative practices that improve the soil  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:14:36):**  health and we're constantly thinking about that aspect, but it's also about the workers  
**[0:14:41-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:14:41):**  that we work with and what kind of company are we.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:14:44):**  And so I like to, we always say that the co in our name actually doesn't stand for company.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:14:50):**  I intentionally named it this to stand for community.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:14:54):**  And I like when people say, oh, Emmer and Company, and I get to correct them.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:14:56):**  And I say, no, actually the co, it stands for community.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:14:59):**  And that was important to us because I wanted to make sure that the community of people,  
**[0:15:05-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:15:05):**  whether it's our customers, our employees, the workers we have in the organization, that  
**[0:15:14-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:15:14):**  they're front and center of everything we do.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:15:16):**  So what we get excited about is again, flipping the model around.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:15:20):**  Up to now, most meat production has been built on a contract model where workers are extremely  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:15:25):**  disintermediated from the end product that gets produced.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:15:28):**  And you have, so you have a contract model on one end of a system and on the other end,  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:15:32):**  you would have a co-op model like organic valley.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:15:35):**  And I think there's room in the middle where we can take elements of a co-op where you  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:15:40):**  can have profit sharing pools and upward mobility and shared knowledge and a community of people  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:15:47):**  that you can work with and really not feel like you're isolated.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:15:51):**  And yet actually also have elements of a company where we can employ the workers, we can give  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:15:57):**  them health benefits, we can provide a pathway to being part of a bigger system.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:16:03):**  Because of the way we grow these birds, it's not likely that you're going to find hundreds  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:16:10):**  and hundreds of thousands of people who have the land base to do this kind of work, have  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:16:15):**  the knowledge to do it, have the systems in place to do it.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:16:18):**  So we get excited about creating a different model where we can hire these workers, they  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:16:23):**  can be trained on training farms and then eventually they could even manage farms if  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:16:29):**  they wanted to, they could eventually if they wanted to even transition into the marketing  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:16:34):**  department or other parts of the organization, they would have the opportunity to do that.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:16:39):**  And if you look at the business, I mean, you started in 2015, what do we look, it's now  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:16:47):**  July 2017.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:16:48):**  If we look a year ago, what has changed since then and what was, let's say, the most difficult  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:16:55):**  or maybe the most challenging, what really kept you up at night in the last year and  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:16:59):**  what can you share about that?  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:17:01):**  Yeah, well, pretty much everything keeps me up at night.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:17:06):**  When you're, I mean, this is what we're trying to do, which is rebuild a meat industry from  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:17:13):**  the ground up.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:17:14):**  Literally.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:17:15):**  Yeah, literally from the ground up.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:17:18):**  It's really hard.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:17:20):**  This supply chain of food production, people barely have a glimpse at what this means.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:17:28):**  Our current food system is really, really, really, really good at getting a whole lot  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:17:34):**  of bad food to the most amount of people at the cheapest price.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:17:38):**  And they've built billions of dollars of infrastructure that helps support that cycle of bad food  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:17:45):**  to the most amount of people at the cheapest price.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:17:48):**  And they control all that infrastructure.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:17:51):**  So if you're trying to start a new kind of company that is trying to think differently  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:17:58):**  about that supply chain, it's really challenging to stitch together infrastructure when you're  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:18:03):**  really small because food production is about scale.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:18:06):**  And even for us, we want to get bigger.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:18:09):**  We want to scale the right way.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:18:10):**  We want our regenerative practices to be so widely practiced that they're everywhere in  
**[0:18:17-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:18:17):**  America and hopefully even further afield.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:18:20):**  But it's a challenge.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:18:22):**  And you have to work with a lot of great partners as you go and trust them and kind of stitch  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:18:28):**  that system together until you get to a big enough scale where you can actually integrate  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:18:33):**  some of those pieces of the supply chain.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:18:36):**  So I'd say what's changed since a year ago is the appreciation for what we do.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:18:43):**  Half of what we do is rebuilding the supply chain and the other half of what we do is  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:18:47):**  education and marketing, what it means to be regenerative, what it means to go back  
**[0:18:52-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:18:52):**  to slow growth breeds and help people connect to food that, again, for 60 to 100 years,  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:18:59):**  they haven't had this option.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:19:01):**  And so they're less familiar with what these words mean.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:19:05):**  Panic was really great, did an amazing job at teaching people to look at labels.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:19:11):**  But now we have to teach people to look beyond the label because it's been too easy for large  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:19:16):**  companies to take these labels that people think mean healthy and they may or they may  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:19:23):**  not.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:19:24):**  And so now, again, we have to teach people to go beyond the label to ask questions about  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:19:29):**  breeds, to ask to see videos of where their food's produced.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:19:34):**  We put a virtual reality tour on our website at www.emmerandco.com.experience.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:19:42):**  And as far as I know, it's the first VR chicken experience on the internet.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:19:48):**  And we did it to show people this is our food.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:19:52):**  There's no secrets, there's nothing to hide.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:19:54):**  And we can be 100% transparent.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:19:58):**  And I think consumers these days need to demand that level of transparency.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:02):**  I mean, if producers or companies they're currently buying from can't provide this to  
**[0:20:07-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:07):**  them, they should probably ask why.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:10):**  I think the education part is key there.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:14):**  And at the same time, very challenging if you are operating or living in food deserts  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:20):**  and operating in places where you don't have access to that.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:23):**  Of course, the internet is helping in that.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:25):**  And what have you been working on?  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:28):**  Something concrete on the last, I mean, the VR one is definitely one.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:31):**  But were there other things in the last few months that you're very excited about that  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:35):**  just went live or the things that are rolling out or things that are part of the operation  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:39):**  that really made a difference?  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:42):**  I mean, the VR experience was a great start.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:45):**  For us, it's, again, we're educating a market that's been used to a certain kind of food  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:54):**  system for a very, very long time.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:20:56):**  So our education initiatives will never end.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:00):**  They're a constant thing.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:01):**  And I get excited about it because it's so fun to be able to help connect people to where  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:07):**  their food comes from in this really transparent manner.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:10):**  So the VR experience, we're going to be continually putting out white papers and infographics  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:16):**  and data around what regenerative means in our practices.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:22):**  As we grow throughout this year, we're going to be bringing on more food customers.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:27):**  We're going to be expanding to different markets like Los Angeles.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:30):**  And as we do this, we're going to be organizing more events, whether it's community dinners  
**[0:21:34-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:34):**  or other various kind of grassroots initiatives where we're excited about continuing to spread  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:42):**  these messages.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:44):**  And when you started at the beginning, how did you start?  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:48):**  Did you have any investors?  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:49):**  Or what was the birth of basically MR&Co?  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:53):**  And what was it like in the first period?  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:56):**  So no, we don't have any outside investors.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:21:58):**  We're self-funded to date.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:00):**  There aren't a lot of investors who truly understand animal agriculture production.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:05):**  There's a lot of investors who understand that sector at the private equity level when  
**[0:22:10-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:10):**  you're a little bit bigger and profitable and you want to scale your infrastructure.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:17):**  Those organizations have been financing the industrial food companies for a very long  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:22):**  time.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:23):**  And from zero to one, this kind of early stage capital, there's very few investors who have  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:29):**  the history of investing in this space.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:32):**  Did you meet and talk to many?  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:35):**  I've, anyone who answers the phone.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:38):**  Probably to all of them.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:40):**  I've talked to a lot.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:41):**  And what are the two most common barriers that you find apart from that they don't know  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:46):**  it?  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:47):**  I can imagine a lot, especially if you tell the story, are interested in it.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:51):**  What has made it so far not a match?  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:55):**  Everyone's very interested in it.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:56):**  The not knowing it.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:22:57):**  So being outside the scope of their current remit or what they're used to investing in,  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:23:04):**  that's really important.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:23:05):**  I mean, that's an easy way for investors to lose a lot of money is investing in things  
**[0:23:09-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:23:09):**  that they don't understand.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:23:11):**  But what that means is it creates a cycle where it's hard to kind of push people into  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:23:16):**  a new thing if they haven't had the experience of doing it.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:23:19):**  If they never tried.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:23:20):**  If they never tried.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:23:21):**  So, you know, I think there, there needs to be some activity on the investor side of them  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:23:25):**  getting up to speed with what this means and learning, you know, on their own.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:23:31):**  But the I'd say the largest challenge once they even possibly do learn about animal agriculture,  
**[0:23:38-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:23:38):**  meat production, et cetera, is the time horizon.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:23:41):**  So you know, we're used in, well, certain sectors of investment are used to a certain  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:23:49):**  return profile and getting their money back in a certain timeframe.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:23:54):**  They're often investing out of out of vehicles that are structured in 10 year time horizons.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:01):**  You know, it's animals take a long time to grow, right?  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:04):**  If we're talking about changing soil health, that's, that's not an overnight process.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:09):**  And you're never going to have the same kind of returns that you might have if you're,  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:13):**  if you're used to investing in a technology company.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:16):**  You know, a cow can take, takes many years to grow and that already would bite into,  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:24):**  you know a 10 year fund.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:26):**  So you know, I think there needs to be some reorientation of expectations of if you want  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:33):**  to invest in animal agriculture or agriculture broadly speaking, and you have to understand  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:38):**  that the time horizon and the return profile is extremely different.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:42):**  Now for me, I think that's exciting because it provides diversification and kind of longer  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:46):**  term stability.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:49):**  But it's, it's, it's just something that people are going to have to, you know, get comfortable  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:54):**  with.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:24:56):**  And get off the, also because a lot of these investments that have this extremely high  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:02):**  return profile, of course also have the extremely high risk profile that we often forget about  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:06):**  because we only hear the stories of the, the 20x returns and 20x exits, et cetera.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:12):**  But yeah, you can, even if you would like to do that, you can only do it with a small  
**[0:25:16-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:16):**  part of your portfolio and yet to be diversified and, and to have a connection with real assets,  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:23):**  agriculture seems to be a very interesting, very interesting angle.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:26):**  And then of course, as far as I'm concerned, regenerative agriculture has a completely  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:32):**  different risk profile than chemical or industrial, however we call it.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:37):**  And in terms of, so yeah, I've been self-funded so far.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:40):**  You're going well, I assume.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:43):**  What's what's up for the next, I mean, you mentioned a lot of education parts, but let's  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:47):**  say until the end of the year in terms of, of, they're going to be, they're going to  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:51):**  be new cities, et cetera, going to be fundamental things inside the company that are changing  
**[0:25:55-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:55):**  as well that you're working on and that you could share.  
**[0:25:58-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:25:59):**  We're looking to expand our team primarily on the marketing side.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:02):**  So if there's any great folks out there who are excited about marketing the future of  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:06):**  agriculture and future of farming, please get in touch.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:11):**  And yeah, the expansion of our customer base.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:13):**  So we're, we've, we've focused a lot on the San Francisco Bay area for our restaurant  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:19):**  food service customers.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:21):**  This by the end of the summer, early fall, we'll be expanding with some really great  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:27):**  owners and distributors in the Los Angeles area.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:31):**  And so that's going to be really exciting to just start working with some other great  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:35):**  chefs and be able to, you know, touch consumers in more areas.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:40):**  And as we, as we expand that those customer bases, that just allows us more resources  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:46):**  to keep producing more content, keep educating and just keep growing our supply chain.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:52):**  So those are the big initiatives.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:54):**  It's all about growing the right way, but slow growing.  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:26:59):**  Slow, like slow.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:00):**  Exactly.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:01):**  We want, we want to grow the right way, which is like our birds like growing slowly, but  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:04):**  you know, at the same time we do want to get bigger so that eventually we can own various  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:08):**  pieces of our supply chain so we can keep bringing our cost structure down.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:12):**  Our, whatever our current pricing is purely based on demand and the economy as a scale  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:19):**  that we get with working with third party supply chain partners.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:24):**  So eventually if we own our own processing plant, if we can contract directly for feed,  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:29):**  you know, all of these pieces allow us to keep reducing our pricing and, you know, make  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:34):**  sure that we can get the most affordable products that is the, you know, healthiest and best  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:40):**  for the land to the most people.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:42):**  And just to get it out of the way, you mentioned feed.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:45):**  I've seen some articles on that.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:47):**  You are sometimes supplementing the feed of the chickens with a non-GMO, almost organic  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:54):**  feed, right?  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:55):**  That's the feed you're mentioning here.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:27:58):**  So the chickens are on pasture 100% of their lives.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:01):**  Like we, from day one to the time they're, so they're brooded out on pasture.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:05):**  They don't even have a barn, right?  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:06):**  There's no barns.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:07):**  There's everything, you know, again, you come to the website and you can see what we mean  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:13):**  when we talk about.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:14):**  Yeah, we'll definitely link it below.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:15):**  It's a great experience.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:16):**  When we say pasture raised, this is what we mean.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:19):**  We mean no barns, movable hoop houses, you know, they're on pasture as early as possible.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:26):**  But that, but so they're getting seeds and bugs and you know, all sorts of things from  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:31):**  the pastures, but they, you still have to supplement with feed that primarily is comprised  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:37):**  of protein and carbohydrates.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:39):**  And right now we work with third party mills to supply that mostly are, you know, most  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:44):**  of the sources of the feed are sourced within California for the West coast production.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:49):**  What we get excited about is as we grow and we can get to what we have larger buying power,  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:28:54):**  we'll be able to work with specific farmers who will be growing feed also in a regenerative  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:29:00):**  process where we're going to be working on no tilling.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:29:03):**  We're working on, you know, crops that are able to create really deep root structures  
**[0:29:09-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:29:09):**  and rotating with the right kind of mix that is always ensuring again, healthy soil, complex  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:29:16):**  aggregates, you know, these deep root systems that help trap more rainwater and you know,  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:29:21):**  sequester carbon.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:29:23):**  So it's just a process, you know, you have to, you can't solve every problem, you know,  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:29:28):**  on day one, but it's exciting that we're, we're getting closer and closer to be able  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:29:31):**  to, you know, keep fixing all these parts of the supply chain, you know, as we get bigger.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:29:36):**  And I want to end with a question there, actually, it's a two folded question.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:29:42):**  That processing part or actually your supply chain or supply stream, as some people in  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:29:47):**  this podcast have called it, is that an interesting angle for impact investors who want to get  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:29:53):**  into the regenerative agriculture space?  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:29:55):**  In your specific case, would it be something that you're looking for for funding at some  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:29:59):**  point, maybe not now, but maybe in the future?  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:02):**  And in general, if you would be a smart impact investor, where would you start if you want  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:07):**  to get into the regenerative agriculture space?  
**[0:30:09-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:09):**  Yeah, great question.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:11):**  So if you want to get into the regenerative agriculture space, I think first you have  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:15):**  to think about what part of that sector you want to focus on.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:20):**  Do you want to focus on, you know, meat production?  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:23):**  Do you want to focus on the grain side of it?  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:26):**  Do you want to focus on aquaculture and, you know, the fish industry?  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:31):**  You know, there are very different parts of regenerative agriculture that all have the  
**[0:30:37-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:37):**  same goals in mind.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:39):**  The insect meal industry as a replacement for soy and feed is a fascinating industry,  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:48):**  something we get very excited about.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:49):**  I know the European industry is, I think, a little further along than the US industry.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:55):**  That's a really fascinating sector.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:30:57):**  When it comes to our supply chain, the milling and the grain side of it, you know, definitely  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:31:02):**  there are third party companies, that's all they do.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:31:05):**  And then, you know, you will, there is a multibillion dollar global feed industry.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:31:11):**  And so that is definitely a sector that is interesting.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:31:15):**  On the processing plant side, it tends to be that those are not necessarily independent  
**[0:31:23-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:31:23):**  businesses that you would want to own, rather they are integrated pieces of an integrated,  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:31:30):**  you know, company.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:31:31):**  And so for us, you know, we will definitely look at, you know, raising capital for, you  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:31:37):**  know, financing those kinds of pieces of our supply chain, you know, when we get to that  
**[0:31:41-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:31:41):**  stage.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:31:42):**  But I think that there's a really exciting opportunity to work with early stage companies  
**[0:31:46-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:31:46):**  like us and others who want to get to that stage and, you know, a small amount of capital  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:31:53):**  in these early stages can really help us accelerate that process.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:31:56):**  Yeah, because that will be actually my final question.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:31:59):**  I said it before, but this is my final one.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:32:01):**  What would you need to double your impact?  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:32:05):**  And it could be investment, it could be much bigger education, it could be nonprofit, it  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:32:09):**  could be what would you envision for the next, let's say, five years to or next few years,  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:32:15):**  actually, because you're still relatively small to really double your impacts of hectares  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:32:19):**  or birds?  
**[0:32:20-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:32:20):**  What would you measure?  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:32:21):**  What would you look at if you want to achieve that?  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:32:23):**  Sure.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:32:24):**  So it would be investment to scale up our regenerative practices so that we could eventually  
**[0:32:32-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:32:32):**  have the scale to justify owning a processing plant, contracting directly with feed mills,  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:32:41):**  so that we could get our cost structure down.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:32:44):**  So the faster we can get our costs down of our product allows us to expand our market  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:32:50):**  dramatically and really opens up new distribution channels and new customers.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:32:55):**  And so the faster we can get our pricing down, closer to where the larger conventional meat  
**[0:33:01-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:33:01):**  businesses are, that allows us to accelerate our impact overnight.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:33:09):**  And do you see the larger meat industry as well?  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:33:12):**  I mean, do you see them under attack basically from all sides?  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:33:15):**  Are their prices going to go up at some point or that's just a race to the bottom until  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:33:20):**  we find out all the scandals and all of that?  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:33:24):**  You know, I think for a lot of the larger meat businesses, they've been operating in  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:33:29):**  a conventional commodity based market.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:33:32):**  There is a global chicken commodity business.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:33:37):**  There are global prices for beef, for chicken, for soy, these commodities.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:33:44):**  So they're already operating in a certain system that won't really allow them to raise  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:33:49):**  prices.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:33:50):**  And there is a market for every price point.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:33:54):**  I don't see KFC necessarily disappearing and KFC would never be able to afford our chicken  
**[0:34:03-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:34:03):**  based on what margins they need to hit and the price point of their products.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:34:06):**  And that's fine.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:34:07):**  You know, I think what I get excited about is, again, it's choice.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:34:12):**  Right now, consumers in the US and elsewhere, they don't have an alternative choice for  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:34:19):**  chicken, for pasture raised other meats that's at a price point that can make sense for them.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:34:25):**  So I think the big industrial food companies see the way that consumers are shifting and  
**[0:34:31-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:34:31):**  they want to get exposure to that, but their core business is still very profitable and  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:34:38):**  will be for quite some time.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:34:39):**  Yeah, no, I agree.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:34:41):**  I think that it's very difficult to find, unless you live next to an realistically managed  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:34:46):**  farm who maybe is processing on the farm, which is almost never the case, it's very  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:34:51):**  difficult to find a meat and livestock that has been grown in the way that we like it  
**[0:34:57-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:34:57):**  to be.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:34:58):**  I think that's difficult in the US, difficult here in Europe, and hopefully that will be  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:35:03):**  a lot easier soon.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:35:05):**  So I want to thank you so much for your time and whatever you shared, and I definitely

**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:35:16):**  plant will be there and the first direct contracts with the feed mills and the first insects,  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:35:21):**  of course.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:35:22):**  Exactly.

**[0:36:30-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:36:30):**  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:36:35):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.

**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:36:40):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:36:45):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:36:49):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:37:51):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:37:56):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:01):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:38:06-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:06):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:08):**  Thank you.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:09):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:38:11-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:11):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:38:17-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:17):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:19):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:24):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:30):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:38:34-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:34):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:36):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:41):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:45):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:49):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:50):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:52):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:55):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:38:58):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:39:00):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/#t=0:39:06):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

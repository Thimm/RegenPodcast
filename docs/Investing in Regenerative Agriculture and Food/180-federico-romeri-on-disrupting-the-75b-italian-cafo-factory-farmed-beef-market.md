### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2022-00-02)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  Everyone knows the animal protein market has to be disruptive, massively, and maybe most  of all the beef market.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:20):**  Take for instance Italy where 85% of beef comes from factory farmed, which means inside  with a lot of inputs and horrible animal welfare practices, plus of course the negative health  outcomes for who consumes that meat.  Plus 50% of the total beef consumption is actually imported, many cases from questionable  markets.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:38):**  Saying this should change is easy but how do you actually do that?  How do you build a supply chain or web from the ground up, B2C vs B2B and how do you work  with the large supermarket chains to get your products in front of more people?  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast.  Talking as if the planet mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:01:02):**  and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  people, local communities, and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:01:24):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:01:59):**  Welcome to another episode.  Today we go deep into the beef market in Italy and how to move it from CAFO factory farmed  to outside on the Alpine meadows as you imagine in these beautiful commercials.  I have the very great pleasure to have the founder of Pascal today with me.  Welcome Federico.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:15):**  Hi Koen, thank you for inviting me.  And to ask the first question we always like to ask at the beginning, how did you end up?  I mean, I don't think you were raised as a shepherd and saw the decline of the shepherds  going with their cows into the Alpine meadows and moving up and down.  I think you were raised in a medium sized city.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:38):**  So how did your interest in the meat market, the beef market, factory farming and at the  end because we're going to talk about that for sure, soil, how did that start?  How did you, cause you're, you're relatively young.  The viewers cannot see that, but we put a picture, like how did you roll into disrupting  the beef market in Italy?  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:55):**  I studied economics.  So another kind of field, but with a lot of connection with the food industry, because  you know, everything it's about money and economics.  So I think that's the starting point.  And to be honest, I made this choice for a selfish purpose probably because I don't have  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:03:19):**  the presumption to change the world.  And I simply tried to make the best possible food choice and to give as many people as  possible the freedom to make the same choice.  And so, you know, for a selfish purpose, as I said, I needed to eat good food in general,  not just meat, but also vegetables and so on.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:03:44):**  And you know, I think that the food chains in general nowadays have a very bad impact  on both the social and environmental dimension.  And in the specific, the meat industry has a very, very bad impact.  And we are trying to build a different supply chain about beef in Italy.  It's a nice answer, but I want to unpack it a bit more as you, I mean, you live in the  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:17):**  north of Italy, relatively close to the Alps.  You probably would have had access yourself if you searched a bit to this kind of meat.  But it's quite a step to go from, I don't know, with friends buying a cow and make sure  it's slaughtered properly, make sure it was raised properly, and then putting your freezer  full and be fine for a year.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:36):**  Going from that to processing many other cows and supplying it to others.  I mean, it's a nice notion to say, I would like others to have that same option.  But that means dedicating your work life to that basically, and probably more in the startup  phase.  So when did that click came from, I want to have access to this, but others don't.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:55):**  I see an opportunity here and I want to start a company and not just like an organization  to promote this kind of food choices.  What made you choose to basically dedicate your work life to this as well?  To be honest, I love to do startup in general, to do new things that are not already done  before.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:05:17):**  And, you know, we focus on meat so far, but it's not my life reason.  You know, I try to change this sector now, but probably I'll do something else in the  future.  You know, the important things for me, it's just giving good impact to the world and about  food or other industries, not that point.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:05:46):**  So I think, you know, it's a sense of ethics probably that guide my steps.  And so let's describe Pasco as I think in Italy, it didn't exist something like that  you have, I would say similar or let's say colleagues in other countries, like special  meat boxes, the ethical butcher in the UK and some other places.  And did you look around in Italy and thought, oh, there's nobody is like supplying ethnically  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:14):**  sourced small producers, obviously proper grazing management.  And we're going to talk about that to the supplier.  You said, OK, let's let's set up Pasco.  If you have to describe now, because you are obviously you're fundraising, you're presenting  it a lot.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:27):**  Like, how do you how do you describe Pasco in a few or a few more sentences?  We started from an objective problem around the 85 percent of meat we consume in Italy  comes from intensive kind of breeding.  And around 50 percent of the entire cake, you know, comes from abroad.  So the supply chain is broken, unsustainable.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:51):**  Yeah, it's broken, both for the methodologies and also for the logistic.  So just to recap, 85 percent, which is I think in Europe more or less the same, even a bit  higher, I think in many places comes from factory farmed cows that never seen the light  of day that are fed on imported feed in many cases.  And we all know the destruction that comes from that.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:14):**  Plus the animal welfare is horrendous.  I mean, you shouldn't feed soy to a ruminant ever.  And then on top of that, you're mentioning 50 percent of the total market actually is  imported, which comes from many, many different places, some places better, many places worse  than what you find close to you.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:29):**  So there's a yeah, there's a broken market there waiting to be disrupted.  And how do you approach that?  So we select small farms who breed cows cattle extensively.  So basically they bring cows to the pasture and they ensure high level of animal welfare  and basically life accordingly to biological needs.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:55):**  You know, following first principles basically.  Yeah, yeah.  It's pretty easy.  You just have to observe nature and just copy and paste everything it's written there.  You don't have to invent anything new.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:10):**  And what we are doing, it's cool about traceability also, because on any piece of meat that you  can you can say which is the exactly farms where that meat comes from.  So we have an innovative traceability system.  And so we have like a livestock team who select the breeders and support them also with free  consultancy and so on.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:42):**  And we are also developing a side project.  For instance, we are talking with No Fencer, a friend of the podcast.  I will link them below, virtual fencing, if you want to know more.  Very innovative.  And of course, for Alpine Meadows, potentially disrupting and interesting.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:59):**  You can do interesting things.  Yeah.  So first of all, we select breeders who are already integrated with the territory, with  the environment and we try to improve, further their farm.  Then we buy cows.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:17):**  The slaughter is very close to the farmer.  We have selected breeders in six regions in Italy, in the northern and central part of  the country.  And we have many slaughterhouses in any region in order to make that process very, very short.  Is that an issue?  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:39):**  Because we had a full interview with Dan Miller, which I will link below as well, on slaughter  facilities in the US where cows have to travel seven, eight, 10 hours to get to a slaughter  facility.  And in many cases, it's a huge industrial one and they don't do the cuts you want or  they don't have space.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:55):**  So in Italy, is that not an issue?  Can you find slaughterhouses that work well, of course, but that are nearby these farms  or is that becoming challenging also in Italy?  We have them because we have also a regulation approved by the Ministry and also these slaughterhouses  entering to these regulations.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:14):**  So they're still there.  Slaughterhouses are still there.  That infrastructure luckily didn't disappear yet.  Okay.  Okay.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:21):**  That's fundamental.  So you have them slaughtered nearby.  Yeah.  And then what happens?  And then we transport the meat to a central plant basically in Brescia, in Lombardy.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:37):**  And then we process the meat in different cuts.  And we distributed it.  We started in 2019 on B2C channels.  So the e-commerce basically.  And then we approached also the B2B channels because our value proposition, it's not about  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:01):**  the distribution of the product, but about the product itself.  So we don't care a lot where the product goes.  The only important thing is that with the product, it's also the message, the vision.  We want to give the customer the freedom to make a choice different with their money,  adding value to the system.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:32):**  Because we think that the biggest way in order to change things, it's consciousness in consumption.  Yeah.  So you start...  There's so much sandbag there.  I'm assuming you obviously pay more to the farmers than they would, and I would love  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:50):**  to explore more also why they're not doing this themselves, like what's holding them  back.  And then there's a very interesting piece we're going to get to, which is B2C, so direct  to consumers online, which obviously everybody...  You can keep all the margins, et cetera.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:01):**  I think many people underestimate how expensive it is to get things in a fresh way to people's  house.  And then you went to...  You started talking to the big supermarkets, actually talking to, you're actually selling  through them.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:13):**  And you said, yeah, we don't really care if they do the distribution as long as the message  gets our meaning.  It has to be in a Pascal way presented.  It cannot go into some kind of commodity market and then be white labeled.  Is that an issue actually?  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:27):**  Let's start with the question of trying...  I'm imagining you're trying to sell the whole animal.  The fact that you're doing obviously B2C, you can steer that.  You can have the boxes, you can have pieces together.  Then moving to B2B, is that an issue?  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:41):**  Do you get left over with certain pieces more than other, or is the deal with a big supermarket,  look, you have to take everything and that's the deal because we're slaughtering animals,  not pieces of animal?  Yeah, this is a very difficult thing.  As you said, we buy just entire animals.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:59):**  And so I think the secret in order to sell everything in a good way is having a lot of  clients in different sector.  For instance, butchers, of course, large distribution stores, and also, for instance, burgers stores.  So you have to have a lot of clients in order to make any cats without problem.  And of course, at the beginning of this, it was a big problem.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:13:36):**  But now we already have a good amount of clients in order to sell everything in a good way.  And for the producers you work with, what holds them back to do this themselves?  Like why, if they already work with a local butcher to slaughter, basically, then what  keeps them from selling it themselves compared to selling the animal to you?  Is that much easier?  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:05):**  Is that like the marketing piece, obviously distribution?  What makes them wanting to work with you, apart from that you probably pay hopefully  early and good prices?  Yeah, I mean, there are no large enough fields in order to scale these kind of farms.  So if you want to do extensive kind of breeding in Italy, you have to keep your farm small  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:27):**  or medium at the maximum.  You cannot, you know,  What is medium?  How many animals are we talking about with medium?  In average between 100 and 300 animals per cattle.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:40):**  So not a lot.  And you know, if you want to scale it, you have to do intensive because there are not  enough big spaces in order to put all these animals at the pasture in Italy.  Because yeah, it becomes a herd basically.  Yeah.  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:58):**  Of course.  So they are relatively small.  Yeah.  So the local farmers in this dimension cannot build, for instance, managerial activities,  cannot build a sales team, cannot organize in a very well system, logistics and supply  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:15:20):**  chain.  They, you know, the intensive breeding have short term return on investment because the  animal life cycle is shortened.  I mean, you have an already animal maybe in one year and a half.  In this case, maybe you need three years or so to double.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:15:45):**  And you cannot either do marketing and communication in a good way because you're maybe you're  probably two people, three people, four people at the maximum.  And you don't have the know how and the capabilities in order to make the value proposition and  all the values that your farms has.  And so they have very big problems about commercial activities.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:16:12):**  They sell to private people, as you said before, that they buy the entire cows and put into  the refrigerator or to local butchers.  But anytime it's like a bargain with the butcher.  And so they raise cows, but they don't be sure to sell the whole production.  And what we do is, of course, support the breeder, pay them more compared to the market  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:16:46):**  and ensure to buy the whole production.  So the breeder can think just to breed and to improve the methodologies in breeding,  pasture and so on, animal welfare.  And yeah, I think this is the best way in order.  So any step of the supply chain focus just on its own.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:09):**  His own specialization.  Yeah.  So how has been the impact for some of the breeders, like how like you're relatively  young as a company, three years, you mentioned 2019, like some of the oldest ones you've  been working with, like how has that changed?  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:24):**  Has that fundamentally changed their business outcome or like have they hired new people  or gone back to the land?  Like what has been the impact of offering this sales channel basically or this secure,  well-paid sales channel?  Have you seen impact on the land or impact in this case with the communities?  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:43):**  Yes, of course.  They're changing, they're growing.  For instance, of course, we just select breeders who already are at a very high level.  But for instance, they cultivate a lot of fields with conventional methodologies and  they're changing to organic methodologies, for instance.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:18:06):**  They're buying more animals.  There are many abandoned fields to do pasture, mainly in the Alps and they are recovering  them.  But yeah, we started in 2019 in two people and me and my co-founder were both economics  students and probably we couldn't distinguish a donkey from a cow at the beginning.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:18:37):**  And so just in the last year, we built a strong team about livestock and we are getting results  now and next year we are seeing more.  And just the impact of animals on, like you mentioned, their abandoned pastures in the  Alps, like what happens if they're abandoned?  Why is the animal impact there or is the animal impact important?  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:19:04):**  And if yes, why?  Yeah, there is a very big biodiversity system related to the pasture.  So insects, other animals, plants and so on.  And according to WWF, we are losing around 20% of semi-natural spaces because we are  stopping doing the practice of pasture with animals.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:19:35):**  And so I think that the soil can erode, first of all, because there are fields without trees,  without anything.  So if there are no animals who fertilize the soil and so on, there are systemic damages,  basically.  And in other cases, simply the forest or the trees can get back and get the pasture.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:05):**  And what are your plans on that side, like on the grazing?  There's a lot of discussion, obviously.  We had a lot of conversations here in the podcast as well.  What do you see there as potential to work with these farmers that are already at a relatively  high level?  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:21):**  Like, what do you see that you can do with them over the next years to improve grazing,  to start measuring soil organic matter, the impact of the animals on the land, also biodiversity,  etc.  What are your plans on, let's say, the side effect of having animals on the land in a  proper way?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:38):**  Yeah, we are working with universities also, for instance, the University of Florence.  And first of all, we are trying to implement a measurement system into the fields in order  to understand exactly how the amount, for instance, about organic matter into the soil  or all these things.  So we would like to collect data, first of all.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:08):**  And it's pretty obvious that following the nature path, as we said before, is the right  choice because you have to copy and paste.  But we would like also to measure the data in order to understand specifically where  we are going.  How are the farmers interested in that?  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:34):**  How are they receptive?  When you come in, of course, to guys that don't distinguish a donkey from a cow, you  say, maybe grazing could be different.  How do they take that?  Or what is your strategy there to take them along, let's say, in this journey of discovering  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:51):**  how to get more biomass, more biodiversity, more life, more healthier cows, better grass  management, etc., but not wanting to be pushed off the farm as go back to the city and go  do something useful?  I mean, our breeders follow us because they trust us because we prove that we are trustable.  But we explain to them also that from an economic point of view, in the long term, the nature  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:22:23):**  path is the best one.  Because in the short term, with chemicals and so on, of course, you can improve the  quantity of product that you make.  But in the long term, it's all about fertility of the soil, it's all about biodiversity.  And I think that now, and quality, of course, nowadays, sustainability, it's probably a  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:22:53):**  matter of, it's an optional choice.  In 10 years, maybe 15, 20, 30, I don't know, but it will happen.  Sustainability, it will be a mandatory choice.  So either these or you don't eat.  And what about the quality?  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:11):**  Do you do I mean, obviously, you are eating your own padding, let's say you're one of  the clients, but what do clients say, customers say?  What do you have you seen?  Are you doing any potential research in the future on like, say, the nutrients compared  to and then we get to the supermarket piece, which is fascinating.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:29):**  But like next to the ones like imagine the supermarket in the shelf, there is the Pascal  aisle.  And then next next to it is, let's say the factory farm ones, etc.  Like how would you describe the difference between the two in taste, in color, in nutrients?  Like how do you how do you how would you describe that to someone that hasn't tasted the difference  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:49):**  yet?  Yeah, the taste is original.  I mean, you feel the meat.  And about properties of the meat, it really depends on the pasture on the animal on the  zone on the area.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:05):**  There are many factors that can influence these.  And we, of course, make averages in order to, you know, give data in general to our  customer that these data are very, very higher than the average of the conventional market  about protein, about many things that are contained in the meat, vitamins, etc.  And so how has been the response from from customers when they taste?  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:39):**  I mean, how do you get a lot of repeat when you're growing as a company?  So I'm imagining, yes, like people are discovering like how meat used to taste or how meat could  taste, etc.  How has been response from the market?  Yeah, they love, of course, the taste of the meat.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:56):**  But I think that our customer may be bypassed because of the value proposition.  So they like to spend their money in this way.  They like to give money to breeders who follow this kind of methodology.  They like to ensure animals are good life, basically, and all these things.  And also in marketing communication, we put a lot of focus in about these topics.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:27):**  We don't focus a lot on the product that is very, very good, but it's OK.  We focus mainly on the side effect that your choice brings.  And so then how did you and why?  And let's let's talk about the details there decided to start selling in the big supermarkets,  the big ones, a quote unquote enemies, but the large ones that are selling all the low  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:52):**  quality ones as well.  How did that happen?  Did they reach out to you?  Did you reach out to them?  Why didn't you stay in?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:58):**  Let's sell directly online.  Let's keep that, let's say, relationship completely with us.  Why did you decide to go to the large distribution centers to supermarkets, which are massive  in Italy?  I want to understand, like there are a few really, really, really big ones.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:13):**  Yeah, mainly in this in this country, the e-commerce market is not scalable at all.  If you have one product, mainly because, you know, people won't buy meat on one website,  fish on another, vegetables on another one and just wait maybe two or three days for  the delivery.  So you reached sort of a limit of what was possible.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:40):**  I think that the problem is not distribution.  I think the problem is production and consumption.  So we have to, first of all, I think, educate the customers because they give money to producers  in order to produce.  And I mean, we have a producer and customer that should be educated, of course.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:04):**  And the distribution just follow the education of these groups.  I mean, I don't think that the big distribution and large distribution are the root of the  problem.  I think it's just a consequence.  And so you started talking to them or they started talking to you.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:24):**  And then what does it mean for your margins?  Obviously, you keep more of it, but you have more costs if you're selling directly.  How does that work in large supermarkets, because what you don't want is become the  discounted article, like the one day they get people in with like some of the veggies  are always used and some of the meat as well to pull people into the supermarket.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:42):**  And then we hope you buy some brand things that have more interesting margins.  How do you dance with such a big player that obviously is able to push or not because they  are massive compared to such a small player as you?  Yeah, we are some people in the large distribution sector and large distribution love our product.  We are not a commodity.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:28:08):**  We are not just about margin for them, but we are also about branding.  So in our case, our margin is very good.  And taking into consideration the deliveries that are very, very, the B2C deliveries that  cost a lot in this country, the margin is pretty much the same.  That's a fair margin.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:28:37):**  And yeah, as I said, the distribution brings Pascal into their store also because the branding  and because they love to associate their brand with someone who tries to bring value to the  environment to the small breeders and so on.  Do you see people then buying it in the supermarket and some of them buying it then directly from  you or they stay in the supermarket?  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:02):**  Because as you said, it's easier to buy your fish or veggies and everything in one place  and bring it home immediately.  Or is there some like some linkage between the B2C and the B2B?  So we will be in 220 stores by the end of June.  But so far, we are just in 25 supermarkets.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:23):**  So we don't have enough data in order to say that.  To say too much about that.  I hope that yeah, they will buy in the supermarkets and then online.  Yeah.  But for your margins, what you mentioned, it doesn't really matter.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:36):**  So it's also I mean, it's a lot less hassle, obviously, if you sell it to one supermarket  chain and then it's they do the distribution, which you mentioned a few times you don't  want to or you don't think it needs to be reinvented.  That's not where the root cause is.  The root causes are food choices and the production methods.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:54):**  And so you what would you say to like say, for sure, you're talking to them as well in  Milan and other places to the finance world to the people looking at and in some cases  financing the large industrial, very intensive and very extractive meat industry.  Let's say we're in a theater.  Let's change the setting a bit.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:15):**  We're in a theater, we're on stage and this is a meat conference in Italy and we're having  this conversation there.  What would you tell them?  What would you tell them when they walk out of that room?  What they should do or what they should be looking at?  
**[0:30:27-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:27):**  What they should be digging a bit deeper?  What would be obviously without giving investment advice, but what would be your direction for  the finance world that is involved in the meat industry to go to?  This is a very difficult question.  I think the problem is rooted into the system and the ideas and mentality.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:49):**  So I think that until we change that, you know, going to the financial system or others.  We have them in that audience.  They're sitting there.  What would you tell them, like nature is always right or visit this, visit this and this or  look at that?  
**[0:31:09-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:09):**  Where would you guide them?  What to read or what to taste?  What would you tell them to how to influence or nudge that mentality?  How can we get them to be open to think differently?  Unfortunately, I think the fastest way is just to mention, you know, a wallet.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:30):**  Because you know, sustainability nowadays, it's also an investment opportunity.  So what do you tell them?  You tell them like, look, it makes more sense economically?  Yeah, it makes more sense economically.  You don't see these in the next five years, maybe, but you will see in the next 10.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:48):**  I mean, now sustainability, it's an optional choice and it's an investment opportunity.  When will be a monetary choice won't be anymore an investment opportunity.  It will be, you know, a needed opportunity.  You have to do this in order to eat or to drink or to breathe, you know, a good air  and so on.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:14):**  So you're saying it's the ideal moment.  It's the you want to create a bit of fear of missing out a bit of FOMO of like, look,  this is an investment opportunity now.  It might take a few years, but you don't want to miss out on this wave.  Yeah, I think that fear of missing out will be a good way.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:32):**  We have a fear of missing out in many sectors where, you know, it's there is no sense in  order to have FOMO.  But in this sector, probably the FOMO is very needed.  And what would you do if we switch the conversation?  You are in charge of a large investment fund, let's say a billion euros, and you can invest  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:58):**  it anywhere with any length of time as well.  So you don't need to be restricted to the traditional seven, eight year fund, etc.  You can invest it however you like.  What would you focus on?  Is it the animal protein side or is maybe something completely different?  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:14):**  The oceans?  What would you focus if you are not running PASCO, but actually running this investment  fund to put money to work in regeneration, in sustainability?  Yeah, first of all, investing in PASCO and then probably just buying resources.  I will buy fields, I will buy forestry, I will buy, you know, water resources and so  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:40):**  on.  And I would try to protect them and get the maximum from them at the same time respecting  them.  I mean, I think that we have to build a production and consumption system that are consistent  with the biological systems.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:05):**  So I would like just to, you know, experiment in natural places how to produce and consume  in a very consistency way with the natural systems.  And would you do that in Italy or in other places?  Where would you focus your attention?  I think I will differentiate it.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:31):**  So I will do it in different places in order to have different opportunities about contingency  in general in order to have different characteristics of soil, areas, zones and so on.  And what would you like to experiment most with?  Is it the animal integration?  Is it extreme composting technology?  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:56):**  Is it, I don't know, remote sensing using satellite?  What would you, if you had unlimited resources like now, what would you experiment?  What would be your first experiment to say, okay, what would we push on?  Probably agroforestry.  So you know, a place where there are at the same time trees, animals, plants, water and  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:21):**  so on and try to find a balance into a system basically.  Try to find a balance with the nature of things that surround you.  And then I'm sorry we take your fund away, but we give you a magic wand where you can  change one thing in the ag and food space or in the land use space or sea even.  Of course, you can choose that.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:44):**  What would you change overnight?  Would you take out all antibiotics from the system or all animals outside?  We've had that answer a long time ago.  Actually somebody mentioned that.  I think it requires Valley Farm, one of the co-founders.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:57):**  What would you do or something completely different like food traceability on all animal  protein or all food or CO2 labels?  What would you, being so deep into all the sides actually, all the way down to the consumer,  but also the big distribution and the production, if you had a magic wand, but you could only  change one thing, what would you do?  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:36:16):**  I think it's a compromise choice.  In any case, this choice will have a lot of effect on the system, on society and so on.  And I will go stronger on it and I will totally exterminate the chemical products.  Of course, we will have low production in the next few years and maybe many crises also  about anger and so on.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:36:49):**  But I think that in the long run, it will have very positive effect for the ecosystem  in general, stopping using chemical products on groundwater and so on.  And what is exciting for you?  I mean, you're going from 200 or from 25 to 220 stores.  That's pretty exciting.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:12):**  But the rest of the year, we're talking in late spring 2022.  How does the rest of the year for PASCO look like?  What are big milestones or things you're looking forward to and also maybe a bit scared about?  I mean, we would like to still add value to any steps of the supply chain.  So from the breeders, we are trying to work with institutions.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:34):**  So for instance, European Union in order to find funds in order to make the transition  faster.  And as I mentioned before, we would like to implement the partnership with Nofensa and  maybe also Roomi.  I mean, all the tools that can bring value.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:38:00):**  And then of course, finding more clients because more clients we have, more producers and farmers  that we can value.  And in the middle, we would like to build a customized software in order to bring all  the data about the supply chain together, about transportation, about the farmers, livestock,  pasture and so on, and try to make a life cycle assessment of the whole supply chain  
**[0:38:32-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:38:32):**  in order to understand the real impact in order, of course, to CO2 emission, but also  to systemic benefit or malus to the system.  So we'd like to measure the biodiversity of the environment where our farmers work, the  quality of the soil, the quality of the water and so on.  And we'd like to do it in blockchain if possible.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:01):**  I will definitely link it below.  If it's out, when this is out, we did a long interview on life cycle assessments with Mariko,  which was fascinating.  She worked on, she's the co-author of the one that they did on white oak pastures, which  I think is the first LCA on a multi-species farm.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:19):**  And also the first that actually did soil analysis and included the sequestration potential  in a life cycle assessment, which is quite scary because it means until now we never  did that.  And we had a long discussion on the multi-species side, but also the carbon focus and probably  a bit too much focus on carbon and also on the emission side and what needs to happen,  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:38):**  let's say to make them much more robust and much stronger because they only tell half  of the story at the moment.  And the other half is either based on very old models or based on data that we simply  don't have.  I will link below.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:52):**  So the roomy, which is interesting to find out obviously more and no fence, virtual fencing  side of things.  So I think there's a lot to do.  And is that the story that as the last question, is that the limiting factor at the moment  the amount of customers you have or because if you had more customers, you could easily  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:08):**  scale up with more of your farmers, like there's more space there.  Or is it also a limitation of finding the farmers or you say, no, that's there.  We have enough space, enough animals, enough growth, easy growth, let's say.  The main limitation nowadays are about operation because, you know, it's not a software is  a real life supply chain.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:30):**  So it's not that needs to be fresh.  Otherwise it's the case.  Yeah, there is a it's not that you're selling almonds that are dry and you're fine or software.  Like you said, you're selling something that is literally alive.  And we are, you know, working also through many geopolitical contingency, for instance,  
**[0:40:51-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:51):**  you know, the pandemic and the war, the price of raw materials went up a lot in the last  six months, basically.  So we had a very big problem about packaging because our package is out cartoon and how  to and it's both recyclable, of course.  But we bought around 3000 carton.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:18):**  And you say carton boxes, boxes, right.  And they were not working, basically.  So we lost a couple of months with clients such as scope and others because we couldn't  package the meat.  And the packaging industry, the cardboard is very difficult to get hold of.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:41):**  Yeah, no, it's not.  It's not a software that you can just switch on a few servers at Amazon and you're fine.  And at one time you have a lot of producer and not so many clients.  Then one week later, you have too many clients, not so many producer.  And you have to keep a balance, you know, growing.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:01):**  It's very, very difficult because you have to be always in balance and at the same time  growing month per month.  So is that what you enjoy?  You mentioned at the beginning that I like to create things that are not there.  You're smiling a lot now.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:15):**  You cannot see that on the you cannot hear that now.  Maybe you can actually.  Is that what you enjoy or is it also uncomfortable at some point?  Yeah, I love our uncertainty.  I mean, I don't like things routine and otherwise it would have worked at a bank in Milan.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:34):**  Yeah, yeah, I will do something else, of course.  And so.  Do you see with this crisis?  I mean, I keep saying last question, but with these crises on pricing, et cetera, and prices  of inputs, in many cases, I think people have seen the crazy fertilizer prices already last  
**[0:42:54-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:54):**  year and now, of course, with the war even more.  Do you see like differences in the low input farmers you work with and let's say the high,  high, high input ones like other prices getting closer to each other in the supermarkets?  Do you see any of that yet?  Like prices are being changed?  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:12):**  Do you see the of less because for instance, wildfarm that talk to recently, they say,  yeah, we use so little inputs that we are, of course, we're suffering because electricity  and petrol and other things are packaging, but it's not the raw like the input input  prices for us.  We don't have so much of that.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:28):**  So we're less suffering than our competitors.  And maybe finally, the prices of bread are getting close to each other of the low input  ones.  Do you see that as well?  Or is that too early?  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:38):**  Yeah, I think that's a very interesting thing because, you know, our supply chain is very  self sufficient.  Also in production of raw materials such as cereals.  Of course, our cows are raised extensively.  So the amount of cereals they eat, it's very, very small.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:56):**  It's like about the 20% of the total ratio of the nutrition of the cow.  And all these cereals are basically all made in the farms, GMO free and so on.  And in the conventional beef supply chain, the amount of cereals that the cows eat, it's  around the 80%.  That's four times.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:22):**  So we go from 20 to 80.  Just for your calculation.  And they're not they're not growing on the farm itself, for sure.  It's the opposite.  And these supply chains are very dependent about importing cereals, for instance, from  
**[0:44:39-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:39):**  Russia, Ukraine, and so on.  And in this case, you know, when there is a war and a problem about raw material in general,  these prices go up a lot.  And the price of, you know, conventional meat at the supermarket went pretty much close  to our meat.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:00):**  So you pay basically the same for a product that it's completely different.  That's fascinating.  Do you see that?  Do you see I mean, you're in relatively small supermarkets, but do you see now that that  helps like in terms of sales?  
**[0:45:15-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:15):**  And maybe also in general, the whole discussion on this self sufficiency and food sovereignty  and should we import a lot of stuff?  I know in many European countries, it has been a big discussion on fertilizer on grain  and wheat, etc.  Do you have you seen an uptick since the beginning of the year in terms of in terms of sales?  
**[0:45:32-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:32):**  Or is it very difficult to see?  As you said, we are still in so few supermarkets.  So I think we'll see it in the next year, in the next few years.  And that's the reason why I was suggesting to investors to invest in this way.  Because this is an example of how, you know, a good supply chain for the system.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:46:01):**  It's also good for the for the wallet for the investors, because, you know, one of our  goals is to build a totally sufficient supply chain.  So without anything imported or exported outside the supply chain.  It's a very interesting.  You protect a lot yourself from whatever happens in the world.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:46:32):**  Yeah, communities, you know, it's a I think many people underestimate how many madness,  madness, disease, there's a lot there.  And I want to be conscious of your time as well and look forward to speak to you in the  future and see how far you got and what kind of very interesting experiments and larger  than experiments you have been implementing.

**[0:47:49-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:47:49):**  Thanks again and see you next time.  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:48:16-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:48:16):**  There are 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to  put money to work in regenerating soils.  And I've been following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016.  We thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:48:32-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:48:32):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:48:42-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:48:42):**  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  
**[0:48:50-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:48:50):**  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:10):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  Is this course free?  No.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:24):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:44):**  Thank you.  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to ride along.  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:00):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soy builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:20):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:34):**  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2022-08-30)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:14):**  Something we don't talk about enough, the deep racism in agriculture and food and honestly  also in the regenerative agriculture movement.  We stand on the shoulders of giants in the indigenous farming and land management space,  
**[0:00:26-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:26):**  but choose not to mention them.  All practices we currently call regenerative are not new but have been around for a long,  long time and we choose broadly not to acknowledge that and look away when it comes to thorny  
**[0:00:37-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:37):**  topics like land ownership, access to land, access to finance, access to conferences and  access to podcasts like this.  So let's get real and uncomfortable and discuss things like the real origin story of the green  
**[0:00:48-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:00:48):**  revolution, the black farming movement in the US and the deep roots of colonization  in the agriculture space and what we can and have to learn from that.  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:01:05-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:01:05):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:01:19):**  Try my focus on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  have their roots in how we treat our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear  and consume.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:01:29):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  To make it easy for fans to support our work we launched our membership community and so  
**[0:01:41-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:01:41):**  many of you have joined us as a member.  Thank you.  If our work created value for you and if you have the means and only if you have the means,

**[0:02:04-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:04):**  Today we have a very special episode where we have one of our first guests back on the  podcast.  She was guest in the episode number 18.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:12):**  So that's almost four and a half years ago.  And Liz Carlyle has written a new book, actually has written a lot in the meantime, but we  had her last time for the Lento Underground, which I would anybody strongly suggest to  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:24):**  read it.  But she's back now with Healing Grounds, which has been an amazing book.  I really, really enjoyed it.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:29):**  And I'm very happy to have Liz back on the podcast.  Welcome.  I'm delighted to be here and to reconnect, touch base.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:36):**  Yeah, a lot has happened in this space.  We're going to get to that as well because you've been observing this space, quote unquote,  the state of regeneration space for a while as well.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:46):**  But first, let's start what triggered you to to write another book?  I mean, it's always a massive undertaking.  I think I've never done it.  
**[0:02:54-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:02:54):**  I've just seen it from outside and far away.  Instead of articles or essays or papers, I mean, you didn't have to write this book.  What made this book a book that had to be written and had to be written by you?  
**[0:03:08-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:08):**  Yeah, that last question is a tough one.  I don't know if I have the answer to that, you know, whether I'm the right author for  this book, but I did feel a real sense of urgency about this book.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:18):**  And I think it's, you know, it's been a long journey for me trying to understand this idea  of regeneration and regenerative agriculture and what is really required of us as people  to regenerate, you know, soil carbon, which is sort of where I started this investigation  
**[0:03:39-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:39):**  12 years ago as a researcher and writer.  But I've just continually tried to understand the deeper layers of regeneration and in many  cases the root causes of why we have an extractive agriculture in the first place that would  
**[0:03:54-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:03:54):**  take carbon out of soil and put it into the atmosphere.  Why on earth did society get to a place where that somehow made sense?  And so this book digs further back in history to understand this as a process that got started  
**[0:04:09-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:09):**  several hundred years ago.  And I think also, you know, for me has a sense of urgency around the social change that's  necessary for us to solve the climate problems in agriculture, which I now understand to  
**[0:04:24-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:24):**  be really, really deeply wedded to questions of social justice.  Yeah, it's been fascinating.  I tumbled into the Regen movement as well about 12 years ago on the carbon side and  
**[0:04:37-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:37):**  on peeling the onion further and further you get to why would it make sense to unleash  all that carbon, which has such a crucial role in the soil.  And we know now how to, and we have known before how to restore that and why don't we  
**[0:04:54-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:04:54):**  or haven't we done at scale yet?  And I think there's, yeah, it's not about the techniques.  The techniques are there and we know how to do it.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:03):**  Let's say we know the scientific research and et cetera, et cetera.  But the question is why, why haven't we?  And you go back also to a very interesting, of course, I will put links to the book below.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:13):**  One of the things that really struck me apart from really reading about the history of the  regeneration movement or the history of, of Regen, which goes way further than we normally  hear let's say, but one moment was very, very fascinating on the green revolution where  
**[0:05:29-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:29):**  that started.  We've all known like in Mexico in that research Institute, they started pushing on certain  inputs, et cetera, but that's not the full story.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:37):**  Like the story started actually before that and had a very different intent and a Rockefeller  funding, Rockefeller foundation funding that started the whole thing had a very different  intent when they started.  
**[0:05:46-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:05:46):**  So shall we unpack that a bit and then go to the rest of the book?  Yeah, I was fascinated by the story as well because you know, when I first started getting  into regenerative agriculture or organic agriculture, which is what I was first introduced to, I  
**[0:06:02-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:02):**  pretty early on heard about this kind of boogie man, the bad guy on the other side, Norman  Borlaug, who had won the Nobel peace prize in the early seventies for his work on hybrid  grain.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:17):**  And I learned that Borlaug's approach was, you know, very, very high yielding monocultures  of grain using high inputs of fossil fuel based chemicals, meaning fertilizers, herbicides,  other kinds of pesticides, as well as intensive irrigation.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:35):**  And so, you know, for me, just getting into the organic farming movement and agroecology,  I was interested in an approach that was much lower input, accessible to people in all kinds  of environments rather than this really high input.  
**[0:06:49-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:06:49):**  You know, the point is just to get high yielding corn or wheat under ideal conditions.  So I had learned about Norman Borlaug, you know, I knew he was affiliated with the Rockefeller  program and this thing was called the Green Revolution, and it had undermined the livelihoods  
**[0:07:05-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:05):**  of smallholder farmers around the world who couldn't access these expensive fertilizers  and herbicides and irrigation.  And so the, you know, the market that they had counted on for what they produced fell  
**[0:07:18-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:18):**  out, you know, from under them as these high input producers kind of captured the global  export market.  So I had heard about that story, and I understood this kind of struggle between two visions  
**[0:07:30-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:30):**  of agriculture, one that was very, you know, high input and sort of technology intensive  and more accessible to people with more resources, and one that was sort of more democratic and  low input and ecological and in my view, consistent with what we need to do on climate and other  
**[0:07:47-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:07:47):**  ecological challenges.  But I think the story I hadn't learned was that even within the Rockefeller Foundation,  prior to Borlaug's ascent to power, there was a debate about what it meant to, you know,  
**[0:08:05-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:05):**  pursue technical assistance for agricultural producers in Mexico in the early 20th century.  Not everybody believed in a high input approach.  And even when Borlaug did ultimately win the day on pursuing, you know, a lot of chemicals  
**[0:08:20-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:20):**  rather than compost and cover crops and things we now talk about in regenerative agriculture  circles, there was this massive resistance movement in Mexico, led by indigenous people,  that not only has shaped Mexican history and Latin American history, but actually led to  
**[0:08:36-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:36):**  the creation of the field of agroecology, my research field, and has also shaped history  throughout the Americas and throughout the world.  Because it was those smallholders and indigenous people in Mexico fighting Borlaug's vision,  
**[0:08:52-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:08:52):**  who articulated the alternative that now I think has so much relevance within climate  discussions and discussions of a more ecological agriculture, which for them also was about,  you know, having power over their own livelihoods and communities.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:08):**  Yeah, that's fascinating to see, of course, when it was, but also, I think the original  funding even was focused on that work to understand the agroecology or whatever it was called  at that moment.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:22):**  And of course, the terminology is different.  But the original funding or original project was to understand that better and to research  that.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:31):**  And then somehow it became, it took a right or left turn, whatever you want to call it,  but took a different turn by certain influences to go on the high input, high output.  But let's not forget many of the these quote unquote, peasant farmers had an incredible  
**[0:09:46-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:46):**  high output, with a very, very low input, like the whole feeding the world discussion.  Let's not go there, because that's irrelevant.  And in many cases, nonsense.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:09:55):**  They were out competing everything, but they were just simply pushed out of the way.  Because of the input side, because of the hybrids, because of much, but the original  idea of the Rockefeller project seemed to be actually quite focused on agroecology and  
**[0:10:08-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:08):**  understanding why these peasants and smallholder farmers were so incredibly productive over  time without losing fertility without a lot of inputs.  And then somehow, they took another turn and got into the high input train.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:24):**  What can we learn there?  What can we learn?  Because it was a very small funding and was a very small amount actually at the time and  
**[0:10:31-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:31):**  probably a bit more and but now even less that sort of changed the course of history.  What can we learn there from very good intentions?  I think if we look at the original plan was very agroecology focused that rotations of  
**[0:10:42-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:42):**  composting, let's learn from solar farmers.  And then 10 years later, or I don't know the timeframe, whoop, it went all the way to the  other side and became this extreme colonization for us that that has cost us a lot.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:10:55):**  Yeah, that's a great question.  I think that's absolutely the right question because I do think this tale of the Rockefeller  Foundation's Mexican agricultural program is a cautionary tale for funders and investors  
**[0:11:11-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:11):**  in regenerative agriculture because you're absolutely right at the beginning when this  program was first getting started in the 30s.  If you sort of think about the cast of characters involved, it wasn't too different from, you  
**[0:11:25-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:25):**  know, I'm in the United States, you know, sort of like Bernie Sanders type of supporters,  you know, Elizabeth Warren type of supporters.  It was a group of progressives who were connected within philanthropic circles and who are also  
**[0:11:37-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:37):**  pretty connected to the New Deal project and the idea of big social programs that were  public in the 30s coming out of the Depression, who, by and large, really admired the Mexican  Revolution and the land reform that happened in Mexico as Mexico transitioned from these  
**[0:11:56-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:11:56):**  big haciendas, these big estates where people were essentially all but enslaved and these  large tracts of land were owned by just, you know, a few people in the country to, you  know, this land reform where a lot of people got their own parcel to farm and there was  
**[0:12:13-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:13):**  this more kind of, you know, food sovereignty type of vision for how agriculture and the  economy would proceed in Mexico.  The Mexican agricultural program of the Rockefeller Foundation was originally full of people who  
**[0:12:26-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:26):**  believed in that vision.  They saw it as sort of consistent with Jeffersonian American democracy, this idea that a nation  of small farmers is, you know, the basis of a democratic nation and this is a good basis  
**[0:12:39-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:39):**  for the economy to have people having access to their own ability to produce food for their  own communities.  So that's where the Mexican agricultural program started is how do we support these small farmers  
**[0:12:52-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:12:52):**  who've just gotten on their ajitos, these small tracts of land that people got as part  of the land reform, with technical assistance that's appropriate to them.  So knowing that these aren't people with the money to buy commercial fertilizers, a lot  
**[0:13:05-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:05):**  of these people don't have access to irrigation, they might be at high elevation.  And so the original, you know, pursuit was how do we support corn farmers because that  was the subsistence crop?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:17):**  And how do we support them with things like, yeah, composting, cover crops, all these things  that we think of as regenerative or organic or sustainable.  And what changed?  
**[0:13:27-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:27):**  You know, Norman Borlaug, when he first got there, he was kind of, by all accounts, a  little bit arrogant.  He was from Iowa, he'd seen the beginnings of industrial, high yielding agriculture,  
**[0:13:39-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:39):**  and he really did believe that this sort of technologically driven approach to higher  yields was a better way.  And he had a lot of disdain for small farmers and for sort of biological strategies rather  
**[0:13:52-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:13:52):**  than chemical ones.  But when he first showed up at the Mexican agricultural program as this young plant pathologist  talking about how he'd rather work with, you know, larger landowners growing wheat than  
**[0:14:04-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:04):**  the small farmers growing corn, he was kind of marginalized.  And in fact, he actually threatened to quit because he was so pissed off about having  to work with small farmers who he thought would have looked different.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:18):**  It's interesting to think about it.  Norbert Borlaug would have quit.  And back to Iowa and work there.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:25):**  I mean, I don't think you could have stopped the force.  I mean, there was a I mean, we we can idolize about that and at the same time.  But it's interesting.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:34):**  Yeah.  So those crucial moments shaped history.  Yeah.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:38):**  And what happened was the Cold War.  I mean, there you know, there's some complexity to it and some other factors.  Certainly there were some important elements in politics in Mexico as well as the sort  
**[0:14:51-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:14:51):**  of folks who originally involved in the land reform, you know, moved out of power and newer  folks came into power who were more interested in, you know, closer ties with the US economy,  for example.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:04):**  But but the biggest force of change was the Cold War.  And so this was a huge influence on the way the Rockefeller leadership thought about all  their programs and all their investments.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:16):**  And so this Mexican agricultural program that had originally been directed to try to accomplish  something within the context of Mexico itself and specifically support those local efforts,  something that that might then have lessons for parts of the US that were also trying  
**[0:15:34-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:34):**  to recover from not dissimilar dynamics, honestly, of, you know, really stratified social class  and wealth dynamics.  But originally, the Mexican agricultural program, it was trying to solve a local problem.  
**[0:15:49-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:15:49):**  But in the context of the Cold War, all of a sudden, these sort of influential public  intellectuals were talking to the leadership of the Rockefeller Foundation, saying, if  we as the United States and the free world want to win the Cold War against the communists,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:06):**  we need to pay close attention to the quote unquote, third world, that is the countries  that haven't yet aligned themselves with the free world, or the communists.  And these are countries that struggle with poverty.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:22):**  And these are countries that struggle with food insecurity.  And so there was this belief in the United States and much of Europe that the need was  for food aid programs and also exportable technologies to ensure that these countries  
**[0:16:37-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:37):**  in the quote unquote, third world didn't become so food insecure, that their hunger left them  vulnerable to communism.  That was a really influential political theory in the 1950s.  
**[0:16:51-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:16:51):**  And because this political theory was so influential, all of a sudden, the decision.  Exactly.  Rockefeller was like, Oh, we need to turn our program into we need to create a model  
**[0:17:02-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:02):**  for how small farmers all over the world are all of a sudden going to produce these high  yields so that we can win the Cold War.  So forget about what we're trying to do locally in Mexico.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:13):**  That's not as important now.  One of the most diverse regions, rowing techniques that go back centuries.  And you see the effects, it just completely wiped out the small departments, they couldn't  
**[0:17:23-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:23):**  afford it as soon as they were under any kind of depth bandwagon, high yield.  I mean, you cannot get off anymore.  I mean, we now know how difficult that is.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:32):**  You get addicted literally, or get wiped out.  And we've seen that happen time and time again.  It's very interesting that yeah, an outside force in this case, global politics, and we  
**[0:17:42-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:42):**  might live in a time where that happens again, is shaping a very well intended program, but  of course, run by intellectuals very far away.  And then it just morphs into a completely opposite beast, basically, which is fascinating  
**[0:17:56-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:17:56):**  to look at, but also quite scary.  Yeah.  And something that was, you know, at the beginning, much more contextual and nuanced and informed  
**[0:18:04-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:04):**  by people within Rockefeller, who'd actually spent significant time in Mexico and were  working on, you know, more of a collaborative basis, it got replaced by something that was  not contextual, that was this sort of abstract idea that turned out to have a lot of holes  
**[0:18:20-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:20):**  in it.  But that, you know, the whole sort of public intellectual class and funder class at that  time in the 50s just got caught up in this model of the world that was much more abstract  
**[0:18:34-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:34):**  and that was, you know, proposing this sort of global principle rather than the sort of  nuanced contextual understandings of how to support agriculture in particular places.  We run that same risk now as we are intellectual, like intellectualizing the region act, the  
**[0:18:51-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:18:51):**  farmer should do this, the farmer should do that from a comfortable office far away, let's  say rural-urban divide.  And of course, the Rockefellers actually announced a huge program on food, a food program in  
**[0:19:04-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:04):**  the US, I think 105 million or something.  And a lot of other things like is that, again, we would like the agriculture space to do  something or the farmers to do something, but we mostly talk from a distance without  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:18):**  understanding the local context.  Do you see that as we are observing?  Of course, it's easy.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:23):**  We're talking with our headphones on observing the space, but what do you see there?  Yeah, I think there's a couple reverberations forward to our time.  One, I think for me is the conversation about creating carbon markets, specifically in agriculture,  
**[0:19:40-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:19:40):**  which I think is envisioned as this kind of elegant and efficient global solution to creating  an incentive within agriculture for farmers to use practices that sequester carbon.  And I think this, you know, sort of like some of the ideas that started to get sway within  
**[0:20:00-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:00):**  Rockefeller almost 75 years ago now, is not as local and nuanced and contextual as I think  regeneration requires of us.  I think the project of regeneration is actually very complex and very place-based and also  
**[0:20:20-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:20):**  has a sort of social history.  And so I think it's really important not to just imagine that the financial sector can  solve this problem simply by generating a market for soil carbon credits.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:33):**  And just some kind of simple examples of where I see potential problems here.  It's difficult to generate the sort of measurement approaches or metrics at the molecular level.  The science around measuring the movement of carbon through soil is still emerging.  
**[0:20:49-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:20:49):**  It's really interesting.  I think it's really important that we invest in it and learn more about how this works.  And I think it's pretty dangerous to pin all of our hopes for regeneration on trying to  
**[0:21:00-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:00):**  measure something that we're still learning how to see at the molecular level.  Whereas I think we have much more developed approaches for seeing functioning whole healthy  ecosystems when we look at plants and animals and sort of ecological restoration.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:18):**  So I think we shouldn't give up on some of these indicators that seem older and sort  of less sexy.  But I think also a deeper issue with some of these molecular metrics is that the equipment  
**[0:21:30-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:30):**  used is expensive.  And in some cases, the sort of systems for tabulating and reporting can be expensive  or require staff or things like that.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:42):**  And so it can become a mechanism, not unlike the Green Revolution, for shutting out the  very smallholder farmers who are essential to a project of regeneration if we understand  it holistically.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:21:57):**  So I think we should be careful around soil carbon credits.  And then I think the other lesson from this Green Revolution story that's really relevant  today is just the importance of being attentive to power and not imagining that just coming  
**[0:22:12-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:22:12):**  up with a really efficient technical approach is naturally going to accomplish regeneration  if we don't think about how our intervention is shifting power and also how power dynamics  are a part of the problem that we have in agriculture and that our solutions around  
**[0:22:31-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:22:31):**  regeneration also need to address power imbalances.  And one thing that comes up immediately, obviously, on power imbalances is access to land.  You've written about that a lot in the book, in almost all the chapters, I think.  
**[0:22:48-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:22:48):**  And let's unpack that.  I mean, it's way more for not just for one podcast, but the land ownership and access  to land, how much of that is really holding us back and why we're not talking about it  
**[0:23:02-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:02):**  more?  It seems like that elephant in the room that, or the bison or whatever, let's use a regenerative  or the whale, but that really doesn't get talked about a lot.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:13):**  And there's an enormous wealth transfer happening now where farmers are retiring, et cetera.  But if you look at just simply diversity in land ownership in the US, I think that's the  place with the best data and the worst data at the same time, the best accurate data.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:29):**  And it's really shocking to look at that.  You sum it up in the book as well.  The diversity is zero basically, or very, it's a running error.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:38):**  And why is that so much easier to talk about no-till or plowing and agroforestry than it  is to talk about who owns and why does somebody actually own a piece of land?  And have you any idea about why is it so difficult to talk about that?  
**[0:23:55-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:23:55):**  Yes.  So white people, myself included, in general are fairly uncomfortable talking about race  and facing up to in this country, the history of slavery and the legacy that that has left  
**[0:24:12-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:12):**  and continued violence and discrimination against black people.  And I think also very uncomfortable to talk about genocide of indigenous people, theft  of indigenous land, and being a settler colonist.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:26):**  That's an incredibly uncomfortable conversation.  And I think a lot of white people in the United States haven't really known what to do about  it.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:37):**  I think have felt a lot of shame, are uncomfortable talking about it, and have no idea what to  do to begin addressing these challenges.  And so it's kind of easier to just ignore them and not talk about them because they  
**[0:24:49-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:24:49):**  seem, I think, to a lot of white people, intractable.  That said, I do think that the Black Lives Matter movement, the movement for black lives  and the way in which that really reached the public consciousness in 2020 in the wake of  
**[0:25:04-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:04):**  George Floyd's murder, I think has started to move the needle on conversations about  race in the United States and I think around the world.  And I'm seeing a lot more people in regenerative agriculture and in the food and agriculture  
**[0:25:18-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:18):**  sector in general talking about it and acknowledging the history of slavery as a key piece of the  history of agriculture in the US.  Do you think enough people know about it?  
**[0:25:28-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:28):**  I read the book obviously as an outsider, or as the one that sent the columnist there.  We're never an outsider, but enough people know the details are just horrifying.  The details are the amount of land or the way in which it's been institutionalized,  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:49):**  structuralized.  It's really, really horrifying for somebody that sort of knew but didn't really know.  Do you think enough people...  
**[0:25:56-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:25:56):**  I mean, it's easy to look away, but it's also easy to look away if you don't know.  Do you know what happened?  But farming and land has been a very, very central point of the discrimination and the  
**[0:26:08-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:08):**  race movement.  It's been very, very important to take first on the indigenous side and then also a lot  of farmers of color.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:16):**  And now there are not so many.  It's been a very focal point on the rights on holding land, et cetera, and all the programs  have been designed not to help them basically.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:28):**  Do we know enough about it?  Or the answer is very simply, no, we don't know the dirty history there.  I think there's still a lot of work to do because I think your average person in the  
**[0:26:40-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:40):**  US does not know this history.  They might know that slavery happened.  Although, I mean, a third of the people in this country are willing to deny a lot of  
**[0:26:50-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:50):**  things about reality.  But these are the statistics around agricultural land in the United States and they're very  stark.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:26:59):**  About 40 percent of the US population identifies as indigenous or people of color.  And about 60 percent of the agricultural workers in the United States are people of color.  And yet only 2 percent of agricultural land in the United States is owned by people of  
**[0:27:20-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:27:20):**  color.  So that's the contemporary reverberation of the experience of indigenous land being  stolen and black people being stolen from their homelands and then forced to labor in  
**[0:27:34-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:27:34):**  this industrial food system in the US.  And then, as you said, even up against so many obstacles, black people actually did  purchase a lot of agricultural land by the early 20th century, but then were dispossessed  
**[0:27:49-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:27:49):**  of 98 percent of that through violence, lynching, people being run out of town who were land  owners by violent white mobs.  And then also this really insidious financial racism because in the wake of the Depression,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:05):**  the US Department of Agriculture created loan programs in order to kind of get the agricultural  sector back on its feet.  And these loans were essential for many, many farmers of all backgrounds to sustain their  
**[0:28:17-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:17):**  farming operations through a few periods of recession and drought and things that were  very hard on the sector.  And those loan programs were so deeply discriminatory that actually the largest class action lawsuit  
**[0:28:30-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:30):**  in US history eventually was decided in favor of black farmers who were denied loans, but  not before essentially the vast majority of the black farming population lost their land.  So two percent of agricultural land in the US owned by people of color, and it's not  
**[0:28:47-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:28:47):**  an accident.  It's the result of hundreds of years of colonization and then this sort of colonial dynamic that's  never really been taken out of the agricultural economy and the way it functions and the way  
**[0:29:02-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:02):**  it's structured.  And you said something seems to be changing or at least there's a different, I would say,  smell in the air or something is starting to shift since Black Lives Matter and maybe  
**[0:29:19-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:19):**  also since you've been starting to follow the sector 12 years ago.  I don't think land ownership was any real discussion, let's say, beyond a few very niche  circles.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:29):**  Now it seems to be slowly.  I mean, soil health is a discussion that's already a surprise.  But have you seen shifts like, let's say, four and a half years ago when we last talked,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:38):**  we didn't talk about this topic.  Have you seen shifts happening and actual and that's most important, actual land being  shifted because we can talk about a lot, but if no land changes hands, nothing really happens.  
**[0:29:51-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:29:51):**  So have you seen things change there or has it been a lot of talk until now?  I think, you know, the regeneration movement taking on board this issue of racial justice  and land justice, I think that's kind of in its infancy.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:08):**  I think there's a lot more discussion.  I think, you know, at, you know, regenerative agriculture events, virtual or in person,  you hear a lot more conversation about the need for land justice, racial justice, reckoning  
**[0:30:22-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:22):**  with structural racism.  You see a lot more speakers of color, leaders of color being centered in, you know, publications  and journalism around regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:35):**  And at these events, I think there's more of an acknowledgment that, you know, regenerative  agriculture is rooted in the ancestral traditions of communities of color.  And yet I don't have a bunch of stories of land transfer in agriculture to share with  
**[0:30:49-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:30:49):**  you, unfortunately.  You know, there's movement on the deeper land back movement in the United States.  It's not all agricultural land, but a lot of it is connected to food systems.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:03):**  There's an indigenous woman now who's been appointed in the federal government as the  head of the Department of the Interior and also an indigenous person heading up the national  parks.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:13):**  And we've recently had some high profile transfers of public lands back to native peoples.  And in many cases, those are fisheries or lands that are grazed by animals that are  perhaps hunted or, you know, something I wrote about quite a bit in the book is the buffalo  
**[0:31:29-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:29):**  restoration effort that's happening in the prairie led by indigenous people in the United  States.  But in terms of, you know, agricultural land more broadly, I think there aren't a lot of  
**[0:31:43-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:43):**  stories about land transfer yet because I think it's going to require pretty ambitious  public policy.  And you mentioned, you know, that we have this whole generation of farmers retiring.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:31:54):**  What I would love to see is a public program that buys those farmers out and then redistributes  that land, you know, cognizant of the inequity that we have now and what needs to be done  to fix it.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:09):**  And how is it for you, obviously a white woman, I mean, you cannot see it on video, but to  write this book, was it uncomfortable?  Was it weird?  
**[0:32:18-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:18):**  I'm just asking, like, you visit these bison farms and just quote unquote, it's not really  your tribe.  Like, how was that to do that and dig there?  
**[0:32:28-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:28):**  You wrote a bit about it in the book and you mentioned at the beginning of the conversation,  I'm not sure if I'm the one that had to tell the story, you did.  How was that process for you as an outsider basically to dive into that and write a book  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:44):**  like that?  And how has been the response as well?  Two questions, let's start with the first one.  
**[0:32:48-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:32:48):**  Yeah, I struggled for years with whether I should write anything like this.  You know, sort of increasingly seeing that regenerative agriculture has this really deep  history in indigenous communities and communities of color.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:03):**  Seeing that-  Yeah, let's just be clear, most or all or most of the practices have been around forever  and were just rediscovered by a white dude somewhere, put in a book and or a podcast  
**[0:33:15-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:15):**  or a series or a course or something.  And suddenly there's a great term for that, which I obviously forget.  I can imagine how annoying it is for indigenous tribes to see, okay, welcome to the show.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:28):**  You're a few centuries late.  We've been doing this forever.  And now you put a term on it.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:32):**  And it's like, anyway, so it's been around all of it or 99.9% of it.  So let's not kid ourselves.  We're standing on the shoulders of giants without knowing it or without wanting to say  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:43):**  it.  So getting that out of the way, how has that been for you?  Sorry, you struggled for years, you said.  
**[0:33:49-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:33:49):**  Yeah, I did, because, you know, I'm a narrative writer.  And so I was constantly wanting to highlight some of these stories of incredible regenerative  farmers, ranchers from indigenous communities and communities of color, seeing that oftentimes  
**[0:34:07-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:07):**  these individuals in these communities were underrepresented in the media around regenerative  agriculture.  And initially, my approach was, that's not the piece, you know, it's not for me to write,  
**[0:34:19-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:19):**  but I can, you know, how can I support people from those communities in telling their own  stories?  Which I think is the right sort of first step for white people in this space is not to think,  
**[0:34:30-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:30):**  how can I do this?  But to think, oh, you know, people are probably already doing this in their own communities,  what can I do to support?  
**[0:34:38-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:38):**  And I kind of thought that would be the way in which I thought about being an ally for  the rest of my career as a writer and researcher.  But increasingly, I saw that, you know, there was a gap specifically, kind of among white  
**[0:34:53-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:34:53):**  folks in the research community, that maybe there was a role for me to just be honest  about how I came to seeing this as so important that, you know, my background is that, you  know, my grandmother, white, lost our family farm in the Dust Bowl.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:11):**  And I started this journey just very concerned about how, you know, not taking care of soil  health, you know, ultimately destroys communities.  And you know, from that standpoint, as a white person, you know, completely embedded in this,  
**[0:35:29-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:29):**  you know, settler colonial history, I see the only hope for my community being in taking  leadership from these indigenous communities and communities of color that have this really  deep relationship with regeneration that's not just these kind of isolated individual  
**[0:35:44-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:44):**  practices, but is embedded in this whole larger philosophy and reciprocal relationship with  land.  So I eventually, you know, sort of came to the decision that I just wanted to share from  
**[0:35:57-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:35:57):**  my standpoint only, not claiming to be, you know, the expert or that this is the definitive  story about regenerative agriculture, but just to say, you know, hey, I'm Liz, you know,  I care deeply about regenerative agriculture from a personal place as well as a professional  
**[0:36:13-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:13):**  place.  And, you know, where I've come to after 12 years in this field, is that we really need  to take leadership from indigenous communities and communities of color.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:23):**  And this is where, you know, these techniques originated from.  And you know, within these communities, it's not just techniques, it is this deeper relationship  with land.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:34):**  And then it was like, okay, how can I possibly do this in a way that, you know, doesn't produce  more harm than good.  And so, you know, from the beginning, I was really committed to not profiting at all from  
**[0:36:46-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:46):**  writing this book.  We convened an advisory council of the major folks who are featured in it and made a decision  about where to allocate any of the proceeds.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:36:58):**  So those are going to a BIPOC farmers land access convergence, and then a really cool  internship with the person featured in the book who works on bison restoration for a  student from a tribal college.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:15):**  And then, you know, I have a page on my website to redirect speaking invitations.  I think really carefully about stuff like what we're doing now, podcasts.  And you know, in any case where, you know, folks are available and interested, I redirect  
**[0:37:30-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:30):**  those as well to folks in the book or people connected to them.  You know, just to make sure that I'm not getting in the way of someone else building their  platform.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:40):**  But, you know, trying to in sort of a humble way and as gracefully as possible to play  this ally role.  Because I do think ultimately, you know, everybody has to be part of this transition to a regenerative  
**[0:37:56-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:37:56):**  agriculture that's also equitable.  And so, you know, I think as white people, we shouldn't center ourselves and imagine  we have to continue to be the leaders, you know, because obviously, it's kind of an issue  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:10):**  that we set ourselves a bit too much.  Yeah, yeah.  In nature.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:14):**  Ten years ago.  No, no, it's it's okay.  Sorry.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:17):**  So we don't have to center ourselves.  It's a much broader movement.  You write about some fascinating stories in the book of not the usual suspects, not the  
**[0:38:27-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:27):**  usual ones that have been doing things that are way beyond, yeah, let's say soil health,  and which is which has been very, very interesting.  And the book came out in March.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:37):**  And we're now talking June, depending when you listen to this, obviously 2022, by the  way, how's been the response?  Yeah, I never know, people can listen to this like years from now.  
**[0:38:47-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:38:47):**  So I always have to mention what has been the response from, let's say, the traditional  region movement, the non traditional movement, the folks you featured in the book or not?  And what has been the how's this book landed, let's say in in this space?  
**[0:39:07-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:07):**  Yeah.  You know, I was actually kind of surprised that it's been, it's been really positive,  you know, maybe just to start with, you know, the quote unquote, traditional region movement,  
**[0:39:19-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:19):**  I kind of thought I would at some point get a really angry email from somebody, you know,  along the lines of, you know, I don't think racial justice has anything to do with this.  I haven't gotten that email.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:32):**  Maybe maybe people have said that in each other, you know, in each other's private conversations.  Nobody said that to my face.  Nobody sent me that email.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:41):**  It probably is because I'm white.  I imagine if I were a person of color saying this, I would get some ugly emails.  I've heard from colleagues that they have.  
**[0:39:49-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:39:49):**  I also think, you know, Black Lives Matter did a lot of work.  I started this book just a few months before George Floyd's murder, you know, not knowing  that there would be a couple years of really public conversation about race happening in  
**[0:40:06-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:06):**  advance of this book coming out.  And I think, you know, those activists really kind of paved the way for this conversation  to land and people not to be as shocked by it as they might have five years ago.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:20):**  So I actually got a lot of emails that surprised me in the other direction of folks that I'm  connected to who probably identify as rural conservatives.  That's my sense.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:31):**  I've worked with a lot of rural conservatives in the course of my work.  You know, I used to be a country singer.  I'm from Montana, who wrote me things that were very thoughtful and very empathetic and  
**[0:40:45-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:45):**  ultimately very supportive.  And I would have never, ever ventured to have a one on one conversation with some of these  people about race.  
**[0:40:53-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:40:53):**  I would have wrongly assumed that they weren't open to it.  And that's the beautiful thing about a book is you can put an idea out there and in a  way you can sort of have an indirect conversation with people and they can sort of find it and  
**[0:41:08-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:08):**  they can sit with it and they can engage you in conversation if they want to.  And by and large, I think I've been pleasantly surprised that I think there are people out  there who are ready to talk about race and land justice who maybe wouldn't think are  
**[0:41:23-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:23):**  ready.  So I'm going to have a policy going forward of never jumping to the assumption that people  aren't ready for these conversations.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:35):**  And researching this book and spending so much time on the ground, which reading the  stories must have been amazing and painful at the same time.  What has been the biggest surprise for you?  
**[0:41:47-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:41:47):**  Like where are those stories or maybe even a story that didn't make it to the book, but  like something that really, really surprised you could be on anything could be on obviously  that could be on the ground, the plans, the social side, what would have been the biggest  
**[0:42:03-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:03):**  surprise while writing this book?  And that got to you?  Yeah, I mean, I think so when I started researching the book, and when I got to the point where  
**[0:42:12-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:12):**  I was actually looking for specific people that were going to be kind of like the quote  unquote main characters of the sections, I knew I was looking to feature people of color  and communities of color, because those communities had these long standing pre colonial traditions  
**[0:42:30-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:30):**  of regenerative agriculture.  So things like, you know, bison grazing as the as the OG regenerative grazing, you know,  agroforestry within the black diaspora, poly culture, all these mixtures of crops in Mesoamerica,  
**[0:42:45-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:45):**  deep, deep, deep history, you know, think about three sisters, and nutrient cycling  practices in Asia, which actually, you know, if you sort of trace back, where did the organic  movement get its ideas?  
**[0:42:55-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:42:55):**  Like, Oh, Sir Albert Howard, and an agricultural test went to India, and came back to India.  Yeah, Franklin Hiram King, farmers of 40 centuries, he went to China, Japan and Korea.  So I was thinking about these pre colonial regenerative traditions.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:12):**  And what I think really surprised me and that I learned in the course of researching the  book, and I have to give a lot of credit to Monica White's book, Freedom Farmers for really  directing my attention in this way, is not only was regenerative agriculture important  
**[0:43:26-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:26):**  prior to colonization, but it's been important within all of these communities as a means  of resistance to colonization.  So if you think about colonization as being a kind of mode of extraction, and agriculture,  
**[0:43:41-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:41):**  collective agriculture being a part of that colonial logic, communities of color and indigenous  communities have been continually reasserting these regenerative practices to resist that  extraction, which they understand is harmful to their own bodies, their own communities,  
**[0:43:57-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:43:57):**  their own land.  And so those stories were really incredible and surprising to me of, you know, black agro  forestry in the face of enslavement and in the face of Jim Crow, this movement for buffalo  
**[0:44:11-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:11):**  restoration in the face of boarding schools and reservations, all these forms of confinement  that were affecting both people and animals, buffalo restoration being this kind of move  to reclaim this free and mobile relationship with land, which is ecologically necessary  
**[0:44:29-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:29):**  in an arid prairie, but of course, is also, you know, part and parcel of indigenous territorial  sovereignty.  So that was really exciting for me in the book when I was like, ah, you know, this is  
**[0:44:40-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:40):**  about regeneration, and it's also about liberation.  And those two projects have actually been really closely intertwined within communities  of color for the past few hundred years.  
**[0:44:51-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:44:51):**  And that might be an interesting more understatement, but interesting hook for the current, say,  agriculture system where farmers, regardless of color, are stuck, and are definitely not,  although they inherited the land or leaving the land, questing the site for a second,  
**[0:45:12-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:12):**  but are stuck in a system where they're completely powerless and need a bit of liberation and  need a lot of regeneration as well.  And it is a discussion on power.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:23):**  Like, are you dependent on outside forces or do you have your own seeds?  Are you dependent on outside fertility or do you have your own fertility?  Are you dependent on outside labor or do you have year round community on your farm or  
**[0:45:34-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:34):**  nearby that can, the hands you need to work and the hands you want to work on your farm,  et cetera, et cetera.  It is a discussion on power and liberation there.  
**[0:45:46-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:45:46):**  So that's a very interesting, like the, most of the agriculture system is stuck because  of that and not because they want to, obviously.  And what would you like investors and the finance sector, we are all far away in our  
**[0:46:01-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:01):**  shiny office, and I don't have that, but a shiny office and really not very in touch  with agriculture, at least not, let's say the real version of agriculture, what's really  happening on the land.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:12):**  What would you like to, let's imagine we're doing this in a theater on stage and the room  is full of, let's say enlightened, smart investors and people working in finance.  What would you like them to take away to do differently tomorrow or even tonight when  
**[0:46:25-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:25):**  they walk out of that theater and they talk to their neighbor and they're like, what would  you like them to, the main message to take away from your research and also the book?  Yeah.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:36):**  Well, maybe I'll start with, I think the primary concern that I hear when I talk to people  in the impact investing community who are thinking about regenerative agriculture, I  don't know where this fits on your sort of top 10 of, you know, questions from folks  
**[0:46:50-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:46:50):**  who are skeptical, but it's really high on mine.  And people say, okay, you told me about some techniques that you can verify will put carbon  into the soil, but you haven't told me whether it's going to stay there.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:06):**  How can you prove to me that it's going to-  Permanent.  Yeah.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:10):**  For a period of time relevant to the climate cycle, which is to say a long time.  And they look at, you know, the deed on a piece of farmland and they see how many times  it's changed hands in the last hundred years.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:24):**  And they say, is this money just going to evaporate because maybe we did something good  today, but somebody else is on the land in 10 years and that all is gone because, you  know, here comes the plow.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:38):**  Or the carbon destruction machine.  Yeah, exactly.  That's a great question.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:44):**  I'm glad that investors are asking that question.  I think that's a very savvy question.  And so I would say if you want to make an impactful and effective investment that also  
**[0:47:55-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:47:55):**  has a long term impact, I would say dig deeper and look at how to invest in projects that  are rooted in indigenous communities and communities of color that have really, really deep ties  to land and for whom regenerative agriculture fits within a larger social and cultural framework,  
**[0:48:17-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:17):**  rather than just as a financial activity or something where people are looking to, you  know, sort of earn a profit or a livelihood within this generation.  And I think, you know, obviously the other reason to do this is equity is looking at  
**[0:48:34-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:34):**  that, you know, U.S. statistic that 2 percent of the land is owned, agricultural land is  owned by communities of color and indigenous communities.  But it's not just about equity.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:43):**  It is really about impact and effectiveness and why wouldn't you invest in the communities  that have the longest history of having done these things successfully?  I mean, you know, talk about proof of concept.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:48:57):**  Like Buffalo Prairies did a really good job of storing carbon.  And so that's what I would say to the community of investors and funders is do have that lens  of looking at communities of color and indigenous communities.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:49:16):**  And I'll be the first to acknowledge that in many cases that requires extra homework.  You know, I mean, if folks have already been under resourced, they might not have the staff  to have a splashy web page or they might not have sort of configured their project to interface  
**[0:49:33-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:49:33):**  with the impact investing community as readily as a lot of projects that have been configured  from the beginning to generate that kind of investment.  But that's exactly what can make the investment meaningful is that you actually are moving  
**[0:49:48-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:49:48):**  capital somewhere where it's not already flowing based on prior dynamics.  You are actually shifting something and you are actually making a change that's going  to last beyond just, you know, those 10 years of the carbon in the soil.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:02):**  So additionality, the box has been ticked there.  And so what would you do if you're in charge of, let's say, a billion or even 10 billion?  I have a feeling with inflation, I need to add zeros here.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:13):**  As an investment fund, which has the longest duration you want, like you, it's not confined  to 10 years or eight years or 20 years.  It's let's say an evergreen structure.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:23):**  Where would you not where literally, but how would you put it to work?  And what would you prioritize?  And if you would be in charge of a significant, significant research portfolio, basically,  
**[0:50:34-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:34):**  or a significant portfolio full of resources.  So if you're listening to this podcast, and you're actually in that situation, I have  to say I feel for you.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:44):**  Like that's a huge responsibility.  That sounds terrifying.  And so I think, you know, the most important thing is, is you don't have to figure this  
**[0:50:53-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:50:53):**  out all yourself.  There are some incredible groups and coalitions.  I mean, the fact that we're on a podcast here is a great example.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:02):**  But sort of specifically in this space of if you're looking to invest in indigenous  communities and communities of color that have these deep histories of regenerative  agriculture, you know, I would look to groups like the Heal Food Alliance, Soul Fire Farm,  
**[0:51:17-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:17):**  the Black Farmer Fund, which I've written about a little bit in the book for some guidance,  you know, and some help kind of navigating this space, because I think it is really tricky,  especially if, if you're white, or if your group is white led, you know, sort of adjudicating  
**[0:51:33-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:33):**  claims from different projects led by different people of color, different communities of  color, it can get really uncomfortable really quickly, as you wonder, like, how do I, you  know, sort of direct traffic or referee in this situation?  
**[0:51:49-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:51:49):**  I know for myself, that often feels really inappropriate, even making decisions about  who to feature in a narrative piece.  And so you can lean on groups like Soul Fire Farm, which has a whole network or the Black  
**[0:52:02-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:02):**  Farmer Fund, Northeast Farmers of Color.  And a lot of these groups are connected to each other around the world as well.  So if you're looking to invest in Europe or the UK or somewhere else, you know, starting  
**[0:52:14-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:14):**  with any of these folks is going to connect you to sort of help you make these decisions  and figure out where where your niche is where you can make the most impact.  Yeah, because let's be clear, this is not a US problem or a North American problem only.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:29):**  This is colonization has happened everywhere, almost everywhere has deep, deep traces.  And of course, land ownership is an issue everywhere.  Access is an issue everywhere.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:40):**  And let's say diversity on the land ownership side is an issue everywhere.  And so I mean, the nuances are slightly different in some places, but that we shouldn't just  point out that, oh, that's that's the US.  
**[0:52:53-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:52:53):**  So here we're fine.  Or here wherever here is, this is something that is definitely an issue around the world  or a huge issue and a huge lever as well for change.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:03):**  Unless we start talking about the colonization of our food and agriculture and land system  and fisheries, we probably won't get very far.  And so what would you then we unfortunately we take your fund away, but you have a magic  
**[0:53:20-0:53:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:20):**  wand and listeners of the podcast know this is usually one of the final questions, but  you have a magic wand and you can change one thing in the food and egg space.  And realizing I might have asked that last time as well, but I didn't listen.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:32):**  Maybe in episode 18, we didn't have this question yet.  And if we have a ping me, because I didn't listen to it before.  But if you could change one thing, because for sure, just change over the last four and  
**[0:53:42-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:42):**  a half years that you've been extra active in the space, what would you change if you  could only change one thing in the space?  This is greedy.  
**[0:53:51-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:53:51):**  I'm going to give you two answers from everybody that always they like, yeah, one thing, but  I'm going to do things and yeah, that's not the point.  Anyway, okay, you get to  
**[0:54:00-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:00):**  from from two of my different personalities.  So you know, one side of me, I'm a poet.  I'm a former musician, I write narrative books.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:08):**  Another side of me, you know, I worked for a US senator, and I'm a policy wonk.  And I think in really precise ways about changing laws.  So, so that that side of me the wonk, the one thing I would change is I would change  
**[0:54:24-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:24):**  what happens to people's land when they retire as farmers.  And there would be a federal program that offers to buy out those farmers so that they  have a dignified retirement.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:37):**  And there is a pool of land that through public policy, you know, invested in the public interest,  can make that land available to new entry farmers, who may be indigenous who may be  farmers of color.  
**[0:54:51-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:54:51):**  Those folks would have certainly, you know, priority access to make sure that they can  get access to that land who are interested in growing healthy food for their communities  in a way that's consistent with ecological restoration.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:55:03):**  So that's what I would do on a policy basis.  The poet in me says that, you know, any policy change is ultimately based on a change in  our society's relationship to land.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:55:15):**  And so if I could wave a magic wand and change anything in agriculture, literally, you know,  all those of us on this earth would see land as a relative, as a living, breathing relative.  I think there's no better way to to end this this conversation.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:55:36):**  I want to thank you so much, Liz, to come back on the show for writing this book, for  contributing to a lot of interesting articles, and I'm going to link them below, and for  the work you do.

**[0:56:26-0:56:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:56:26):**  Thanks again and see you next time.  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:56:47-0:56:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:56:47):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:56:57-0:57:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:56:57):**  to work in regenerating soils, and have been following this space since 2011 and recording  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  
**[0:57:08-0:57:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:08):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:57:16-0:57:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:16):**  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in this space?  What should you read?  
**[0:57:20-0:57:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:20):**  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  
**[0:57:25-0:57:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:25):**  For whom is this course?  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[0:57:34-0:57:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:34):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management, consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:46):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals, or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:57:59):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:03):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:13):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:21):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes, plus PDF slides  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:31):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:58:46-0:58:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:46):**  find if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:58:57):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:59:04):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/liz-carlisle-2#t=0:59:12):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

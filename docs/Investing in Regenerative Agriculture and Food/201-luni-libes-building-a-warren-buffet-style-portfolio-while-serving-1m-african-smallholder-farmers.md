### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:00:14):**  Today we unpack the enormous opportunities of African food companies buying from smallholder  farmers and selling into the local regional markets.  The continent could easily feed itself but is a net importer of food.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:00:26):**  The opportunities are simply gigantic and the investments of today's guests show that,  growing 50 to 100% year after year.  Currently the portfolio holds 25 companies which work with 100,000 smallholder farmers.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:00:39):**  And we learn why the traditional VC model doesn't make any sense here.  And a holding company model does.  Plus why and how he wants to take the holding company public in a few years time.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:00:55):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast.  Investing as if the planet mattered.  Where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space to learn more on  
**[0:01:05-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:01:05):**  how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:16-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:01:16):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:01:28-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:01:28):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  To make it easy for fans to support our work we launched our membership community.  And so many of you have joined us as a member.

**[0:02:00-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:02:00):**  Welcome to another episode today with Luni Libes, 30 year serial entrepreneur turned  investor, author and teacher.  Welcome Luni.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:02:08):**  Oh, thanks for having me on.  And to start with the personal question, how did you end up focusing on ag and food in  on the African continent?  
**[0:02:21-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:02:21):**  For instance, not a plan, although my mentor always told me to make it a plan, but I started  a business accelerator 10 years ago called Fledge focused on mission driven for profit  companies, what we would now call impact companies.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:02:36):**  And so any impact anywhere in the world, we started investing in companies twice a year  every year.  By the time we got to 2020, we covered all but one of the SDGs like our companies when  
**[0:02:49-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:02:49):**  you look when you ask them, what mission were they solving for you would get 16 hours missing,  like an education company.  Okay, kind of part of the story as well.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:03:02):**  And the there was no majority of them, there was no majority anywhere, it was a about 104  companies after eight years of work.  And the biggest grouping of them was food and ag companies in Africa.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:03:16):**  And so that's how I wound up in food and ag is picking them seven at a time, twice a year.  And how come somehow for somebody who's not based in Africa, based in Seattle, you ended  up with such a strong emphasis or focus on those type of companies, food and ag companies  
**[0:03:39-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:03:39):**  in Africa?  I mean, did they happen to find you a lot?  Did it just a message or the method of you investing and working with the methods of  
**[0:03:48-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:03:48):**  Fletch to did it really connect there or click like, what's the reason because it could have  been education in, in in Southern Africa or Southern America or South Asia?  Yeah, it could have been clean tech, it could have been healthcare could have been, you  
**[0:04:01-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:04:01):**  know, there's 17 SDGs.  Yeah, in hindsight, it's really clear why.  So we, in the very first cohort, we had some African companies, right, despite the fact  
**[0:04:12-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:04:12):**  we're a little tiny accelerator in Seattle.  By the time we get to the fourth cohort, half the companies we invited in were from Africa,  but not all food and ag.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:04:22):**  But in hindsight, it's really clear why.  So there aren't a lot of great programs in Africa, and still aren't 10 years in.  And so we get great deal flow because we are serving that market.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:04:33):**  And then in Africa, the biggest industry by far is food and ag.  So we get a lot of applications in that space.  But really what drives it is the fact that we're picking companies as an investor.  
**[0:04:47-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:04:47):**  So Fledges investing in every company we invite into our program.  And when you're an investor, you want to pick the ones that are most likely to pay you back  most likely to make you money, right in addition to the impact.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:05:00):**  And so when you sit down and do the analysis on the business side, not the impact side,  we can we can, you know, it's hard to debate which is more important to the world, better  healthcare, better education, better food, or enough food.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:05:14):**  But when you go on the business side, and you do some analysis, and you say, Okay, well,  what's the target market?  Well, we don't we do commodity crops, we don't do cash crops, we don't do coffee and chocolate  
**[0:05:25-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:05:25):**  and other exportable crops, we just do, you know, corn and, and rice and bananas and,  and chickens and fish.  And so the total addressable market for those types of foods is everyone, everybody eats  
**[0:05:40-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:05:40):**  every day, or everyone wants to eat every day.  Most people eat more than once a day.  So the total addressable market for a food company is the population of the country where  
**[0:05:50-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:05:50):**  the company is running if it's, you know, again, commodity food that's edible in their  country.  And if you do anything else, if you go and look at education, well, then the addressable  
**[0:06:01-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:06:01):**  market is half the population in Africa, half the population is under 18.  If you look at healthcare, it's who's ever sick at the moment, which is a smaller subset.  So just on the first glance, the total addressable market is bigger for food.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:06:15):**  And we don't have to debate, you know, does people want to eat, we don't have to debate  whether or not the product fits the market need.  Of course it does.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:06:24):**  It's food, everybody eats.  And so whenever we had a choice between not every single time, but very often when we  had a choice, do we bring in this company doing edtech?  
**[0:06:34-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:06:34):**  Or do we bring in this company doing food?  On there were equal impacts, we would pick the food company.  And that happened over and over and over again for eight years until we had 25 companies  
**[0:06:47-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:06:47):**  doing food in Africa.  And only then did we notice the pattern.  And so what is the pattern in terms of because food in Africa is still very broad, you say  
**[0:06:57-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:06:57):**  commodity crops, only did you start seeing, like, okay, within this 25, five or 10, or  whatever the numbers are really successful, and they all share, like this similar DNA  or they serve similar conditions.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:07:12):**  And what was the success pattern there?  Yeah, that's a good, that's a good question.  So the very first one we brought in, in this pattern was East Africa fruits.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:07:22):**  It was a one year old company.  Quite famous now.  Yeah, back in the day now.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:07:26):**  But yeah, it was it was this is 2014.  So in 2014, it was one year old.  The founder had taken $4,000 of his own money, and earned $100,000 in revenue and broke even  
**[0:07:38-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:07:38):**  in year one.  And so just that fact, you know, how do you take almost no money and turn it into $100,000  your company in a single year?  
**[0:07:49-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:07:49):**  And you know, don't lose money.  Just seeing them in the application pool, we said, Well, we have to see what that what  that is, we have to invite that one in.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:08:00):**  And if he could do that with four grand, what we gave out $17,000 investments that year,  and now it's 20.  But what can he do with $17,000.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:08:10):**  And so we invited that first one in.  And that is a little extreme, but it's indicative of what we've seen in the rest of the companies,  which is, they all take the form of, they took a small amount of money, more than that,  
**[0:08:24-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:08:24):**  you know, 1020 3040 $50,000.  And they took it and made a company that was earning more than the than the investment.  So earning 50,000 $100,200,000 when we met them.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:08:36):**  And then with the expectation through our due diligence process that they could at least  make $1 of revenue per dollar investment.  And it's proven out more like to $2 of revenue per dollar investment in profits.  
**[0:08:51-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:08:51):**  So that's the commonality.  If you look at all the companies, you'll see a they're run by native African entrepreneurs,  we don't do expats, we did a little bit in the early days, and we don't do it anymore.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:09:01):**  That was a mistake.  There so they know the problem at hand, because they grew up with that problem.  They're capital efficient at what they do.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:09:12):**  And they had some proof before we brought them in.  No company was idea stage when we invited them into the fledge, at least not for those  companies.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:09:21):**  And they've been proving that out.  So one thing we show off from this part of the portfolio is all those companies combined  in 2016 earned cumulatively across all the companies like $1.6 million that year, which  
**[0:09:38-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:09:38):**  you know, is a nice size company, but it wasn't one company's 25 companies.  In 2001, so five years later, those same companies plus a few more that the founders, the same  founders started, they, they're parallel entrepreneurs.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:09:54):**  But that same group of companies earned almost $17 million 16.8, I think, precise.  So they grew tenfold in five years.  The reason why, right, again, the reason why I'm doubling down in this space is because  
**[0:10:10-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:10:10):**  the opportunity size for these companies, A, well, let's go, let's go two sides, one  on the impact side, there's a huge need for food in Africa, the continent grows enough  food, but they lose it by the time it gets to retailers.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:10:23):**  And so they're a net importer of food as a continent.  So we need to solve that problem.  And then on the business side, there's an opportunity to solve that problem and more,  
**[0:10:33-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:10:33):**  there's an opportunity for Africa to be an export region, feeding the global north.  And that opportunity size is not a factor of 100 bigger than these companies are now  it's a it's a factor of like, between 1000 and 10,000 in that in that order of magnitude.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:10:49):**  So these companies have already grown 10x.  And we're not looking and asking, you know, are you if they grow 10x more, is that all  they have?  
**[0:10:58-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:10:58):**  No, no, they got a growth stage in front of them.  That's 100x or 1000x before, you know, competition gets in the way.  And how do you invest in them?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:11:08):**  Like what is the structure that you chose to do this?  These sounds VC type returns, but it's not a structure you chose to put money to work.  Yeah, so we actually use two structures.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:11:22):**  The way we found these companies, again, is through the Fledge Accelerator.  And so its impact in general, all different impacts, many, many companies applied, depending  on which city in which year.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:11:35):**  Most recent for the Seattle program was 845 applicants from 85 countries applied.  And we picked seven.  And we happened to pick six of those were African.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:11:46):**  Didn't have to one was American.  And then in 2020, that was up through 2020.  And then in 2020, we changed the structure.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:11:55):**  So we changed the structure and we launched a investment holding company called Africa  eats.  And we moved all of the Fledge investments into Africa eats in exchange for share.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:12:07):**  So Fledge is an owner of Africa eats.  And then we raised some more money on top of that.  And so the new structure is answering the question of, how do you scale up their questions?  
**[0:12:19-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:12:19):**  How do you scale up these companies?  How do you actually achieve that 100x growth 1000x growth?  How do you raise capital for these, you know, their SMEs?  
**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:12:30):**  That's the general term.  They're small and medium enterprises.  They're not tech startups.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:12:36):**  How do you raise capital for them in an efficient manner?  And the third one is how do investors get back out?  And so in the VC world in the in the standard tech VC of 60 year old style of investing,  
**[0:12:50-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:12:50):**  investors get out by having the companies be acquired.  And that works somewhat in the tech space.  Works somewhat in some other spaces, but we've just never seen these kind of acquisitions  
**[0:13:02-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:13:02):**  in Africa in any market, and the biggest zero in food and ag.  So we didn't bet on that.  That's, that's, that's not a way out.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:13:10):**  Yeah, yeah, that's well, there's a lot of funds out there that are still expecting that  to happen someday.  But we're not.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:13:16):**  So I looked around, I like to find models that worked elsewhere.  And I basically asked the question, what would Warren Buffett do?  How would Warren Buffett do this?  
**[0:13:27-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:13:27):**  He's not an investor like VC style.  He doesn't just expect his companies to be acquired.  In fact, he has the opposite philosophy, which is, he buys companies is his one of his pieces  
**[0:13:39-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:13:39):**  of advice is if you like a company, buy it, and don't sell it, just own it.  It can be the whole company can be part of a company, he does both.  And so I asked the question of my crowd, like, well, what would happen if we owned a small  
**[0:13:53-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:13:53):**  piece of all these companies?  Let's just call it a quarter of all these companies.  And we own that for 100 years or 200 years or forever.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:14:02):**  Then, then what?  How would you get your money back out as investor?  That doesn't sound good for investors.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:14:09):**  But again, Warren had the answer, which is you take the investment company public, like  Berkshire Hathaway, anyone who wants to buy Berkshire Hathaway, and his portfolio can  do so.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:14:18):**  You go to the public markets, you buy some shares, you own you own a piece of that portfolio.  So we do the same thing in Africa Eats, but we just haven't gotten to the public.  We're not big enough yet to have done the public offering.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:14:30):**  We'll do that in the next few years.  So how long or what are the steps for you?  Because it's, I'm not saying easy to say, we're going to do an IPO, etc.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:14:40):**  But it's not easy to do, or at least I don't think so.  It's quite easy.  What's what are the steps for you to take this 25 or this holding company public in  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:14:50):**  the next couple of years?  What still needs to happen?  Yeah, it's really strange.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:14:54):**  It's, it's, it's not that common.  And therefore, it seems to be a risk.  But in fact, it's just a matter of scale.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:15:02):**  So we've spoken to multiple organizations that run public markets in Africa and the  London Stock Exchange.  We've spoken to multiple investment bankers who do that process.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:15:15):**  We've spoken to public equities traders who would buy this kind of stock.  We've spoken to the institutions that would invest in an IPO.  There's nothing actually holding us back except scale.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:15:26):**  Like we're just not big enough yet to merit doing that step.  And so when we're big enough when these companies are earning, you know, easy on the London  exchange when when the value of our portfolio is 100 million pounds or $100 million now,  
**[0:15:42-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:15:42):**  that's big enough to go public in London.  And there's an 127 other African companies that are already there.  And there'll be 150 probably by the time we get there.  
**[0:15:53-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:15:53):**  You just have to, you know, go through the motions of getting your accounting in order,  which we are already doing, because we know we want to be in a public company, getting  your legal side in order, which we're already doing, because we know we're going to go down  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:16:06):**  this path.  And then filing the paperwork and doing a roadshow.  And then  
**[0:16:13-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:16:13):**  Is there any risk to going public?  The only risk is that now you have a price attached to your company and the market can  bring that price down whether or not your company is doing well or not, like you suddenly  
**[0:16:25-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:16:25):**  are in the ocean and the and you don't control the tide.  But again, the companies we have in our portfolio historically have been growing 60% year over  year, the value of our portfolio is growing 60% year over year, and the markets don't  
**[0:16:41-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:16:41):**  move up and down that that much like they're volatile, not volatile.  So we do expect that this will be like Berkshire Hathaway, where when we go public, you know,  we're aiming, we're expecting when we get to London, the price per share will be six,  
**[0:16:56-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:16:56):**  seven, $8.  And that's like what it was at Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s.  And now those shares are $400,000, like just from the growth.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:17:05):**  And we're taking the rest of the Berkshire Hathaway model with us as well, which is no  dividends.  We don't extract money from these companies and hand it to the investors.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:17:13):**  We don't and it will never end at a dividend, we simply recycle any cash that ever gets  generated into more growth.  And we just expect this to keep growing for the next, again, under 200, 400 years.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:17:28):**  In terms of ag, I mean, of course, we're in a region ag and investing podcast, we talked  about the investing piece, which we're going to explore further.  But what do you see on the farm, not the farms, the ag companies, the food companies you're  
**[0:17:42-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:17:42):**  involved in, how important is the issue of soil health and how to deal with that?  If you're looking at 100, 200 years, it seems quite obvious, but is it already current for  many of the companies you're investing in and basically partly owning?  
**[0:18:00-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:18:00):**  Like 99% of all the agriculture that happens in Africa eats is organic, not certified organic,  because that costs money, but following organic practices.  And it comes out for two reasons.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:18:15):**  One because the entrepreneurs were picking that to back are ones that care.  And they care about the and I missed it, but they're all working with smallholder farmers,  we don't do any, we're not investing in the actual farming.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:18:29):**  We're investing in companies that buy from smallholder farmers and, and train them.  And so the people were picking care about the environment.  But really what it comes down to at the moment in Africa on why organic is so prevalent is  
**[0:18:45-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:18:45):**  it's cheaper.  Like I just saw Bill Gates speaking yesterday, and maybe he spoke earlier this week about  how organic is just too expensive.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:18:53):**  I don't know where this man lives.  He's like he's living on another planet.  Not that far from you, I think.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:18:59):**  I know he lives like 20 miles from here.  But his perspective...  Knock on his door, go and have a conversation about tech and soil and stuff, because I think  
**[0:19:08-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:19:08):**  there's something to maybe take him on a trip.  I would love to take him on a trip.  Because the reality is that the smallholder farmers and there's, you know, 200 million  
**[0:19:20-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:19:20):**  smallholder farms in Africa, about half the population is farmers, and more than half  the population.  They just can't afford the chemicals.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:19:29):**  Like they don't want to put on chemicals on their on their property.  Well, maybe they do, but they just can't afford them.  So part of part of why the yields are low is that they're doing organic farming.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:19:40):**  But part of it is because they only have an acre.  Like a typical smallholder farm is an acre, they can't burn up an acre with with too much  fertilizer and too many pesticides and too many herbicides.  
**[0:19:52-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:19:52):**  If they do that, they're they're done.  Like they're already poor, but that would put them totally on the, you know, on the  below subsistence farming.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:20:01):**  Like they just can't do that.  They have to treat their land well, because that's all they have.  And the companies you invest in, like are there any examples of taking that further  
**[0:20:13-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:20:13):**  from trying to get the yield up with organic inputs with with pushing in terms of seed  selection etc?  Because of course, there's a lot you can do without going to the extreme chemical and  
**[0:20:27-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:20:27):**  let's say fossil fuel based input route.  Do you do you see that happening or is that really out of your around basically?  It's it's below my level of detail that I jump into.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:20:40):**  So I don't I don't need to know as the investor, which seeds that they're choosing to plant  in Tanzania as maize.  Like I don't I don't get down to that level there because there's hundreds to pick from.  
**[0:20:53-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:20:53):**  Some of our companies are using a model where they give the inputs to the farmers.  Most of our companies using the model where they're just buying the outputs, but they  know what the inputs were and then have one company that sells seeds and only one company.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:21:07):**  So it is the current like input crisis or the price levels.  I've seen some reports of I think it was in Ghana where we're suddenly of course, the  interest in, let's say, non imported fertilizer, meaning compost, meaning skyrocketed.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:21:26):**  Do you like the current political situation and the prices that come with that?  Do that affect your companies at all?  Or because by definition, they're not using very expensive and inputs coming from outside,  
**[0:21:39-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:21:39):**  they're sort of shielded from that?  Or what do you what do you see?  We're talking November 2022 and prices are still of inputs extremely high.  
**[0:21:48-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:21:48):**  Do you do you feel that or do the companies you invest in feel that or not so much?  Absolutely, I have heard, you know, we have WhatsApp groups with all these companies.  We talk to them all the time.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:22:00):**  And yeah, we heard fertilized prices are way up.  That's a problem.  We're going to see growth this year is probably only going to be 50% instead of 60%.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:22:11):**  And I don't know what percentage of that drop is due to fertilizer and animal feed prices  going up.  That was that was a similar issue.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:22:21):**  And I don't know what percentage of that is just our companies are getting bigger.  And as you get bigger, you tend to grow slower.  Like it's really it's, you know, it's hard.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:22:30):**  If you got a million dollar your company getting from 1 million to 2 million in a single year  is a big leap getting from 1 million to 1.5 or 1.6 is an easier leap.  And so as they get bigger, they they grow slower.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:22:44):**  But we didn't see anybody get smaller because of fertilizer prices or animal feed prices.  And do you see it as an opportunity as well?  Are you entrepreneurs to replace?  
**[0:22:55-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:22:55):**  Yeah, we talked about that.  It came up, do we have enough pieces in our in our portfolio to solve the problem of animal  feeds?  
**[0:23:06-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:23:06):**  And the answer at the moment is no, we don't.  And then the other issue is that Africa is humongous.  And so even if we did have all the right pieces, and we're missing protein as one of the pieces.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:23:21):**  And just shipping it around even the East African companies in East Africa is just too  big.  It just it doesn't make economic sense.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:23:28):**  We then the price of transport would would overwhelm the savings.  Which also the price of transport exploded.  So that doesn't help either.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:23:37):**  Basically, I mean, these are looking at a lot.  Can you start a local but regional basically feed like animal feed provider, but mixing  in the different different ingredients needed, but it just didn't turn out to be feasible.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:23:53):**  Yeah, this is another interesting part of our model.  So we're not a fund.  We're not a VC fund.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:23:59):**  We're VC ask, but we're not a VC fund.  We're not 10 years.  We're not just looking for companies and then and then spinning them away, right or having  
**[0:24:08-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:24:08):**  to be acquired.  We're permanent, we're a holding company.  And so when something like this pops up, we sit down with our entrepreneurs and not just  
**[0:24:18-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:24:18):**  one at a time, but but in groups, and we try and figure out is there an opportunity here?  And if so, who in that group is going to put their hand up and take hold of that opportunity  and run with it?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:24:31):**  Or which which two or three companies are going to work together on that.  And so we have done some, some more, we have some preliminary work on joint ventures between  companies.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:24:44):**  And we were, we have one spin out that's up and running and another that's coming.  And so we're kind of excited about the kind of things that can pop out like that, without  having to find an entrepreneur who's already solving it.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:24:57):**  And without having to do this, you know, without the private equity fund style of okay, we'll  hire a team and we'll go do it ourselves.  So we can't solve every problem this way.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:25:08):**  But we're working on some opportunities.  And on average, talking about the impact, of course, average is horrible here.  But what's the difference for a typical smallholder farmer working with one of your companies?  
**[0:25:22-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:25:22):**  Like what's the selling to one of those?  Like what what is the impact for him or her with his or her one acre?  If they're selling us honey, we have five honey companies, if they sell us honey, their  
**[0:25:34-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:25:34):**  income is growing by like 50%.  Five, zero, five, zero, you know, they  of the 25 are honey companies, that's an interesting, yeah.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:25:43):**  Honey is who would have thought that?  Again, these kind of things kind of pop up, we, we found one, we liked it, we found another,  we liked it, one of them got started by one of our entrepreneurs.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:25:55):**  The reason we like honey is it's one of those things that's an extra, like, like the farmer  was farming, whatever they're farming.  And then usually what happened is the government gave him a beehive or the government subsidized  
**[0:26:08-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:26:08):**  some beehives, or in many cases, the farmer just learned about this and just bought the  beehives.  And so they got some beehives somehow.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:26:18):**  And then our company is are also aggregating the outputs, right?  So the farmer doesn't have to worry about how to sell the honey, which is nice, we take  care of that for them.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:26:27):**  And that's the general model of most of our companies is we buy the outputs for the farmer,  they get an income, they don't have to worry about anything else after that.  So we're buying the honey, their income goes up by 50%, they're still doing whatever they  
**[0:26:40-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:26:40):**  were doing before, it's just bonus income.  On the food side, when we're actually buying the main product that they're growing, we're  growing their income by at least a factor of two, sometimes factor three, biggest is  
**[0:26:53-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:26:53):**  factor five, depending on what the company is and what the crop is.  So that's typically taking people who were subsistence farmers, and giving them the median  income for that country, or a little higher than that.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:27:07):**  So you know, we don't have hard numbers on this for every farmer.  We do for about 25,000 farmers, but not for the 100,000 farmers we work with.  But in the, in the 25,000 number, yeah, we're seeing they're, they're earning, you know,  
**[0:27:23-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:27:23):**  $1,000 a year, $1,200 a year.  Whereas before they were earning a few hundred dollars a year.  Which is massive differences.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:27:33):**  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's the difference between I can definitely pay all the kids for the kids, they all have  shoes, they can go to the doctor when needed.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:27:43):**  Right there.  You know, and everybody eats every day.  Like between that and I'm not sure if my family will will have a good life for the next season.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:27:55):**  And what are you missing in terms of companies or like, of course, you're not picking them  and then finding them to build it, etc.  But what are you from now until the IPO?  
**[0:28:09-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:28:09):**  Like what what are some companies or crops or or like approaches you you would like to  add?  Is there something you're like, you're missing on that the matrix of I mean, quite honey  
**[0:28:22-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:28:22):**  heavy.  But let's say in general, is there something you would love to add if you would find it?  Yeah, the biggest thing that we see is logistics.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:28:32):**  So again, this a lot of the things we describe as Africa eats a lot of the learnings in the  two and a half years we've been doing this is is really just listening to the issues  that the companies are dealing with, you know, one at a time or in groups, and seeing patterns  
**[0:28:50-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:28:50):**  and then acting on the on solutions.  And so one of the biggest learnings I've had in it's taken a little more than two and a  half years.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:28:59):**  But you know, in doing this work, all the companies when we first found them were 100,000  dollars, again, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000 dollars in business.  None of them had a truck when we met them.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:29:17):**  The way you do business and these are logistics companies, by the way, right?  So they are literally buying food from farms, bringing it to a processing plant, and then  distributing it to retailers.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:29:29):**  That's the basic business model.  And they were doing that without owning any vehicles.  And you can do that in Africa, because there's always a guy with a truck.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:29:37):**  That's that's where the man with the van is the the aphorism.  And so that's what they were doing.  They were finding the guy with the truck, calling him up and, and moving stuff around  
**[0:29:47-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:29:47):**  and hope they show up man.  It's men with trucks.  And then they'll show up eventually and, and it really eats into your margins because because  
**[0:29:54-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:29:54):**  you got to pay them in a market.  And so very early on, even 2018 2019, just before Africa eats a lot of the fledged follow  on investments, were equity investments to buy trucks.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:30:08):**  And we just saw this transformation in these companies, they would jump up by a factor  of two or three or four or five in terms of revenues as soon as they had their own vehicle,  and their margins would go up on top of that.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:30:21):**  And so that was the clear path.  And then that East Africa fruits company, that one that was $100,000 in in 2014, it  was 5 million last year.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:30:34):**  And right now they're they have I don't know, about 80 trucks in their fleet.  Like they had to build out a logistics system.  Because there wasn't one to hire, like the guy with the trucks fine, but when you need  
**[0:30:45-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:30:45):**  five trucks, it's hard to find.  And so one of our companies in Rwanda, panel meat processing, fourth largest meat processor  in Rwanda, in the pandemic shutdown, he couldn't do his main company.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:30:59):**  So he's an entrepreneur.  He found a guy who had four extra trucks he wasn't using.  So it wasn't trucks for hire, it was trucks to lease completely.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:31:11):**  And he created a logistics company, the first refrigerated logistics company in the country  of Rwanda.  And this was just at the time that Africa Eats was starting.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:31:23):**  Got it up and running earned a teeny bit of money in in 2020.  In 2021, with no new investment, actually no no investment whatsoever into this company,  he did a half million dollars in revenue with five trucks.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:31:36):**  So Africa Eats, we invested in February this year, we invested enough to let him buy four  more, that in the profits net, we now have 13 in operation in that company.  And it's, I think it's about a million and a half so far by November this year.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:31:53):**  So it'll be a little more than a million and a half.  With a total investment, I think we put in $200,000 in February.  And those trucks get more learnings, those trucks are not just driving around Rwanda  
**[0:32:06-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:32:06):**  carrying food for a handful of companies.  They're driving all over East Africa, picking up and delivering food for hundreds of companies.  All of a sudden, we discover this opportunity exists not just for our companies, but for  
**[0:32:20-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:32:20):**  many, many, many others.  So you know, we seen this as a pattern.  The question is, is this a Rwanda thing?  
**[0:32:27-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:32:27):**  Or is this an African thing?  And it seems to be an African thing.  It seems to be that everywhere we look, the same missing piece of the infrastructure is  
**[0:32:37-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:32:37):**  there.  So we are in the process of spinning up an equivalent company in Tanzania, spinning out  of East Africa fruits.  
**[0:32:45-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:32:45):**  We know there's a need in Western Kenya, where we have two companies, we know there's a need  in Uganda, where our seed seller can't find enough guys with trucks.  And so we're building out a brand that we came up with, Africa Eats came up with called  
**[0:33:00-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:33:00):**  truck t r u k stands for Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, four major countries of East  Africa, but it sounds like truck.  And so we're building out truck across these four countries to start with, and then beyond  
**[0:33:14-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:33:14):**  that.  And it's just filling in a huge gap that we're seeing.  And that gap will then help the next wave of companies that are doing food in Africa,  
**[0:33:25-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:33:25):**  you know, get bigger, faster, because they don't have to build that out to them.  And especially, they don't have to go raise the money from the global north in order to  buy all those trucks will have not the most efficient way to do it.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:33:37):**  Yeah, it's so much more efficient to have, you know, a few really big companies, one  per country that can attract, you know, commercial capital, we don't need impact capital for  trucks, we just need commercial capital for trucks.  
**[0:33:51-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:33:51):**  And so what would you tell I mean, for sure, you talk to a lot of investors, let's say  that are potentially interested in these kind of opportunities, but are on the fence in  the global north, like, what is your main message to them?  
**[0:34:05-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:34:05):**  And what would you like people listening to this as well walk away with as obviously not  investment advice, but as a main lesson learned, or the main the main message to to remember  after our interview of about 15 minutes?  
**[0:34:18-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:34:18):**  Yeah, so I would say that probably most of your audience has never invested in Africa,  and probably has never even considered investing in Africa.  And the thought of investing in Africa just just scares that scares them to, to not act.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:34:35):**  And what I would tell you from being a startup investor in Africa for 10 years is it's just  like investing anywhere else it is, it doesn't seem to be any more risky than me here in  Seattle investing in Portland, Oregon, or, or your Dallas or Atlanta, or, you know, anywhere  
**[0:34:52-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:34:52):**  where I can't like physically just go in in an hour and go see the see the office.  Investing is investing common laws, common law, the British left lovely legal systems  all over the world.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:35:06):**  The opportunities over there are so much bigger than they are here.  And it costs way less to grab those opportunities than it does here.  So I was a techie, I was in the tech space for 20 years.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:35:21):**  I see the massive amounts of hundreds of billions of dollars being thrown into the tech space.  And it just flabbergasts me that somebody thinks there's another opportunity out there  for the next Google.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:35:33):**  Maybe there's one or two more, but there isn't thousands and yet thousands of tech startups  get started.  But there's definitely huge opportunities over in Africa and food and ag billion dollar  
**[0:35:45-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:35:45):**  opportunities and you can get in on you know, $100,000 checks and, and see 100x growth on  that, you know, or bigger checks if you have more money.  But again, the opportunities to see 1000x growth are all over the place in Africa and  
**[0:36:01-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:36:01):**  I don't see any of them in the States.  And so how do you do like the accountancy from a distance like SMEs globally, absolutely  not just in Africa are not famous for their paperwork, or keeping track of anything.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:36:20):**  You'll be surprised how extremely disorganized many SMEs are and thus very difficult to raise  raise funding.  How do you tackle that?  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:36:28):**  Yeah, it's a global problem.  That is not an African problem.  No, absolutely not.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:36:32):**  It's everywhere.  Any SMEs, I would urge you to walk in anywhere and yeah, you'll be surprised about the non  existence of Excel even in many cases.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:36:40):**  Yeah.  Well, we know this and we we plan for this and we work around this.  So I often describe I think I did a blog post on on the Africa website, I said, here's the  
**[0:36:51-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:36:51):**  recipe.  We're one part venture capital, we're one part business accelerator, and we're one part  Berkshire Hathaway, you know, in food in Ag and Africa, that middle part of business accelerator,  
**[0:37:02-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:37:02):**  right, all these companies, all these founders chose to come to a business accelerator.  That's how we found them.  They all knew they needed help.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:37:11):**  They all knew they needed.  They all knew that they didn't have all the answers, which is again, vastly different  than the world of tech.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:37:19):**  And so we've trained them in what it what it means to produce financial reports.  And I can't say that we train them perfectly.  And they all produce great reports.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:37:29):**  And that that's not true yet.  But as part of Africa eats, what we do is we check in on them constantly.  We require them to report to us on a quarterly basis what their what their financials are.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:37:43):**  We review all that we review their annual audited financials, because in most countries,  you're required to submit audited financials.  When they're out raising money, and most of them are trying to raise money, when they're  
**[0:37:57-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:37:57):**  out raising money, they're sharing with us their financial forward looking financials,  and we're reviewing those and giving our feedback on that.  And we're about to launch a service where we're going to just do the financials for  
**[0:38:11-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:38:11):**  them.  So what we've learned in in teaching them over and over and over again, what it needs  to look like, is they still don't always get it.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:38:20):**  And so we're just going to hire a small team of bookkeepers and accountants and just offer  to them that we're going to do their books for them.  And we're going to show them what it means to have a CFO.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:38:30):**  We're going to show them what it means that on Monday morning at your management meeting,  you have an actionable financial report, as opposed to your, your auditor gave you a report  from six months ago, which is generally what they're doing right now.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:38:45):**  And our expectation is once they have actionable financial reports, they'll their growth will  speed up, which is one reason a we're doing it because it's the right thing and B we're  doing it because we think their growth will speed up.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:38:57):**  And if their growth speeds up, then then our portfolio is worth more.  So we're investing, it's probably needed for for the IPO at some point.  Yeah.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:39:06):**  So you know, we're that that part of Berkshire Hathaway meets its business accelerators,  sometimes the answer is in cash.  Sometimes what they need is something beyond cash.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:39:15):**  And if we can provide that we'll provide that too.  And to, probably it's a nice bridge actually to a question I'd like to ask on a magic one.  So if you could change one thing, but really one thing only overnight could be in food  
**[0:39:31-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:39:31):**  and egg in general could be in Africa specifically could be or could also be globally, what would  that be?  Can I just put two more zeros on the end of the bank account in Africa?  
**[0:39:42-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:39:42):**  Yeah, you could but yeah, but I asked this question because I want to know what your  Yeah, what would you prioritize if if resources I'm not saying are unlimited, but are pretty  limitless in this case, a billion dollars is still a lot of money even with this inflation  
**[0:40:00-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:40:00):**  numbers.  Yeah, I'd say the only problem we're facing at AFRI, the only real problem we're facing  is lack of capital.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:40:08):**  So we could, this could be 100 company portfolio in a year if we had the capital, could be  1000 companies by the end of the end of the decade, if we had enough capital, we could  be working with 10, 10s of millions of farmers if we had enough capital.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:40:25):**  This model could solve the problem of Africa being a net import continent, if only for  the capital, like there.  That's the biggest story.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:40:34):**  I was mixing up questions of magic magic wand and a billion dollars, which you also answered  like you were just out of you like, that's the missing link here.  It's extra capital to accelerate.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:40:47):**  That's all that's all we're missing.  Yeah, of course, we'll have need a bigger team to, you know, to you to do that, but  you know, that's easy and relatively easy.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:40:59):**  And just to show we didn't talk about the land accelerator on that side of the work.  One of the fledged programs that's still running, even through the pandemic was the land accelerator  with World Resources Institute.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:41:13):**  That's a program focused on restorative agriculture, restorative forestry and agriculture, and  mostly winds up being tree based crops.  So fruits, nuts, things like gum arabic, things that grow on trees, edibles that grow on trees.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:41:32):**  And we have 1400 applications for that program this year and 1300 last year, and we have  250 ish alumni of that program in there.  They're mostly trained as well.  
**[0:41:44-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:41:44):**  Like we if only again, if only for capital, we would invest in a whole pile of those.  Like we already know that they would fit, they would fit the holding company.  And they would do the forestry ones in Africa eats, but we have a plan out for Africa trees  
**[0:42:00-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:42:00):**  that would do the forestry.  And so how do you raise money now for Africa eats as you didn't do the IPO yet?  Obviously, I mean, you need scale for that.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:42:09):**  How do you raise to get to that scale?  We've raised about seven and a half million dollars so far, all from individuals and family  offices.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:42:19):**  We have talked to many institutions, we expect some to come in and in 2023.  But to date, it's it's individuals and family offices with relatively small checks.  And you see those institutions as a key, let's say stepping stone to then be able to take  
**[0:42:36-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:42:36):**  a bunch of the land accelerator program, for instance, in or to really start scaling to  200 companies.  Yeah, or can it grow with just family offices and individuals?  
**[0:42:47-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:42:47):**  It just, it can, it will continue to, it will continue to exist and grow with family offices.  And then it'll step up and scale when the institutions come in, because the institutions  are, you know, order of magnitude, larger checks.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:43:02):**  And why are they holding back until now?  Is it the model or is it like the hold code?  They're not used to?  
**[0:43:08-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:43:08):**  Or is it just wait and see to make sure you're you're around?  Part of that, you know, some of all of that, I'd say the biggest driver is we're two and  a half years old.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:43:19):**  It's not a model they've seen before.  And they tend to like, they tend to very, very often ask, give us a three year track  record, show us three years of operations.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:43:27):**  You're almost there.  Can't show.  Yeah, I can't show three years with two and a half years of incorporation yet.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:43:33):**  But we'll get there by the middle of next year.  And then how much do you imagine you need to raise to get to an IPO at some point?  The model says about $30 million.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:43:45):**  Which is not even that.  I mean, it's a lot of money.  You get to London $30 million to get to the IPO in Africa, about 10 million more.  
**[0:43:54-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:43:54):**  We're about half way.  And I asked this question, I mean, there are many things, but if you had to pick one, for  sure you go to impact investing conferences or Africa conferences.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:44:07):**  What makes you contrarian?  What makes you really, is it your optimism for this space?  Or you're just the view of this enormous blue ocean that's in front of us that others don't  
**[0:44:18-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:44:18):**  see?  Or what's the biggest difference?  Or is it the model that you see, let's say with with any others when you go to, to a  
**[0:44:25-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:44:25):**  typical let's say impact investing conference or food and ad conference focused on Africa?  I'm still stuck on the word contrarian.  I don't see myself as a contrarian.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:44:35):**  I'm not following the path that others follow, but I don't think I'm following the opposite  path.  I think what I've done is that I just sat down and said, here's my problem.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:44:47):**  My problem is there's no exits in Africa.  So I can't raise an equity fund like, like I would if I were investing in tech in the  States.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:44:56):**  So I need another solution.  And I found another solution.  And so it doesn't look like the other people's because I don't think they sat down and said  
**[0:45:04-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:45:04):**  that.  I think most of the other fund managers said, well, there's, there's opportunities in Africa.  My choice is debt or equity fund.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:45:14):**  I'll pick one of the two of the ones that picked equity just picked equity and gave  no thought to the fact that there's no exits and their, their investors are going to be  asking them in 10, 15 years, are we ever going to get out?  
**[0:45:27-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:45:27):**  So I don't think I'm a contrarian as much as just, I'm just worrying about the next  step.  The, the, the I'm worrying about it from the perspective of the investors, not just from  
**[0:45:36-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:45:36):**  these perspective of the funding.  And some of these funds are getting to, I mean, it's not 10 years for them anymore.  It's quite a bit less.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:45:44):**  So investors should start to ask questions soonish or at least in the next few years  where the exit should be coming.  Yeah.  
**[0:45:53-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:45:53):**  And this is why in Africa, most of the, most of the institutions are debt because maybe  they did ask the question and the answer was, well, we can't do equity, so we'll just do  debt.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:46:02):**  But then you don't get the right return for the risk.  You did use revenue based financing in Fletch at the beginning, if I remember correctly,  right?  
**[0:46:12-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:46:12):**  Fletch uses revenue based financing.  But when we moved the investments over to Africa eats, we undid that and said, no, we  like these shares.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:46:21):**  We want them forever.  So revenue based is another answer.  But the challenge that comes on the revenue side, revenue based investing side is how  
**[0:46:31-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:46:31):**  do you keep funding these companies over and over again when there's no other institutions  that are, that are following you?  And so in the Africa eat style, we are the institution that's following ourselves.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:46:43):**  So we just do that by buying more and more equity.  Fletch gets 6% for its cash and its help.  And Africa eats is aiming for 25% for these companies.  
**[0:46:53-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:46:53):**  And we do that with cash.  We just buy shares and we pay more and more every time we buy shares because the companies  get bigger.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:47:00):**  So that's kind of VC ask.  And so we don't want them to buy the shares back from us.  We want them to just take the money and keep getting bigger.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:47:09):**  Keep growing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:47:12):**  So we're getting at, sorry, go ahead.  Yeah, I say that the opportunities are so big that you don't, you know, in the case  of Fletch again, it was global.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:47:21):**  And so it was trying to cover all these things.  But in the case of food and ag in Africa, why would you take money out of a company  when there's 1000x growth in front of it?  
**[0:47:31-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:47:31):**  That's just going to slow down its path to get there.  We want to put more money into it to go and solve that problem now.  And so and what do you see?  
**[0:47:39-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:47:39):**  I mean, I know you're not a farmer nor a soil expert, but like the opportunity for regenerative  practices in Africa, you say most of it is by definition.  But of course, there is a lot of chemical fertilizer, either counterfeit or real for  
**[0:47:54-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:47:54):**  very high prices that is being used by different programs, subsidized by different programs,  and being pushed by by certain people as the solution.  We mentioned Mr. Gates before, like we need to get African farmers on high energy and  
**[0:48:11-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:48:11):**  also high cost inputs, because that's the only way to grow.  What do you see as and this is might be a rabbit hole and I want to be conscious of  your time.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:48:19):**  But let's let's see if we can run it up.  What do you see as the regenerative practices and going forward next 10, 20, 15?  Yeah, I said Africa is mostly organic.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:48:27):**  On the restorative side, I see those answers in the land accelerator.  We again, we had I've seen thousands of applicants and hundreds of companies I've mentored.  Yeah, some of there's some breakthrough ideas that are sitting there in the continent, you  
**[0:48:44-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:48:44):**  know, making making organic fertilizer in 24 hours from from ag waste.  But they're just not funded yet, or they're barely funded.  And so on that side, my nonprofit runs the Terra Fund, or operates the Terra Fund with  
**[0:49:02-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:49:02):**  World Resources Institute.  It's a $3 million revolving loan fund, provided solely through philanthropy, which is why  it's sitting in my nonprofit.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:49:12):**  And so we've done loans to 20 companies in the restorative ag space.  But I think it'll just one that's doing fertilizer.  Most again, are either fruits or or nuts or Moringa or, or gum Arabic.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:49:31):**  But we have a whole bunch of other companies that hopefully we'll be able to fund with  the next tranche of capital in that fund.  Again, hopefully through Africa eats as it gets bigger.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:49:39):**  And we would love to see an organic fertilizer all over the place at a cheaper price than  than mind fertilizer.  And I think the technology is there to do it.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:49:49):**  It's just not at scale yet.  Thank you so much.  I want to thank you for your time, be conscious of it and definitely link everything below  
**[0:49:58-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:49:58):**  honestly on obviously on your work, but also keep checking in as the two worlds collide  of the land accelerator and Africa or Africa eats and obviously follow you over time towards  the IPO.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:50:12):**  Because it will be quite a quite a story and hopefully as successful on the monetary side  but also let's say more successful the impact side compared to to Warren Buffett.  But an example.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:50:23):**  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Well, thanks for letting me share and thanks for having me on.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:50:28):**  And maybe even can get your nearby neighbor to convince that organic is not necessarily  too more expensive.  Perhaps someday someday.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:50:42):**  Thank you so much for listening all the way to the end.  For the show notes and links we discussed in this episode, check out our website investing  in regenerativeagriculture.com forward slash posts.

**[0:51:12-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:51:12):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:51:24):**  Why are we doing this course?  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:51:35-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:51:35):**  these podcasts since 2016.  We thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:51:42-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:51:42):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:51:50-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:51:50):**  And what questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  
**[0:51:53-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:51:53):**  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  
**[0:51:59-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:51:59):**  For whom is this course?  You the soil builders and investors in the space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  
**[0:52:09-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:52:09):**  platform builders, act tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  designers, holistic management consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:52:21-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:52:21):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  et cetera.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:52:32):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:52:37):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:52:46):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you.  And if you have the means to consider paying what you think it's worth, thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:52:56-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:52:56):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:53:10-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:53:10):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:53:22):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:53:35):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:53:41):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:53:51-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/luni-libes#t=0:53:51):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on  the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

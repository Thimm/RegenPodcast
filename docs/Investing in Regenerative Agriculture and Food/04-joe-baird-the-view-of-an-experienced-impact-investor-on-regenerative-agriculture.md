**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:14):**  This episode I talk to Joe Beard who is an impact investor both in Italy and in California.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:19):**  We have discussed many subjects from Farm to Fork, the Chef Celebrity Movement and  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:24):**  his central theme in his work which is farmer's health.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:27):**  How do we keep these families on the land who are producing our sustainable food or  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:32):**  how do we bring them back on the land?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:34):**  So when you look at farmer's health it's about mental health, physical health and of  
**[0:00:38-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:38):**  course financial health.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:40):**  And after the farmer is healthy the soil will be healthy as well.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:45):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:46):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:50):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:51):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:56):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:01):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:05):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:08):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:12-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:12):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:14):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:19):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:24):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:28-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:28):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:31):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:34):**  Share more interviews, there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative  
**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:38):**  food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:40):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:44):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:49):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means I invite you to  
**[0:01:54-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:54):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:01):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:04):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:05):**  We're here today with Joe Bird, Impact Investing, who I met in Belio, northern Italy, where  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:10):**  he's introducing regenerative agriculture methods to restore the countryside both ecologically  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:16):**  and socially.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:17):**  He splits his time between California, where he's working both rurally and in urban areas  
**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:23):**  and trying to connect those two, and northern Italy.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:26):**  Joe, very warm welcome.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:27):**  Great, thank you Koen.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:29):**  Great to be here.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:30):**  I would like to kick off with a first question on why are you doing this what you're doing  
**[0:02:37-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:37):**  because you could do many other things with your time and you decided to focus on regenerative  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:44):**  agriculture.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:45):**  Yeah, I maybe have a not such a unique perspective but a perspective that I grew up in a rural  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:55):**  area.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:56):**  I come from a farming family but like many people, in fact most people, I migrated to  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:01):**  an urban area.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:02):**  It happened to be Southern California and in an area that really was it continues to  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:08):**  experience hyper growth.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:10):**  I saw the urban area grow and I saw the rural areas really struggle and people struggle  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:17):**  to stay on the land.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:18):**  At the same time, this awareness of the problem of the industrial food complex and I thought  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:24):**  that there was something that was missing here in terms of really what was happening  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:28):**  in the urban awareness but then really a lack of awareness of the challenges of people actually  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:34):**  trying to do this.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:36):**  Ironically, I saw the same thing in Italy, maybe even on a bigger scale where Milan was  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:43):**  thriving but these rural areas were really struggling.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:46):**  I thought that there was really, if I really was going to do something to help both the  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:51):**  planet as well as society, that this was an important problem that needed to be solved.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:57):**  The theory of buying organic and whole foods but then the reality of people trying to produce  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:02):**  and stay on that land was a problem I felt really needed to be worked on.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:09):**  Thank you.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:10):**  Why Northern Italy?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:13):**  Family.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:16):**  My family has been there, near as we can tell, about a thousand years.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:23):**  My grandfather came to the United States in the early 1920s but really he was one of seven.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:32):**  I stayed there and so we have a lot of connections to that area that we've nurtured over the  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:39):**  years and it is home.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:41):**  It feels as much or more home than here in California.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:46):**  If you look at that area specifically, the villages north of Milan, northwest of Milan  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:52):**  actually, there you're trying to work and trying to bring people back to the land and  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:57):**  keep them on the land in a sustainable way, right?  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:01):**  We are.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:02):**  This was the positive in a world of global warming and drought.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:10):**  This is an area that gets a lot of rain.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:14):**  Historically there has been good sun exposure, the soil is decent, a lot of rain.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:21):**  This was historically a fairly positive agricultural area but because of urbanization, because  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:29):**  of industrialization, people have largely abandoned many of these areas, especially  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:35):**  the terrace lands.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:38):**  We're really working to re-energize both from a community as well as regenerate these lands  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:45):**  that have been largely abandoned.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:49):**  By doing that you're trying to reconnect them to the bigger cities.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:54):**  Is Milan a target or they're closer once you're looking at to make that rural-urban connection  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:00):**  again?  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:01):**  Yeah, I do believe.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:02):**  Certainly Milan is an hour and 15 minutes by train.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:06):**  We are 30 minutes from Switzerland.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:11):**  I think while there's a regional importance to connect to the local and regional markets,  
**[0:06:16-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:16):**  being part of a large urban market is important, certainly from a business model standpoint.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:25):**  Then switching completely to the other side of the world, what are you spending your time  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:30):**  on in California?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:33):**  Probably two things.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:38):**  I have connections in both far north California, which is a very rural, people think about  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:43):**  the redwoods, but it's really the temperate rainforest and the agriculture sheds up in  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:48):**  that area that I'm still very connected to, both from a family and friend standpoint.  
**[0:06:53-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:53):**  Working with those farmers and value-added producers to find new markets in more urbanized  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:01):**  areas.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:02):**  Then here in southern California, the challenge is a bit different in terms of just mass urbanization,  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:08):**  or the loss of farmland, the drought, how do we find viable farming models in this periphery  
**[0:07:15-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:15):**  that really stops or slows down this, where we're just losing farmland?  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:22):**  Really most of the agricultural production is either in the Central Valley or quite a  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:26):**  ways away.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:28):**  Working both at the not-for-profit level here in our community, as well as with young farmers  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:34):**  and value-added producers, is they really try to find a business model to be viable  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:39):**  in this urban area.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:42):**  Have you found them already?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:43):**  Are there early signs of business models that are stopping this mass urban growth and actually  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:51):**  are able to deliver products relatively nearby and sustainable, both environmentally and  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:57):**  socially?  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:58):**  Or are we too early for that?  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:08:00):**  I think there's signs of hope, signs of challenge, I would say.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:08:07):**  Certainly in the value-added producers and in the brand building, there's such an awareness  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:08:13):**  of farm-to-table, chef culture, etc.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:08:16):**  There's a good push there, but then really the difficulty of buying and managing and  
**[0:08:23-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:08:23):**  developing what I'll call middle scale in terms of 80 to 200 acres, those are tough  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:08:32):**  models in terms of how we find scaling for that.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:08:36):**  I think that we're in the early days of that.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:08:39):**  There have been some steps forward that brave farmers and others have taken, but we're in  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:08:46):**  the early stages of really viability of those models, much more so in Southern California  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:08:50):**  than Northern California.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:08:52):**  Southern California in the Bay Area, they are probably 20 to 25 years ahead of Southern  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:00):**  California in some respects, certainly in terms of this local agricultural support movement.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:06):**  So you're really saying that you've seen a lot of pioneers maybe on a small scale and  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:11):**  of course the huge industrial farms, but what's missing at least in Southern California is  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:18):**  the middle size, which usually comprises most of the market, but in this case it's not  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:23):**  there yet.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:24):**  How do you grow that?  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:25):**  Yeah, I think that's the thing is just what are the models to make, how can a person,  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:30):**  a family be viable?  
**[0:09:33-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:33):**  A backyard or small scale, an acre vegetable gardener, that's probably going to be a supplemental  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:40):**  income, hopefully, not a family income.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:43):**  Another cost.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:44):**  Exactly, especially in the urban area or even close to the urban area.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:49):**  So it's that how do you reach something of an adequate scale to be able to provide for  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:55):**  a family?  
**[0:09:56-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:56):**  Yeah, so that's if I look at your drive, but also your theory of change is making sure  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:05):**  that in this whole transition and revolution in the agricultural space that we're seeing  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:09):**  now hopefully with more focus on soil, etc., that the land user and the land owner, the  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:16):**  families that are working the lands and producing the food for us are the ones that are also  
**[0:10:21-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:21):**  benefiting and able to stay or come back actually, which is I think a part that's often forgotten  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:29):**  in the whole sustainability switch in agriculture we're pushing for.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:34):**  Yeah, I totally agree.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:36):**  It's been my focus is really to start at the land and the soil.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:42):**  We can't keep that viable.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:45):**  We can't keep those farmers viable over the long term.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:51):**  We just have this focus around the chef culture and branding of products, but then really  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:57):**  our underpinning, our soil health and our farmer health really doesn't grow over time.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:03):**  And so for me, it's a false sense of security.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:08):**  And what happens is that we'll end up shifting the dependence away from smaller farmers and  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:14):**  into large scale industrial producers who happen to be organic.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:19):**  And so you might argue that it starts for you actually with the farmer's health and  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:27):**  naturally if the farmer is and the farmer's family is healthy and working there, also  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:31):**  actually the soil follows after that.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:34):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:35):**  Certainly.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:36):**  Yes, I totally agree.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:38):**  How do we find a model that a family or families can live and thrive off of these lands, which  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:47):**  is going to clearly require that we have a healthy soil and environment within that?  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:54):**  Extremely interesting.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:55):**  Extremely interesting.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:56):**  So if we look at what's keeping you busy and what has kept you busy, if we look one year  
**[0:12:03-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:12:03):**  ago, so we're now in October 2016, we look one year ago, October, so let's say fall 2015,  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:12:11):**  what has kept you busy in the last 12 months and what are you proud of that you have achieved  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:12:17):**  in the last 12 months?  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:12:21):**  Probably we've gone from theory to practice.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:12:25):**  I think that there was, if we think about the last five years, there's certainly this  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:12:34):**  permaculture and all of its various forms have become fairly well known.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:12:40):**  The farm to table movement has been in full swing.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:12:43):**  So there's been a lot of awareness within this.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:12:47):**  But over the last 12 months, I think what we've seen is people gone from trials and  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:12:52):**  experiments to actually stepping out and making those first investments.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:12:57):**  So that's been the most encouraging thing that's happened in the last year is to see  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:04):**  these various people, these various pioneers actually take the step out and find a way  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:10):**  to make the purchases and begin viable operations.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:15):**  What keeps me up at night is that viability in terms of is there a support network, is  
**[0:13:21-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:21):**  there add-on financing and patient capital that's going to allow this group of people  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:28):**  to remain viable.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:30):**  So that's really what concerns me.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:35):**  And how do they get to the 200 hectares?  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:39):**  What investors and what type of investments are necessary for that?  
**[0:13:43-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:43):**  And that actually is an interesting bridge to what if we look a year from now.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:50):**  So we're in September, October 2017.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:54):**  What will have changed?  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:55):**  What do you hope has changed in a broader scale, so in industry and the regenerative  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:59):**  agriculture industry, but also in your personal practice, of course?  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:14:05):**  Well I hope more network and community.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:14:10):**  So in terms of first of all, this cannot be, this needs to be a broad scale community effort,  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:14:17):**  people working together.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:14:19):**  And so in the old days, farmers, that was always a cooperative nature.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:14:23):**  This needs to be the same in this case.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:14:26):**  So I hope there's continued to be a lot of kind of early stage, this early stage group  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:14:32):**  that continues to find ways to work together, both whether it be kind of in a broader sense  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:14:38):**  the word, but certainly regional.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:14:41):**  So where there's new models of cooperation.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:14:45):**  So that's what my hope is, kind of at the financing or the rest of the ecosystem, I  
**[0:14:53-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:14:53):**  hope we continue to go from the hype of farm to table and this worship of the chef or the  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:00):**  value added producers to an awareness, continued awareness that we really need to focus around  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:06):**  the producer as well, the farmer and the producer.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:08):**  And so that's what I hope.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:12):**  From a personal standpoint, we want to continue to make kind of more tangible steps.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:19):**  So in terms of finding models to make additional investments in agricultural land, finding  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:25):**  continued pioneers that want to go back onto the land, how do we incubate those?  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:30):**  So just more continued tangible steps that again, as you've probably picked up on, for  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:36):**  me it's about how do we get viable farmers on the land versus the value added producers,  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:42):**  which are certainly important, but we need to continue to focus.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:47):**  Definitely.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:48):**  And the value starts at the land and without that you cannot add anything later on.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:56):**  Indeed.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:58):**  And if you look at, so that's a year from now, what kept you up from sleeping the last  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:16:05):**  months if you work on any projects, on any investments, et cetera, that are hopefully  
**[0:16:11-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:16:11):**  now closing, you can share with us, but that kept you up the last few months.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:16:22):**  The fears of young people.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:16:25):**  So in terms of what keeps me up at night is that they're, unlike perhaps people that are  
**[0:16:33-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:16:33):**  involved in technology or other earlier stage ventures, there seems to be a good support  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:16:43):**  network for those people.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:16:46):**  But in terms of the people that are maybe taking a different path, what's kept me up  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:16:52):**  probably more than anything is that worried about that those earlier stage folks are going  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:16:58):**  to fail because of a lack of support.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:03):**  And both from a kind of a regional social system as well as others to get them through  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:09):**  those difficult times.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:11):**  That's what's the, as we've talked before, it's really about the people and their personal  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:17):**  aspirations, ability to sustain, that sort of thing.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:21):**  And do we have enough of a social system around those people to get them through those dark  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:29):**  early days?  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:30):**  So that's probably what keeps me up at night more than anything.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:34):**  Yeah, because if they fail, it sends a ripple effect through the whole sector, actually,  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:39):**  especially if they're slightly high profile, apart from all the personal losses you have  
**[0:17:45-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:45):**  when you fail something and probably you won't try again, which is bad for all of us.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:52):**  How to get through the valley of death, which also exists outside Silicon Valley.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:57):**  Yeah, and much more, it's much more of a concern in Europe than here.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:04):**  In California specifically, we have a history of experiments failed and keep moving forward.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:11):**  So it's probably more acceptable here.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:13):**  But in Europe, and certainly in Italy, there is a stigma of failure that is really paralyzing.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:22):**  And that's certainly something that's really getting in the way of acceleration of these  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:28):**  experiments that really need to happen.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:31):**  And does it keep people from trying as well?  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:33):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:35):**  It keeps people stuck in analysis.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:37):**  And do because you're saying that actually, this culture of trying and failing is fine,  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:44):**  also exists outside the technology space, but also exists in a broader, and in this  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:49):**  case, agriculture space in the US, and it would be great if that would be shared more  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:55):**  because we need more trial, but it's not just technology where failure is accepted.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:59):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:00):**  I think in failure in terms of I like to think of failed experiments, that does not mean  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:07):**  a failure.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:08):**  Right.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:09):**  So trial and error.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:10):**  Exactly.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:11):**  We have no choice but to take experiments, and they can be in whatever form those take,  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:16):**  but we have to be in a mode of experimentation.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:21):**  And that's the thing that we're really I see young people, especially in Europe, especially  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:26):**  in Italy, totally paralyzed in many cases, and then not wanting to talk about it, really  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:32):**  getting jammed up instead of having an environment where we're kind of working through these  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:37):**  experiments, working through the trials, etc., to find the viable model.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:42):**  And are investors ready to work on trial and error methods?  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:49):**  I think so.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:50):**  I think as long as we like anything, we have to take a portfolio approach.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:56):**  So it's many, many experiments versus one big experiment.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:02):**  We have to, you know, how do we find a series of experiments that then we can then each  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:08):**  of those learnings, you know, I didn't use the word failure, but each of those learnings  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:14):**  needs to benefit others within the portfolio.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:17):**  And so, again, this is not an isolation.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:20):**  We've got to think about this from a portfolio standpoint.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:24):**  So there needs to be a lot of openness and sharing otherwise the learning becomes a failure  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:32):**  because it's too isolated to be a learning for anybody else.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:36):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:37):**  What a shame that is.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:38):**  I mean, in terms of this, if we just see the negative part of the failing, right, so that  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:43):**  really the personal challenge and then quietly they quietly they go back to their job and  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:50):**  wherever.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:51):**  Right.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:52):**  So it's a waste.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:53):**  It's literally a waste.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:54):**  It is a waste versus, you know, it's shared with someone else and they can either get  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:57):**  back up and try something else or someone else can can learn from that and push the  
**[0:21:01-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:01):**  ball forward.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:02):**  And how are you trying to do that in Italy, where, like you mentioned, the culture of  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:07):**  failures, it's much more culture of failures than it is a culture of learning.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:12):**  It's difficult.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:13):**  I'll be perfectly honest with you because it's there is a bit of a cultural clash and  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:20):**  that we I think it's through communication.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:26):**  And we've talked that it's about meeting, it's about learning to talk about the benefits  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:34):**  of both, that there is not one good model and specifically I think this is really where  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:39):**  the connection between specifically Italy and California or Italy and the United States  
**[0:21:45-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:45):**  that it is not one.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:47):**  There's not one model that's better than the other.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:49):**  I think the models together are really powerful.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:51):**  One of the positive things about Europe and the Italian culture is it's a long focus.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:57):**  And I think if you combine that with some of the experimentation and kind of the California  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:04):**  mentality, I think if you put those two things together, I think it really, really can help  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:10):**  drive both forward.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:12):**  Both give a better perspective to Americans in terms of the impact in long term as well  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:17):**  as from an Italian standpoint.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:21):**  That there is a great upside that we live in a world where we have to experiment.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:26):**  And I think the other thing is that not just meeting but bringing investors together, bringing  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:31):**  international, specifically American investors with European and Italian investors to work  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:37):**  together.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:38):**  So these again, these learnings can be shared both at the investor as well as the entrepreneur.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:43):**  And when you say together, do you really mean together, together, physical, not just the  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:51):**  online version but bringing them, for instance, in Northern Italy in value to really share,  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:56):**  I mean, as they in Italy do, share meals, etc. and really connect.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:00):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:01):**  Share meals, share stories, share investments.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:05):**  Yeah, people getting to know each other, building trust and then taking those steps of investing  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:10):**  together.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:11):**  That's extremely interesting.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:13):**  And you mentioned in the call we had before that you're working actually not only on the  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:18):**  cultural barriers that they are to make this happen, for instance, to invest together in  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:23):**  agricultural land in Italy and agriculture entrepreneurs and farmers, but also on the  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:29):**  practicalities, you want to just briefly mention what you're working on on that side?  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:34):**  Yeah, just in terms of the vehicles to be able to make investments together or manage  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:40):**  lands together.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:41):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:42):**  I mean, you mentioned it's both a struggle and an interesting discovery to see what is  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:47):**  possible and where there are actually possibilities to do these things, because probably it's  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:52):**  one of the first vehicles that somebody set up with this kind of focus and this kind of  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:58):**  long term focus as well.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:00):**  Yeah, and we've worked with, you know, it's a puzzle, like anything in terms of the early  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:05):**  stages are.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:07):**  But we've been spending quite a bit of time working with the attorneys, the accountants,  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:12):**  the notaries, etc. on the Italian side to understand the pieces of the puzzle to be  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:18):**  able to take these investments together.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:20):**  So specifically, you know, how do we have investment vehicles that do really two or  
**[0:24:25-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:25):**  three things?  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:26):**  One, joint investments by internationals as well as local Italians?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:31):**  Two, following a model of, you know, we believe that farmers need to grow into owners.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:39):**  How do we find a model that allows that to happen in a corporate structure?  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:44):**  And then, you know, how do we have the right lowest cost model to be able to operate this  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:49):**  over the long term towards viability?  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:52):**  And so we have been spending really quite a bit of time over the last six months with  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:57):**  people both in the US as well as in Italy in terms of what is the model.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:04):**  I think we have some very good learnings and some first investment vehicles that we'll  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:10):**  be putting in play hopefully next year.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:13):**  Great.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:14):**  So that was going to be my next question, actually.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:16):**  When can we expect something that impact investors and investors from around the world can participate  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:23):**  in what you're hoping next year, which should be a great time in 2017?  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:28):**  Yeah, I think the second half of 2017.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:32):**  You know, the first half is really sitting down across those tables with our local partners  
**[0:25:40-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:40):**  to understand.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:41):**  So we're communicating, talking about the pros and cons, the models, and then making  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:47):**  a decision in terms of those first vehicles.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:51):**  So I think the timing is certainly 2017.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:54):**  We'd love to take that step.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:56):**  Great.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:57):**  And so apart from these vehicles, if you have any advice for smart investors that want to  
**[0:26:03-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:03):**  get into the regenerative agriculture space, what would you be advising them to look at  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:10):**  to be careful for?  
**[0:26:11-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:11):**  What kind of lessons have you learned and are you, of course, still learning?  
**[0:26:17-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:17):**  Portfolio and portfolio across the value chain, I think, is going to be really important.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:24):**  So both as the farmer producer, value-added producers, those sort of things.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:30):**  That's been my approach all along.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:33):**  That's the full value chain.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:35):**  The second is beware of isolation geographically.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:42):**  And so we've seen both in the US as well as in Europe, these regenerative hubs, if you  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:54):**  will, need to be connected to urban areas.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:57):**  And so it works in tandem, trying to be in isolation, a market that's not connected to  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:06):**  an urban center is really difficult.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:09):**  And I think that there is prone to failure.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:11):**  And so that would be the other thing is just make sure that these hubs that you're looking  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:16):**  at investing in, that we've got a really strong connection to the urban center and an efficient  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:21):**  connection to the urban center.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:24):**  When you mentioned connection, do you mean the physical connection, so the distance or  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:28):**  social or both?  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:30):**  And what would be, because I think distances are different here and in Europe as they are  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:35):**  in the US, what do you feel like is too much or when it gets a danger to your portfolio?  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:41):**  Yeah, I think it is certainly social, but geographic as well.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:47):**  I think that we've got to be careful in terms of, well, let me just give you an example.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:56):**  And it may not translate exactly to the European context, but in the Northeast, there are lots  
**[0:28:04-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:04):**  of successful examples of farms up the Hudson Valley and within a couple of hours of New  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:11):**  York City.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:13):**  Those operations get very well connected to both restaurants that are sponsoring them  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:20):**  as well as farmers markets, as well as brands that are building within Manhattan.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:25):**  So those are working in tandem.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:27):**  And so in fact, especially in their early days from an investment standpoint, having  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:32):**  that tighter connection and having that relationship, defined relationship with the urban market  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:38):**  is really important.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:39):**  And we've heard this from other investors who have really been in very early and at  
**[0:28:44-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:44):**  first we're looking at very lower priced, large scale areas in remote rural areas.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:52):**  They really switched gears and really went back to this model where it's more of a hub  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:56):**  and spoke in the urban area, especially in the early days until we prove the models out.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:29:01):**  That would be another thing just to be aware of that we've seen people all over that this  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:29:06):**  connection is really important, but certainly over the next five years.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:29:10):**  Definitely.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:29:11):**  I want to thank you so much, unless there's anything else you would like to share and  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:29:16):**  I can promise we'll be checking in regularly and of course follow the different projects  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:29:21):**  you're working on and hopefully share that over the next years as well.

**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:30:37):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:30:42):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:30:46):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:30:47):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:30:51):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:30:56):**  and recording this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:31:01):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?

**[0:31:41-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:31:41):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:31:44):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:31:56-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:31:56):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:31:58):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:02):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:32:07-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:07):**  different means.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:08):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:13):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:16):**  Thank you.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:17):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:18):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:24):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:26):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:32:31-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:31):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:37):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:41):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:43):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:48):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:52):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:56):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:32:57-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:57):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:59):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:33:02):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:33:05):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:33:08):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:33:13):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or whatever you're drinking.

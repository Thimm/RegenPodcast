**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:14):**  This episode I talk to Joe Beard who is an impact investor both in Italy and in California.  We have discussed many subjects from Farm to Fork, the Chef Celebrity Movement and  his central theme in his work which is farmer's health.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:27):**  How do we keep these families on the land who are producing our sustainable food or  how do we bring them back on the land?  So when you look at farmer's health it's about mental health, physical health and of  
**[0:00:38-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:38):**  course financial health.  And after the farmer is healthy the soil will be healthy as well.  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:46):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  Investing as if the planet mattered.  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:00:56):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:08):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:19):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:31):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further.  Share more interviews, there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative  food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:40):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means I invite you to  
**[0:01:54-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:01:54):**  support me and make this happen.  For more information please find a link to my Patreon account in the description below.  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:04):**  Enjoy!  We're here today with Joe Bird, Impact Investing, who I met in Belio, northern Italy, where  he's introducing regenerative agriculture methods to restore the countryside both ecologically  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:16):**  and socially.  He splits his time between California, where he's working both rurally and in urban areas  and trying to connect those two, and northern Italy.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:26):**  Joe, very warm welcome.  Great, thank you Koen.  Great to be here.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:30):**  I would like to kick off with a first question on why are you doing this what you're doing  because you could do many other things with your time and you decided to focus on regenerative  agriculture.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:02:45):**  Yeah, I maybe have a not such a unique perspective but a perspective that I grew up in a rural  area.  I come from a farming family but like many people, in fact most people, I migrated to  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:01):**  an urban area.  It happened to be Southern California and in an area that really was it continues to  experience hyper growth.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:10):**  I saw the urban area grow and I saw the rural areas really struggle and people struggle  to stay on the land.  At the same time, this awareness of the problem of the industrial food complex and I thought  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:24):**  that there was something that was missing here in terms of really what was happening  in the urban awareness but then really a lack of awareness of the challenges of people actually  trying to do this.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:36):**  Ironically, I saw the same thing in Italy, maybe even on a bigger scale where Milan was  thriving but these rural areas were really struggling.  I thought that there was really, if I really was going to do something to help both the  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:03:51):**  planet as well as society, that this was an important problem that needed to be solved.  The theory of buying organic and whole foods but then the reality of people trying to produce  and stay on that land was a problem I felt really needed to be worked on.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:09):**  Thank you.  Why Northern Italy?  Family.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:16):**  My family has been there, near as we can tell, about a thousand years.  My grandfather came to the United States in the early 1920s but really he was one of seven.  I stayed there and so we have a lot of connections to that area that we've nurtured over the  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:39):**  years and it is home.  It feels as much or more home than here in California.  If you look at that area specifically, the villages north of Milan, northwest of Milan  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:04:52):**  actually, there you're trying to work and trying to bring people back to the land and  keep them on the land in a sustainable way, right?  We are.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:02):**  This was the positive in a world of global warming and drought.  This is an area that gets a lot of rain.  Historically there has been good sun exposure, the soil is decent, a lot of rain.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:21):**  This was historically a fairly positive agricultural area but because of urbanization, because  of industrialization, people have largely abandoned many of these areas, especially  the terrace lands.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:38):**  We're really working to re-energize both from a community as well as regenerate these lands  that have been largely abandoned.  By doing that you're trying to reconnect them to the bigger cities.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:05:54):**  Is Milan a target or they're closer once you're looking at to make that rural-urban connection  again?  Yeah, I do believe.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:02):**  Certainly Milan is an hour and 15 minutes by train.  We are 30 minutes from Switzerland.  I think while there's a regional importance to connect to the local and regional markets,  
**[0:06:16-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:16):**  being part of a large urban market is important, certainly from a business model standpoint.  Then switching completely to the other side of the world, what are you spending your time  on in California?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:33):**  Probably two things.  I have connections in both far north California, which is a very rural, people think about  the redwoods, but it's really the temperate rainforest and the agriculture sheds up in  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:06:48):**  that area that I'm still very connected to, both from a family and friend standpoint.  Working with those farmers and value-added producers to find new markets in more urbanized  areas.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:02):**  Then here in southern California, the challenge is a bit different in terms of just mass urbanization,  or the loss of farmland, the drought, how do we find viable farming models in this periphery  that really stops or slows down this, where we're just losing farmland?  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:22):**  Really most of the agricultural production is either in the Central Valley or quite a  ways away.  Working both at the not-for-profit level here in our community, as well as with young farmers  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:34):**  and value-added producers, is they really try to find a business model to be viable  in this urban area.  Have you found them already?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:43):**  Are there early signs of business models that are stopping this mass urban growth and actually  are able to deliver products relatively nearby and sustainable, both environmentally and  socially?  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:07:58):**  Or are we too early for that?  I think there's signs of hope, signs of challenge, I would say.  Certainly in the value-added producers and in the brand building, there's such an awareness  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:08:13):**  of farm-to-table, chef culture, etc.  There's a good push there, but then really the difficulty of buying and managing and  developing what I'll call middle scale in terms of 80 to 200 acres, those are tough  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:08:32):**  models in terms of how we find scaling for that.  I think that we're in the early days of that.  There have been some steps forward that brave farmers and others have taken, but we're in  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:08:46):**  the early stages of really viability of those models, much more so in Southern California  than Northern California.  Southern California in the Bay Area, they are probably 20 to 25 years ahead of Southern  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:00):**  California in some respects, certainly in terms of this local agricultural support movement.  So you're really saying that you've seen a lot of pioneers maybe on a small scale and  of course the huge industrial farms, but what's missing at least in Southern California is  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:18):**  the middle size, which usually comprises most of the market, but in this case it's not  there yet.  How do you grow that?  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:25):**  Yeah, I think that's the thing is just what are the models to make, how can a person,  a family be viable?  A backyard or small scale, an acre vegetable gardener, that's probably going to be a supplemental  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:40):**  income, hopefully, not a family income.  Another cost.  Exactly, especially in the urban area or even close to the urban area.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:09:49):**  So it's that how do you reach something of an adequate scale to be able to provide for  a family?  Yeah, so that's if I look at your drive, but also your theory of change is making sure  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:05):**  that in this whole transition and revolution in the agricultural space that we're seeing  now hopefully with more focus on soil, etc., that the land user and the land owner, the  families that are working the lands and producing the food for us are the ones that are also  
**[0:10:21-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:21):**  benefiting and able to stay or come back actually, which is I think a part that's often forgotten  in the whole sustainability switch in agriculture we're pushing for.  Yeah, I totally agree.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:36):**  It's been my focus is really to start at the land and the soil.  We can't keep that viable.  We can't keep those farmers viable over the long term.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:10:51):**  We just have this focus around the chef culture and branding of products, but then really  our underpinning, our soil health and our farmer health really doesn't grow over time.  And so for me, it's a false sense of security.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:08):**  And what happens is that we'll end up shifting the dependence away from smaller farmers and  into large scale industrial producers who happen to be organic.  And so you might argue that it starts for you actually with the farmer's health and  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:27):**  naturally if the farmer is and the farmer's family is healthy and working there, also  actually the soil follows after that.  Absolutely.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:35):**  Certainly.  Yes, I totally agree.  How do we find a model that a family or families can live and thrive off of these lands, which  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:47):**  is going to clearly require that we have a healthy soil and environment within that?  Extremely interesting.  Extremely interesting.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:11:56):**  So if we look at what's keeping you busy and what has kept you busy, if we look one year  ago, so we're now in October 2016, we look one year ago, October, so let's say fall 2015,  what has kept you busy in the last 12 months and what are you proud of that you have achieved  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:12:17):**  in the last 12 months?  Probably we've gone from theory to practice.  I think that there was, if we think about the last five years, there's certainly this  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:12:34):**  permaculture and all of its various forms have become fairly well known.  The farm to table movement has been in full swing.  So there's been a lot of awareness within this.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:12:47):**  But over the last 12 months, I think what we've seen is people gone from trials and  experiments to actually stepping out and making those first investments.  So that's been the most encouraging thing that's happened in the last year is to see  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:04):**  these various people, these various pioneers actually take the step out and find a way  to make the purchases and begin viable operations.  What keeps me up at night is that viability in terms of is there a support network, is  
**[0:13:21-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:21):**  there add-on financing and patient capital that's going to allow this group of people  to remain viable.  So that's really what concerns me.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:35):**  And how do they get to the 200 hectares?  What investors and what type of investments are necessary for that?  And that actually is an interesting bridge to what if we look a year from now.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:50):**  So we're in September, October 2017.  What will have changed?  What do you hope has changed in a broader scale, so in industry and the regenerative  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:13:59):**  agriculture industry, but also in your personal practice, of course?  Well I hope more network and community.  So in terms of first of all, this cannot be, this needs to be a broad scale community effort,  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:14:17):**  people working together.  And so in the old days, farmers, that was always a cooperative nature.  This needs to be the same in this case.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:14:26):**  So I hope there's continued to be a lot of kind of early stage, this early stage group  that continues to find ways to work together, both whether it be kind of in a broader sense  the word, but certainly regional.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:14:41):**  So where there's new models of cooperation.  So that's what my hope is, kind of at the financing or the rest of the ecosystem, I  hope we continue to go from the hype of farm to table and this worship of the chef or the  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:00):**  value added producers to an awareness, continued awareness that we really need to focus around  the producer as well, the farmer and the producer.  And so that's what I hope.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:12):**  From a personal standpoint, we want to continue to make kind of more tangible steps.  So in terms of finding models to make additional investments in agricultural land, finding  continued pioneers that want to go back onto the land, how do we incubate those?  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:30):**  So just more continued tangible steps that again, as you've probably picked up on, for  me it's about how do we get viable farmers on the land versus the value added producers,  which are certainly important, but we need to continue to focus.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:47):**  Definitely.  And the value starts at the land and without that you cannot add anything later on.  Indeed.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:15:58):**  And if you look at, so that's a year from now, what kept you up from sleeping the last  months if you work on any projects, on any investments, et cetera, that are hopefully  now closing, you can share with us, but that kept you up the last few months.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:16:22):**  The fears of young people.  So in terms of what keeps me up at night is that they're, unlike perhaps people that are  involved in technology or other earlier stage ventures, there seems to be a good support  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:16:43):**  network for those people.  But in terms of the people that are maybe taking a different path, what's kept me up  probably more than anything is that worried about that those earlier stage folks are going  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:16:58):**  to fail because of a lack of support.  And both from a kind of a regional social system as well as others to get them through  those difficult times.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:11):**  That's what's the, as we've talked before, it's really about the people and their personal  aspirations, ability to sustain, that sort of thing.  And do we have enough of a social system around those people to get them through those dark  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:29):**  early days?  So that's probably what keeps me up at night more than anything.  Yeah, because if they fail, it sends a ripple effect through the whole sector, actually,  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:39):**  especially if they're slightly high profile, apart from all the personal losses you have  when you fail something and probably you won't try again, which is bad for all of us.  How to get through the valley of death, which also exists outside Silicon Valley.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:17:57):**  Yeah, and much more, it's much more of a concern in Europe than here.  In California specifically, we have a history of experiments failed and keep moving forward.  So it's probably more acceptable here.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:13):**  But in Europe, and certainly in Italy, there is a stigma of failure that is really paralyzing.  And that's certainly something that's really getting in the way of acceleration of these  experiments that really need to happen.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:31):**  And does it keep people from trying as well?  Yeah, absolutely.  It keeps people stuck in analysis.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:37):**  And do because you're saying that actually, this culture of trying and failing is fine,  also exists outside the technology space, but also exists in a broader, and in this  case, agriculture space in the US, and it would be great if that would be shared more  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:18:55):**  because we need more trial, but it's not just technology where failure is accepted.  Yeah, absolutely.  I think in failure in terms of I like to think of failed experiments, that does not mean  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:07):**  a failure.  Right.  So trial and error.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:10):**  Exactly.  We have no choice but to take experiments, and they can be in whatever form those take,  but we have to be in a mode of experimentation.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:21):**  And that's the thing that we're really I see young people, especially in Europe, especially  in Italy, totally paralyzed in many cases, and then not wanting to talk about it, really  getting jammed up instead of having an environment where we're kind of working through these  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:37):**  experiments, working through the trials, etc., to find the viable model.  And are investors ready to work on trial and error methods?  I think so.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:19:50):**  I think as long as we like anything, we have to take a portfolio approach.  So it's many, many experiments versus one big experiment.  We have to, you know, how do we find a series of experiments that then we can then each  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:08):**  of those learnings, you know, I didn't use the word failure, but each of those learnings  needs to benefit others within the portfolio.  And so, again, this is not an isolation.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:20):**  We've got to think about this from a portfolio standpoint.  So there needs to be a lot of openness and sharing otherwise the learning becomes a failure  because it's too isolated to be a learning for anybody else.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:36):**  Absolutely.  What a shame that is.  I mean, in terms of this, if we just see the negative part of the failing, right, so that  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:43):**  really the personal challenge and then quietly they quietly they go back to their job and  wherever.  Right.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:52):**  So it's a waste.  It's literally a waste.  It is a waste versus, you know, it's shared with someone else and they can either get  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:20:57):**  back up and try something else or someone else can can learn from that and push the  ball forward.  And how are you trying to do that in Italy, where, like you mentioned, the culture of  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:07):**  failures, it's much more culture of failures than it is a culture of learning.  It's difficult.  I'll be perfectly honest with you because it's there is a bit of a cultural clash and  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:20):**  that we I think it's through communication.  And we've talked that it's about meeting, it's about learning to talk about the benefits  of both, that there is not one good model and specifically I think this is really where  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:39):**  the connection between specifically Italy and California or Italy and the United States  that it is not one.  There's not one model that's better than the other.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:21:49):**  I think the models together are really powerful.  One of the positive things about Europe and the Italian culture is it's a long focus.  And I think if you combine that with some of the experimentation and kind of the California  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:04):**  mentality, I think if you put those two things together, I think it really, really can help  drive both forward.  Both give a better perspective to Americans in terms of the impact in long term as well  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:17):**  as from an Italian standpoint.  That there is a great upside that we live in a world where we have to experiment.  And I think the other thing is that not just meeting but bringing investors together, bringing  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:31):**  international, specifically American investors with European and Italian investors to work  together.  So these again, these learnings can be shared both at the investor as well as the entrepreneur.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:22:43):**  And when you say together, do you really mean together, together, physical, not just the  online version but bringing them, for instance, in Northern Italy in value to really share,  I mean, as they in Italy do, share meals, etc. and really connect.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:00):**  Absolutely.  Share meals, share stories, share investments.  Yeah, people getting to know each other, building trust and then taking those steps of investing  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:10):**  together.  That's extremely interesting.  And you mentioned in the call we had before that you're working actually not only on the  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:18):**  cultural barriers that they are to make this happen, for instance, to invest together in  agricultural land in Italy and agriculture entrepreneurs and farmers, but also on the  practicalities, you want to just briefly mention what you're working on on that side?  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:34):**  Yeah, just in terms of the vehicles to be able to make investments together or manage  lands together.  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:42):**  I mean, you mentioned it's both a struggle and an interesting discovery to see what is  possible and where there are actually possibilities to do these things, because probably it's  one of the first vehicles that somebody set up with this kind of focus and this kind of  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:23:58):**  long term focus as well.  Yeah, and we've worked with, you know, it's a puzzle, like anything in terms of the early  stages are.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:07):**  But we've been spending quite a bit of time working with the attorneys, the accountants,  the notaries, etc. on the Italian side to understand the pieces of the puzzle to be  able to take these investments together.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:20):**  So specifically, you know, how do we have investment vehicles that do really two or  three things?  One, joint investments by internationals as well as local Italians?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:31):**  Two, following a model of, you know, we believe that farmers need to grow into owners.  How do we find a model that allows that to happen in a corporate structure?  And then, you know, how do we have the right lowest cost model to be able to operate this  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:24:49):**  over the long term towards viability?  And so we have been spending really quite a bit of time over the last six months with  people both in the US as well as in Italy in terms of what is the model.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:04):**  I think we have some very good learnings and some first investment vehicles that we'll  be putting in play hopefully next year.  Great.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:14):**  So that was going to be my next question, actually.  When can we expect something that impact investors and investors from around the world can participate  in what you're hoping next year, which should be a great time in 2017?  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:28):**  Yeah, I think the second half of 2017.  You know, the first half is really sitting down across those tables with our local partners  to understand.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:41):**  So we're communicating, talking about the pros and cons, the models, and then making  a decision in terms of those first vehicles.  So I think the timing is certainly 2017.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:25:54):**  We'd love to take that step.  Great.  And so apart from these vehicles, if you have any advice for smart investors that want to  
**[0:26:03-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:03):**  get into the regenerative agriculture space, what would you be advising them to look at  to be careful for?  What kind of lessons have you learned and are you, of course, still learning?  
**[0:26:17-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:17):**  Portfolio and portfolio across the value chain, I think, is going to be really important.  So both as the farmer producer, value-added producers, those sort of things.  That's been my approach all along.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:33):**  That's the full value chain.  The second is beware of isolation geographically.  And so we've seen both in the US as well as in Europe, these regenerative hubs, if you  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:26:54):**  will, need to be connected to urban areas.  And so it works in tandem, trying to be in isolation, a market that's not connected to  an urban center is really difficult.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:09):**  And I think that there is prone to failure.  And so that would be the other thing is just make sure that these hubs that you're looking  at investing in, that we've got a really strong connection to the urban center and an efficient  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:21):**  connection to the urban center.  When you mentioned connection, do you mean the physical connection, so the distance or  social or both?  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:30):**  And what would be, because I think distances are different here and in Europe as they are  in the US, what do you feel like is too much or when it gets a danger to your portfolio?  Yeah, I think it is certainly social, but geographic as well.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:27:47):**  I think that we've got to be careful in terms of, well, let me just give you an example.  And it may not translate exactly to the European context, but in the Northeast, there are lots  of successful examples of farms up the Hudson Valley and within a couple of hours of New  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:11):**  York City.  Those operations get very well connected to both restaurants that are sponsoring them  as well as farmers markets, as well as brands that are building within Manhattan.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:25):**  So those are working in tandem.  And so in fact, especially in their early days from an investment standpoint, having  that tighter connection and having that relationship, defined relationship with the urban market  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:38):**  is really important.  And we've heard this from other investors who have really been in very early and at  first we're looking at very lower priced, large scale areas in remote rural areas.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:28:52):**  They really switched gears and really went back to this model where it's more of a hub  and spoke in the urban area, especially in the early days until we prove the models out.  That would be another thing just to be aware of that we've seen people all over that this  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:29:06):**  connection is really important, but certainly over the next five years.  Definitely.  I want to thank you so much, unless there's anything else you would like to share and  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:29:16):**  I can promise we'll be checking in regularly and of course follow the different projects  you're working on and hopefully share that over the next years as well.  Great.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:29:26):**  Thanks for your time.  Best of luck.  You just listened to investing in regenerative agriculture as if the planet mattered, an  
**[0:29:33-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:29:33):**  interview with Joe Beard, an impact investor.

Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:30:42):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:30:51):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  and recording this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:31:04-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:31:04):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:31:11-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:31:11):**  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  
**[0:31:15-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:31:15):**  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:31:20):**  For whom is this course?  You, the soil builders and investors in the space.  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:31:29):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management, consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:31:41):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:31:54):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:31:58):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:08):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:17):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:26):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:41):**  find if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:52):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:32:59):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/01/25/joe-baird/#t=0:33:08):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

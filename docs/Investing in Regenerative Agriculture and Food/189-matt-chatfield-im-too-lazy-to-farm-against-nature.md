**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:14):**  Get ready, because this is a long and deep one.  So take a cup of coffee or a cup of tea, sit back and enjoy.  Today we're joined by potentially the laziest farmer in the UK.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:24):**  And we go deep into why conventional farming in the UK has failed and is failing and what  can be done differently.  Why animal impact is so crucial and how you can build a very, very successful business  
**[0:00:36-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:36):**  by farming with nature, looking very carefully at margins, costs, input, and most importantly,  creating a guaranteed market and why we should all focus on ex-vegans as our target market.  Join me and learn about the fascinating journey of farmer Matt.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:00:55):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast.  Living as if the planet mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food  and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:01:08):**  people, local communities, and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:01:20):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more attention  to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:01):**  We're going to unpack a lot on sheep and connections to chefs on how to build a positive impact  on the land in the UK.  And I'm very, very excited to have Matt on the show.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:11):**  So welcome, Matt.  Yeah, hello.  Yeah, nice to be here.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:15):**  And we got introduced recently through Ophelia.  So shout out to you to that.  Obviously, anybody actually that has great guests for the show, always feel free to reach  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:22):**  out because it's the best way we we get people on.  But let's start with your with your story.  How did you I mean, not end up in farm because you actually grew up in farming, but you came  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:32):**  back to it.  How did that happen?  What made you go away, first of all, and then come back to it?  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:36):**  Because I think many people quote unquote, escape and don't come back anymore.  But you decided to actually do.  Yeah, so I mean, my whole thing was I was born in Cornwall.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:47):**  And I did start something called the Cornwall project.  But we actually have a small home in Cornwall, but we have a family farm in Devon.  It's just across the border from Cornwall.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:02:58):**  So it's very close.  And essentially, we've actually farmed the same land for at least 400 years.  So it's only a small farm, but we were basically part of a very big estate for and incredibly  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:11):**  for 360 years, my family actually farmed on behalf of the estate.  I think we were called yeoman.  So all my family are basically buried in the same graveyard and very humble people.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:21):**  But I'm one of the graveyard's actually says yeoman and I think he was born that was the  date of the Messiah and he was born in 1770.  And then so basically would have been sort of very much mixed farming for a lot of that  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:34):**  time.  And as I do what I'm doing now, I'm actually going to go through the history and I can  see what my folks basically did 400, 300, 200 years ago, which is quite incredible.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:43):**  But basically, we're in a very, very wet part of the world.  We're in between a place called Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor.  So the weather comes up Atlantic, goes up over Bodmin Moor and then dumps all the rain  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:03:53):**  on us before heading off.  So it would have been a very wet farm.  And I imagine for all that time, it would be very much mixed farming.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:01):**  So the land that we've actually got is only 80 acres.  And so my family would have farmed that and it would be very much sort of mixed farming,  you know, sort of vegetables, sheep, cattle, you know, sort of various things.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:14):**  But then my granddad was very much part of that generation of after the second world  war was like feed the nation.  And he...  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:22):**  End of world.  Yeah, yeah.  Feed everybody.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:25):**  It's very much sort of UK focused.  I feel, you know, I'll try to have a world view on things.  But very much in this country, it was I think they realized that during the war, you know,  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:34):**  we were like 20%, you know, 20% of our own population.  And so there was the advent of the sunny windows also, they built lots of like record, they  realized with the same chemicals they could make nitrogen fertilizer.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:48):**  So my granddad was basically encouraged by the government.  And I was doing research to realize that he was basically forced, like he didn't do the  things the government wanted to do.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:04:55):**  Like, you know, that potentially could be ousted from the farming.  So obviously, he was all working on a big estate, but he basically ploughed all the  land, planted dry grass, drained all the land, so all the water went off the fields and sort  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:10):**  of whatever would have taken down some hedgerows.  But he was basically the first person introduced to Friesian cow into like the southwest of  England.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:19):**  So for that time, incredibly progressive farmer, incredibly hard working man.  And he basically yeah, and it's only now, I mean, I how hard he must have worked to  try and have a herd of basically 40 Friesian cows on an 80 acre farm in our part of the  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:33):**  world.  You know, it was quite incredible.  But anyway, about 40 years ago, this UK had inheritance tax came in, which basically meant  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:42):**  all these big estates were ripped apart, basically, and a lot were struggling and had to sell.  So my granddad had the opportunity after 360 years of farming to buy the land.  And it was a huge thing.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:05:52):**  When I'm 49, but I you know, I was only nine at the time, but it was just such a huge thing  was happening.  But obviously, he then bought the land.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:01):**  But just after he bought it, like that's when things really started happening for the Danish.  And I don't want to go to like, give my views on Brexit and the European Union, but there  are a lot of pressures at the same time hitting farming, basically, particularly dairy farming,  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:13):**  and the supermarkets, you know, coaches, all sorts of things happening.  So growing up, my granddad just never encouraged us to farm.  I'd loved it.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:22):**  I wanted to farm.  My mom actually started a dairy farm, I used to help her.  But it was just never an option.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:27):**  Because I think my granddad could see the writing on the wall for small farmers.  This is before farmers markets and these sorts of things.  So the last thing in the world he wanted us to do was farm.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:37):**  So go as far away as possible.  So I did and I basically went off and was always sort of grew up very much in the environment.  I used to go fishing on my own all the time.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:47):**  I basically, you know, always, you know, quite good for, you know, the popular chap at school  and stuff.  But you know, I just always loved my own company with my dog and I'd be down at the river trying  
**[0:06:56-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:06:56):**  to catch salmon actually.  It just gave me a huge love for the environment.  So I went off into an environmental studies at college.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:04):**  And then I ended up going into publishing.  So not using my environmental background.  And then I always sort of say I got very hedonistic basically in the UK publishing like now, nobody  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:16):**  really drinks at lunchtime.  But like 20, 30 years ago they did.  So basically I went to London for 10 years.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:19):**  I worked fairly hard, but drunk a lot, had a lot of fun.  And you know, sort of forgot my farmer background.  But then my granddad actually got very ill.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:22):**  And it's one of my biggest regrets in life actually is he got a stroke.  And I was like, I'm not going to get a stroke.  I'm not going to get a stroke.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:25):**  I'm not going to get a stroke.  I'm not going to get a stroke.  I'm not going to get a stroke.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:28):**  I'm not going to get a stroke.  I'm not going to get a stroke.  I'm not going to get a stroke.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:31):**  And then my granddad actually got very ill and it's one of my biggest regrets in life  actually is he got very unwell and I just didn't take it that seriously.  And I went and saw him a couple of times and then he died.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:42):**  And it was, you know, and then it was just a hard time.  And I just realized, you know, I felt very guilty.  And then six years later, my nan who you're very, very close to, she became very unwell.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:07:55):**  So I actually moved back to Devon.  You felt very bad because of course on the personal side, but also because you sort of  lost that because you said, then I did research and understand how hard he must have worked  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:06):**  for that super crucial period in the history of the countryside and farming.  You had a direct access, but you maybe didn't mean there were probably also books in that  story.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:17):**  There was a lot there that you maybe forgot or pushed in a corner.  You sort of saw a man who was even when he passed away, you know, he was a very physically  strong man, mentally very strong, but he'd given his body, he basically had one knee  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:31):**  replaced with his waist with another knee replaced.  So he'd given his body for farming and he always liked it.  It was actually quite scary thinking if he can't do it, like how could anyone else ever  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:41):**  do it?  Like no one could work harder than him.  But I still say one memory and sometimes I cry when I say this, but our farm is basically  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:50):**  a hundred meters from the graveyards.  And when he passed away, I went up there about 5 a.m.  I had my heart, you know, when I saw his coffin, cried my eyes out.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:08:58):**  And I was like, all he ever did really was he would farm, milk cows, spend a lot of time  making sure the drainage ditches were clear so that all the water could come off and go  in the wood.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:09):**  And he then used to go once a week to Hosley Market, which is just a very small town.  You know, so every Wednesday he'd go there and that was his life.  But then when he died, I was one of the coffin bearers, so we had to walk up.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:21):**  I'd done my crying really and I thought I'm just going to be, you know, put up my face.  And I walked up and literally there were like 2000 people waiting.  It was just insane.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:30):**  And it was like, it was like this man, such a simple life, but was so well respected.  And it was, that was that just hit me like, you know, just to, you know, I always laugh  at myself now because I've got to do all sorts of things, but I've probably about 20 people  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:48):**  turned up to my funeral.  It's just incredible.  What can we learn about that?  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:09:52):**  I think there's something very deep that we don't understand on stewarding the land.  I think stewarding might be the right word.  It might be fancy words that I know, but like that, that even of course he was forced in  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:04):**  a system and blocked in a system and he did like probably the max he could possibly do  under the conditions and saw the writing on the wall, but there was no chance to change  or there was a chance to change, but you move with the system.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:20):**  If he was younger or if we had a bigger farm, the only way you could change, it seems like  dirty water systems.  You know, it's all good stuff, you know, but you had to basically collect all the waste  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:30):**  in the cattle.  You had to store it.  And this would have cost tens of thousands of pounds.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:35):**  So it was a time when even the small dairy farm won out business, all very ambitious  younger people started buying up farms.  You know, so that's, there was the beginning of, you know, and I think intensification  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:44):**  of, if he'd been a younger man, he would have done it.  You know, like if he'd been the next generation, he wouldn't, we probably have 800 cows all  feeding inside.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:52):**  Or if he would be young now, it would be on YouTube learning about the latest grazing  stuff.  I don't think he ever would have gone on YouTube.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:10:59):**  Yeah.  I do think that if he was 20 now, maybe, I mean, he would be learning.  I mean, I think that's that entrepreneurial spirit is that you probably would have pushed  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:10):**  the boundaries now.  The bit I find really interesting is, because I've now come along, probably talk more about  it, but I'm totally changing the way, you know, I've gone from what he's done.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:21):**  I'm now I'm cracking all that and changing it.  But I think his name is Gang, well after John Knight was his name, but his, his, his, his  dad and his name are both Gang, as I know him as like Gang.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:35):**  But they must have, his granddad must have, his dad must have farmed in a way that was  just with nature, you know, like it would have been the way I'm trying to do it now.  They must have had such debates about, you know, when he brought in the ditches and the  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:11:48):**  cow, the different cow breeds and must have been as big as now, like huge.  The discussion would have been exactly similar.  But the difference is, is that I'm sure they would have had arguments, but they would have  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:02):**  plowed the land.  They would have planted the rye grass, they would have put the chemical fertilizer and  it must have exploded.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:07):**  It must have seen like a miracle.  It must have just seemed like, you know, it just would have, you know, like, so I think  there's any discussion.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:16):**  Yeah, probably would have like, look, it works.  I guarantee within one year, just be like, and all the neighbors must have been like,  you know, like, it's just like, so it's a trap because if you don't do it, and you may  
**[0:12:27-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:27):**  all your neighbors do and they double or whatever the X is in that, like the multiplier is their  production and suddenly you see new roofs on their houses and all of that new cars and  stuff like that.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:41):**  The pressure to go on with that, even though maybe deep down, you know, you see some effects  that in a couple of years start to like, you have to keep adding more and more, but it's  a, it's a mousetrap.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:50):**  It keeps going faster and faster.  Like that wheel that's spinning.  And that's the tricky part.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:12:55):**  Like how do we get off that?  Because if you don't do it, somebody else does and you still have the same commodity  contract.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:00):**  Yeah.  You're stuck.  Yeah.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:03):**  But there's some, I think James Rebank, I don't know if you know, he's a fantastic guy  who I do follow a lot.  And his book, you know, he, you know, these, I didn't read it yet.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:12):**  I really have to, it keeps coming up.  For me it's brilliant because it's, he sort of says his granddad, his dad was a bit like  my granddad where, you know, he did the transformation, but his granddad before would literally sit  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:22):**  there and watch the farm and watch wildlife and watch the animals for like two, three  hours a day.  And like, cause I do that.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:28):**  He actually said that's, that should be classed as working.  My mum's of a generation where she, she's like work, work, work, work.  And she would sort of say, where are you at the moment?  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:38):**  I said, I'm working in the wood.  She'll say, are you sitting on a chair?  And I say, yes, I am.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:41):**  But it is that.  Thinking is working.  I think it is.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:13:44):**  I really do think, I mean, we'll probably talk a bit.  I hope that we can move farming or managing the land from this extremely physical, like  you mentioned with your, your grandfather, like that work that you need to work 10, 12  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:00):**  hours a day physically constantly to partly, it's never going to be non-physical.  I, of course I completely understand that, but it's also much more, let's say knowledge  and it's very knowledge intensive, but that farmers have more time to use all that knowledge  
**[0:14:12-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:12):**  and all the observations that are happening and to actually do something with it, which  means you cannot be running around 12 hours a day because then you don't have the time  to actually observe or to process the observing.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:22):**  You do the observing, but you don't process.  So I think that down, not even downtime, that makes it sound very bad, but like observing,  thinking hands off and seeing, I mean, of course we all say, Oh, let nature do the work,  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:34):**  et cetera, et cetera, but it does allow you to have more thinking time.  I know I ought to go back to answer your question, but I'm sure we'll come back to it.  Because the way I've created the market and the guaranteed market, I would say this, there's  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:47):**  probably not a farm.  Mentioning that just like this, we're going to unpack that.  There's no word.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:51):**  The guaranteed market is an interesting thing to unpack.  Don't worry.  Yeah.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:14:55):**  I probably spend more time sitting on my ass watching than any other farm in the UK because  I've got a guaranteed profit from what I do.  You know, I know I'm going to make money.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:04):**  I already see a title for this interview.  The laziest farmer of the UK.  We need to do a bit of clickbait otherwise people are going to click on it.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:11):**  I always say that I'm probably too lazy and not clever enough to farm against nature.  I need it on my side.  I think, and I always say, when you've got ruminants, you're farming with nature.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:22):**  As soon as you remove ruminants, nature just wants to try and kick your ass.  So I'm like, you know, rather than fight nature, I'm like, you know, let's just get it on my  side.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:32):**  So yeah, I would possibly say that's a very, I love that quote.  I'm too lazy to farm against nature.  But let's, okay, let's start unpacking the market piece a bit.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:42):**  If I can make a way back to, so my nan died, absolutely loved her a bit.  Spent about six months with her at the end, it wasn't a particularly nice six months,  but I then started really reflecting on my guilt really, what I felt about my granddad  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:15:56):**  and also like, how could I try and, I basically decided, I made like three promises.  One to myself, but in very real, it was, I'm going to somehow come back and make this farm  profitable.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:08):**  But to do that, you know, I've done loads of stupid ideas in my time, but for some reason,  the smartest idea I ever had was basically I can't farm and I'm never, my granddad failed  because of outside forces.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:22):**  And if I fail, I want it to be my fault.  So I decided then I needed to get a guaranteed market for what I was going to produce.  And at that time, I thought it was beef cattle.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:32):**  So I knew I had to find a way of finding a market for that.  You know, to do that, I approached my local butcher who's the very humble part of the  world, but they're probably the UK's best butcher.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:44):**  So I approached him and said, I'll go to London.  That's a lucky break that you have one of the best butchers in the UK close to you,  or did he became with you?  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:16:52):**  We didn't realise at the time, everyone locally, so a couple of places called Launceston where  I was born in Cornwall, and we just grew up with Philip Warren Butcher and he was actually  the same age as my mum, or probably a bit younger.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:04):**  And like our population of our town is about 5000.  And the Warrens, they have a retail shop where they have 7000 customers a week.  So we just grew up with them and in our heads, we're thinking every town must have a butcher  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:17):**  like this.  We just got so used to it.  Yeah, we didn't have a reference to know how good they were.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:23):**  But what they did-  You did when you went to London, I imagine.  Yeah, we didn't know.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:28):**  So I approached him and said, I know London, I want to farm one day, but if you want me  to, I'm gonna help you create a market in London.  And I didn't know anything about farming.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:40):**  So you didn't start a farming piece, you started finding your market in London, finding your  distribution channel through the butcher.  And then, I mean, that's working backwards, which is fundamental.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:17:53):**  It was the first sort of, to be honest, I look back and it was actually, that was, I  don't know if genius, it was just such a, it just seemed so obvious to me.  That's what I had, because I saw my granddad, I was just so entrenched that I'm not, I'm  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:07):**  gonna have my own guaranteed market.  I'm never gonna let someone else dictate my price.  So when I approached Philip Warren, his son Ian actually was looking to take over the  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:16):**  family business.  And I think, I don't want to speak too much for them, but hopefully they're okay with  this.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:22):**  But just try to go back and start a business.  His dad could not have made it any bigger.  I think Philip Warren actually said to his son Ian, you can come into the business, but  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:29):**  I don't see how we can make it better.  Like we've already got every single customer, you know?  So I came along.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:36):**  Everybody can drive an hour like we got, like they're here.  How can we, so I came along that time and said to him, it was such, it was a fluky time.  He said, I'll do this London thing.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:18:47):**  Ian jumped on it and then I just went up to London and started trying to build, just basically  filling up chefs.  And we found really crazy ways to get, because at Cornwall, we've got our topography as such  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:00):**  that it's wet and we grow more grass for longer in the season than anywhere else.  So if you believe the grass fed ruminants is the best, then we should be the best really.  But obviously it's 240 miles from London.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:15):**  So that's the issue is getting code stuff up to there.  So it took about a year and a half.  And enough of a boat, enough of a, because you're not going to drive with a little microvan  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:25):**  with a few kilos.  I did.  At the beginning for sure.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:28):**  But that's not.  I did for two weeks.  I drove, I drove up and down three times a week.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:33):**  And quite literally on the last winter I was driving back down again and I literally fell  asleep in the wheel and I was like, I suddenly woke up and I thought, oh, that's bad.  And I was like, this could have been the end of the road.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:45):**  I'm going to call over the next service.  And then before I did that, I fell asleep again.  And I was like, so then I pulled over and I thought, you need a different site.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:19:52):**  This isn't the best.  And then I basically, yeah, but then we moved up to London and then, and then what we did  was we found, we actually jumped on the back of the fish system.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:03):**  So there's fish going up and down to London, like a central hub.  So we basically just, everything on the fish line, I'd go to the middle of nowhere at 4  in the morning and then deliver.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:14):**  I mean, it was, I basically delivered the van for seven years and then was up there  for 10 years.  And, you know, it started, you know, small, but, you know, within 10 years, I mean, what  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:25):**  I became very good at was we didn't want to step on other people's toes.  And there was, I always sort of called the big white chefs, like all the, you know, you  can know the UK, there's quite a lot of angry white chefs in a certain era.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:38):**  And we realized that we came at a time when a lot of people, a lot of chefs who've been  to Noma, young chefs, and they weren't like the cocaine, like booze, they were very serious  young people.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:20:49):**  And they needed serious suppliers.  They needed serious, serious suppliers equally.  And about six of them all went to Noma and they all came back and they realized it was  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:00):**  all about the impact of Noma.  I think we're going to look back at that as a breeding ground, not just on the fermentation  side, because they have an amazing fermentation lab, but also just on training, like mentally  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:13):**  training a whole generation of chefs.  Well, I do have issues with Noma because I have been there, but anyway, that's never  been, I have no clue, but it's interesting.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:21):**  It's interesting.  They must be the most influential.  They must have influenced more people.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:25):**  Yeah.  So there's no doubt.  There's no doubt.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:28):**  So I'm not going to be negative.  So these chefs all came back.  Influence can be good or bad.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:31):**  I'm not saying it's.  I think the influence on chefs is great, but anyways, it's more, I won't, I won't.  So there were a number of chefs, so we had a chap called Isaac McHale, James Lowe, you  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:41):**  know, just about five or six chefs that came back.  How did you find it?  Because you were in publishing.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:45):**  It wasn't that you were regular.  Were you regular at the restaurants or you happened to find somebody at the street and  you went with your meat, like, can you please taste my meat?  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:21:53):**  Like how does that work?  I don't know.  I think like, cause I, when I was in London for publishing, I didn't even go to a restaurant,  
**[0:22:00-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:00):**  you know, I was just into drinking to be honest.  So when I went home.  You got your calories somewhere else.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:05):**  So I was like, I just wasn't.  And then when I came back to Cornwall, I just, I honestly, I look back on that and I don't  know, I don't know how it happened really.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:13):**  Like somebody inside me was like, I made this conscious of that and I'm like, I've got to  make this happen.  You're always running on, I suppose, instinct really.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:21):**  Like there's something inside, there's something like, you know, there was no logic.  It was like, I'm going to do this and that and that.  It's hard to explain, but I'm glad it, I'm glad it went like it did.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:30):**  So yeah, I literally, I remember I phoned, there's a restaurant, I don't know if it was  Chucklebarko POI, very famous British chef and he used to own a restaurant called Harveys.  He then that was taken over and it was actually called a restaurant called Chez Bruce.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:43):**  So it's one of the, so I literally phoned up the head chef, a chap called Matt Christmas.  I first ever phone called to a chef, I just lived it up and said, oh that, that's the  sort of place you want to supply.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:22:52):**  So literally what happened, phoned this guy and said, look, there's Matt Chalfield, we're  going to work on behalf of the British company tomorrow and we're going to look to send Cornish  meat to London.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:01):**  We're not sure how good it is.  Um, but you know, would you like to give it a try?  It's not a very good sales pitch.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:07):**  He literally said, mate, you sound like an absolute idiot.  Like he did literally, but you know, we'll give it a try.  So he went in and it was, it was good, you know, and for a year and a half he was pretty  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:18):**  well already customer, but he was buying whole bit and it was that kept us going.  And then, and then what happened is, there's no more chefs came back and they wanted to  know where the meat was going to come from.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:27):**  They heard that we were able to do that because the future Philip Warren, um, what made them  so special was in the UK when I like, and it was the same thing for my granddad.  It was suddenly the supermarkets came and they wanted really high protein animals that  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:43):**  had no fat because that's how they're going to make money.  So suddenly the UK, you know, we had all these beautiful native breeds of animals like the  North Devon, like the Hereford and suddenly Limousin and you know, Charolais came in and  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:23:56):**  Philip Warren basically went to all his farmers and said that if you've got the land for those  animals do it because you are going to make more money.  But if your land is wet and you know, you're, you're going to struggle.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:08):**  So what I'll do is if you, if you haven't got the right land for these big ones, keep  doing the traditional breeds and we'll pay you.  Smaller, lighter, more.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:16):**  Yeah, but just more like able to get fat on the type of pasture you've got.  He said, if you do that, we'll pay you a premium.  To turn grass into something useful.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:23):**  But he's, you know, he is a true genius for that one.  You know, just such a, you know, he came from a humble beginning, bought a butcher shop  and, but he said this one was, I will pay you a premium.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:35):**  You keep on doing what you're doing.  We'll pay you a premium.  So, and I think for a long time, you know, the trend was for lean animals in Lawson  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:41):**  and you know, his butchery shop, he just had all this like beautiful, you know, we call  it, you call it, yeah, his native animals, all fat.  And it was amazing, but then they came this generation of chefs that wanted that.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:24:54):**  They were looking for luckily.  Yeah.  Imagine if you sort of feel it, well, it must be really interesting because he was going  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:00):**  against everything.  And obviously they would make it, they also did dry aging.  So that they were having animals that are fat, they've got a lot of weight.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:06):**  They're also dry aging, which means you're losing moisture.  But he stuck with his guns and he just kept on doing it because he knew it was right.  And then we came in with these chefs and basically these chefs were like, this is exactly what  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:16):**  we want.  And you know, it was really, it was almost like you had to wait 20 years and suddenly  so word just spread that, you know, if you get to know, you had this meat that was impossible  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:26):**  to find.  And what we then did was we started bringing, there's a chap called Tom Adams, to this day  is my favorite restaurant, a restaurant called PicQ.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:33):**  It was the beginning of like the street food thing.  Tom has spent a lot of time in the US, came back, started the coolest restaurant ever  called PicQ.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:40):**  He was quite 22 at the time.  Like what is it called?  PicQ?  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:43):**  PicQ.  P-I-T-T-C-U-E.  Perfect.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:47):**  Now I'll put a link below as well.  And so he started that and he was 22.  He started doing like a street food thing under the South Bank in London.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:25:55):**  It just went crazy.  He heard what I was doing, met me and he literally asked me three questions that I couldn't answer.  And I was meant to be like a middle man, but luckily I'm probably the worst middle.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:06):**  Like if you're a middle man, you better keep people apart.  And you know, you don't want your butcher talking to the chef.  You want to keep all the rest.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:12):**  So I said to Tom, I can't answer those.  I'll tell you what you do, let's jump in the van for the weekend.  We'll pop down to my butcher and you can go meet him.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:20):**  And then he came down.  It was the first time we brought a chef down.  And as soon as they met, like two obsessed people, one obsessed with, you know, like  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:27):**  you could just see like this is fire.  It was just literally like, it was, it was funny.  I actually do a food photographer.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:35):**  He actually came along with the trip with us.  So it's all there on camera somewhere.  Like, I mean, just a little thing.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:40):**  So for Shaperoox, we were doing whole rib, taking off the bone.  So Tom Adams came in.  This is actually a true story.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:47):**  He's watching this happen and then we're taking it off and then we've got the bone, the rib  cage.  And Tom says, what'd you do with that?  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:26:54):**  And they said, well, we trim it, take that out for pasties and then we have to chuck  the bones and the bones actually pay to get them, you know, sent for waste.  And Tom said, well, why don't we, if you just cut it along the time, I'll take that.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:06):**  And then I'll, you know, so he ended up paying 80 pence a kilo for something that was costing  us money.  But then he was, he then became a very famous dish, you know, like rib on the bone there.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:16):**  And they were charged with eight quid a portion.  You know, like it was just when you saw this happen, like, right, so we're not, we're saving  money, you're making money.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:23):**  It was just brilliant.  So then it became a bit of a, all these ambitious chefs, because I was doing all the deliveries.  I was getting up at 4am in the morning, meeting all the chefs in the morning, being a bit  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:32):**  of a gossiper to be honest, getting quite well known for that.  But then it became a bit of a thing like, if you want to get this meat, get to know  Matt and then he'll take you down to Cornwall and then you can meet everyone.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:41):**  And it suddenly became this like, tour agency, yeah, well, yeah, like, or a club, it just  became a club and everybody, it was, you just knew, was there enough meat?  Like this, I mean, was there, like, did this mean that suddenly your butcher, if it was  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:27:58):**  like having to seek other people or was there enough supply or what?  I don't know.  The supply was never ever an issue.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:06):**  The thing is, with butchery, you just need to, supply is not an issue.  Like in Cornwall and Devon, on the border, there's just so many, you know, we've got  problem with the moor.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:15):**  What you've got is a system where you can, animals can be born on the moors and they  become, you know, born in a very healthy environment and then we bring them down and get them fat  on like, very fertile river Tamar Valley.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:26):**  So because Philip Warren had got all these farmers to do what they were doing, we had  just all this.  But the issue was more, it's just balancing carcass.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:35):**  It's always been the issue is if you, I think Philip Warren says, you know, one of those  phrases is like, you lose money on the bits.  You know, anybody can make money on the loins and the, that's what it was like, but you  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:46):**  need to be able to balance it.  So that was the, that became my job then was to find customers who would not only buy the  less desirable quote unquote pieces.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:28:56):**  And those are chefs.  I mean, chefs can play with that, can do amazing things with waste, which you just mentioned.  That's something you have to pay for to get rid of.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:03):**  They turn it into a dish.  But then there's, if you look back on Twitter, I remember because we were looking to grow,  but we just needed to be able to get rid of the offcuts.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:14):**  And then literally a company, a guy just put it on Twitter saying that we're looking to  start a company in Cornwall called Hubox.  They were going to get a seige and make a burger.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:23):**  And they said that we're looking for mince and corn.  So I just thought it put them in touch with me and Warren.  And now they've literally got like 20 burger places around the Southwest.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:32):**  So as we've grown, they have.  So they literally take all of the offcuts, turn it into, so that, and now that, you know,  just things like this is crazy.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:41):**  And you could have been doing this for, and you are for a long time.  What made you decide?  I mean, of course you promised it to your grandmother, but to get your hands into farming,  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:29:52):**  the farming as well, not just because you probably saved actually quite a lot of farms  by selling these pieces into London for good prices.  Yeah.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:00):**  Well, how do you love also what it just made them.  Like feel really good.  Cause like, you know, at some point we started selling the Harrods and like in Cornwall,  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:08):**  but we were selling to a place called Lebray, which is just, you know, we'd see certainly  that stage of recognized being the best restaurant in the UK.  But obviously in Cornwall, no one knew.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:17):**  That was quite the idea.  But then we started supplying Harrods and then suddenly like it was actually just gave  huge, you know, you go back there and that was when it was like, you know, the Warren  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:26):**  supply Harrods, you know, the same thing that you're having, you know, in the counter, you  know, you're having like, you know, the,  the urban rural suddenly there was a huge amount of pride.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:36):**  Yeah.  It was a lot, you know, and suddenly it was like, Oh, you know, so, so what was your question?  Why farming again?  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:44):**  Why farming again?  Why farming for you?  So I sort of,  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:47):**  You created the market.  Let's be clear.  Like the market was there.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:30:50):**  When I knew, yeah.  Then I'll be honest, I then I got fairly good advantage of seven years and it was actually  very mentally and physically very, very taxing.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:02):**  But last couple of years, the value, you know, you're on your own a lot and it was, and I  felt never further away from what I actually wanted to do.  So on the face of it, yeah, we were getting quite popular, becoming quite social, knowing  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:12):**  lots of chefs and some LA, you know, becoming a bit of a face on London.  So I'm actually, you know, yeah, came quite well known for what I was doing.  So I'd, like the YBS Young British Foodies doing award, like honorary title.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:23):**  And then I was called, I think Maverick at the restaurant.  I was still driving a van.  I sort of laugh because at one point the evening standard in London, do a lot of the most influential  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:34):**  1000 people in London.  And I actually managed to get on it.  Most are still driving a van.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:38):**  So I sort of say I was probably one of London's most influential over van drivers.  But I then, it's probably thing I started taking over kitchens and getting chefs to  do pop ups and things.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:48):**  And then I ended up taking over a pub in a very cool part of East London.  And we just, you know, this is actually where I started doing the mountain actually, but  it just went mental, like, so we call it the Cornwall project.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:31:59):**  The whole idea was, you know, by supporting, by giving London very high produce, high quality  produce, we're going to support local economy.  We took over this very, this pub and it just went mental and just became like a huge thing.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:11):**  And the guy who owned the pub then basically we worked, started working together.  We actually got ourselves a very cool pub in Fitzrovia in central London.  So I took it over and I ended up then basically became the landlord for two years.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:25):**  And I would say possibly very good at keeping people happy.  The actual running of the pub, not so great, but we actually managed to get it our first  year.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:36):**  So it was a pub and restaurant, it was tiny.  We got a big one, which, you know, I've had chef mates for 10 years who never got one.  I became, you know, like Faye Masher, the famous evening standard reviewer gave us like  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:48):**  four out of five.  You know, it was, it was quite a weird, it was a thing, but I'd never felt further away  from it and after two years actually me and my business partner fell out.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:32:58):**  And then the weirdest thing then, this is where it all sort of happened.  Because at that time I had two others on the Facebook, I was doing fantastic work, you  know, being talked about by the press and all this, but I've never actually been as  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:08):**  unhappy.  And when I say unhappy, I was really, you know, probably suffering depression.  So I just know that I just didn't feel connected to Cornwall, felt a bit stupid.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:17):**  Then I basically ended up, a mate of mine had a houseboat in Shoreditch.  I ended up basically leaving the pub, living on a houseboat for two years.  And that's when it all started happening.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:27):**  And one of the funny stories I always say is I've lived there for two years and I'd  walk around and every morning, like it was a beautiful bit of London, like it's all urban,  but there was just so many bits of wildlife.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:38):**  And every day, like, you know, like Grey Mullet would come up on the estuary and you'd be  able to see them and there'd be coots and swans and like just all sorts.  And I'd go out every morning, just naturally looking at, you know, like how, you know,  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:48):**  how the ducks are doing.  They've had six chicks and they're all right.  You know, the Egyptian geese, how they're doing.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:33:52):**  And in my head, I was just every morning just going around looking at them.  And then we had like a meeting of the boat people, like, and I just sort of said, you  know, it just became obvious that no one else was interested in what all these animals were.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:04):**  And then I suddenly realized I'm basically doing what I would do in the farm.  I'm going out every morning, checking all the animals were all right.  But at that stage, I then, because it started getting into nature again, and then I just  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:16):**  started, I suppose it corrects us, I could see it suddenly became very apparent that  all the work we've done, you started hearing about plant-based food, the vegan movement.  You started hearing about rewilding and the environmental aspects of cattle.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:31):**  And I suddenly realized that shit, all this work we've done, perhaps it's for nothing.  Perhaps we are doing bad.  And then happens, I've watched a YouTube video of both Alan Savory, which I think is a lot  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:41):**  of people, you know, quite a contentious figure, but, and obviously his idea was actually...  Not in our crowd, I think.  No, I think, so I watched the famous TED talk and basically it was, we don't, you know,  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:34:54):**  we actually probably need more remnants if we're going to save the planet.  And I'm like, well, that sounds too good to be true.  But you know, it's only saying, if something sounds too good to be true, then it probably  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:03):**  is.  I then just went, that's when it really started.  So I basically then started watching YouTube probably for like 12 hours a day for like  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:10):**  two years.  And just suddenly got obsessed with regenerative.  So I got very obsessed with identity politics and what I could see in America.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:18):**  I was worried that seeing what was happening in America, identity politics, I could see  it linking with the vegan movement.  I could see these movements in London.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:23):**  I just became really, I basically, I remember like in this country, Brexit happened and  Trump got in and I had the pub at the time and I was just totally oblivious.  And suddenly I was like, I've got myself really stupid.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:36):**  I've been doing all this, fan-driving, doing this.  I'm dumb.  I need to get smart, like quick.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:43):**  So that's, so basically it was a two year period of just so much information.  On a houseboat watching YouTube.  Yeah.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:48):**  To understand farming.  They probably thought, I was like, why is everybody thought like I was on heroin or  doing something terrible.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:54):**  Like that guy's just always doing this.  We don't see it.  But I was just literally just watching.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:35:57):**  And if I saw an interesting farmer, I'd go and see them.  So I visited at the time quite a few farmers in the UK and then the biggest moment.  So you were not completely solitary in the houseboat.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:09):**  No, you went, you went to visit luckily.  I still working the rides, I still looking at the chefs.  I was in my houseboat and then, you know, but one bit, the amazing bit, I've always  
**[0:36:19-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:19):**  felt that Hamon is the best meat in the world.  And I got an invitation, you know, from my widow things to go and speak, to go and meet,  you know, some of the farmers.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:29):**  And I think it was happened upon, they're basically the best Hamon supplies in the world.  And I spent, I went there and spent like a week with them.  And I just realized like, it's a real pithy of how do you get the best meat in the world?  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:44):**  And then I was suddenly like, actually to get a world class animal meat, you need to  have it's walked around a long time.  So the Iberico pigs for a year and a half, they're actually foraging for a living.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:36:56):**  They're like trying to find all sorts of stuff.  It's very dry conditions.  They're actually, you know, so for after a year and a half, they literally weigh 80 kilos.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:04):**  They're really thin.  And then they put them in the acorn trees.  And within four months, they literally double their weight.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:10):**  So to get a lot of muscle at the beginning.  Yeah.  So yeah, not a lot of fat.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:14):**  And then suddenly fat.  So to get world class meat, you need an animal that's walked around a huge amount of his  life.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:21):**  And then at the end, then you need to put fat cover on the end.  And obviously, and that was like, cause we've done mutton frequently when I was at the pub  like three years before.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:30):**  And it was just incredible.  I just suddenly hit me, this is the reason that's incredible.  I suddenly realized no animal in the world, well any domesticated animal has walked further  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:40):**  than sheep do.  And sheep get to a certain that, you know, once they're ready to be killed, they've walked.  Like, God knows.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:47):**  So then it was like, let's just get those animals and put fat on it.  Surely, and I knew a lot by then about aging of meat and the processes.  So it was just like, right, actually, I think I've got an idea to go back to call.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:37:59):**  I'm going to call mum.  So I call mum at night.  Right, I want to come back.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:02):**  Mum had a lot of issues.  My stepdad, you know, that she's going to be getting a divorce next week.  But they were losing, they still taking over the farm and they were just losing loads of  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:11):**  money and it was just a disaster.  So I came in and said, right, I've got this idea.  I want to basically buy about 80 oats, get them fat and see what happens.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:20):**  And so bless mum, you know, she gave me the chance really, and we did it.  And there's a real hunch.  And I remember going to Philip Warren at the time.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:29):**  What did he say?  He said, honestly, the number of Ian and Philip Warren are just, they're two, my father and  son, you know, Ian's learnt so much from his dad, but they are just so astute businessmen  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:38):**  and they just know instantly whether an idea is good or not.  They just know, you know, and over the 10 years I knew them, I told so many ideas.  And he just used to look at me like, this is why it won't work.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:51):**  And I'm like, and the same with Philip Warren.  So I went to Philip Warren and I got this idea of basically fattening oats.  And he went, literally, Matt, that's a brilliant idea.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:38:59):**  And I was just like, what?  That's the first time you ever said that.  Yeah, it was like, and I was just like, he said, the main reason you got ideas is because  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:05):**  you've got an analyst board a long way, you're going to put fat on it.  But he said the real clever bit is sheep produce something called laminin, which is basically  producing the glands and it waterproofs their skin.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:15):**  But when you eat lamb, that tacky flavour, that's actually laminin.  After about six or seven years old, sheep stopped producing it or produce it, and it  also there's no tackiness.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:24):**  So he said, by that age, people will be expecting it to be tough and tacky, but if you can age  it, dry age it, it'll be tender, and there'll be no tackiness.  So it'll just be the exact opposite of what you're expecting.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:36):**  And as soon as I heard that, I'm like, shit, that's, you know, okay.  And then my next piece of luck was just before, this is like three and a half years ago, I  went to something called the Oxford Real Farming Conference, again, because of my learning.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:48):**  It was literally four months before I started.  And I was still then like, I heard about his Regen Ag stuff, but I'm going to have to go  back and I'm going to have to use a fertilizer, I'm going to have to do this, you know, and  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:39:58):**  I just didn't know how to do it.  So I went and met a chap called Chris Jones, who's very into the old beaver thing in the  UK.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:05):**  There's a bit of a secret beaver club going on in the UK.  I think I listened to a book.  Did he write a book?  
**[0:40:12-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:12):**  Derek Gal, who I'm actually quite probably mentioning, I recognise the name.  So Derek Gal wouldn't be like Chris Jones or not, you know, but he's just a beautiful,  incredible man.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:25):**  And I saw him, I went to talk on basically, I went to the Oxford Real Farming Conference.  How to fatten them without all the inputs?  Yeah, it was the old way.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:34):**  So I went to Oxford Real Farming Conference, thinking I was going to take up farm, but  it's thinking I just don't know if I can farm.  And I happened upon a talk by a chap called Steve Gabriel, and he farms in upstate New  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:45):**  York.  And he was basically coming from a conservation environment background a bit like me.  And then he had sheep in upstate New York, they had a horrific drought.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:40:55):**  Everyone sheep and cattle were struggling.  And he was really struggling.  He then just thought, right, I've got a word, I'm just gonna put the sheep in the woods.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:02):**  And then two months later, they came out looking like, I sort of say like rock stars, like  and he was like, so then he's gone really deep into this.  So he talked about silph pasture, and he talked about it very much as a drought resistance,  
**[0:41:13-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:13):**  you know.  So when I then, which is funny for you in a place where it's wetter than anywhere else.  Yeah, of course, no longer.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:21):**  Exactly.  I mean, I mean, it was just such a good time to be honest that, you know, all these things  happen by chance.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:27):**  But I am he Yes, I saw this.  And then afterwards, there was question answers.  And actually, Chris Jones from Cornwall.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:35):**  So I didn't know Chris, but I heard him talk.  It was so lovely because this Steve Gabriel was like the most gentle, gentle spoken man.  And Chris just started swearing and just so charismatic.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:45):**  And I'm like, I've got to meet that man.  So I went down and met him.  And it was honestly was the most inspirational words I ever heard.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:52):**  This changed my life really.  They were like, I'm not gonna waste your time.  And I certainly don't want you to waste mine.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:41:57):**  But do you want me to sum up everything I've learned in 50 years of farming in one sentence?  And I'm like, okay, of course.  And he said, if you farm for nature, labor looks after itself.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:08):**  And to me, because I knew a lot about nature, and I was very unique in farming where I was  starting with flavor.  I was so used to delivering meat to chefs and tasting it.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:16):**  You know, that to me was like, I can do that.  Like actually, and ever since then, I've had some of my best mates.  We grew up together, still mates after 40 years.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:27):**  And they've all actually been comprehensive kids, you know, no background, but they've  all gone off and done really well in their own field.  We all met up about three months ago, and they all said, even though they're very successful,  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:38):**  they're still actually like they're going posture syndrome.  They just don't feel like how am I there.  And when I was doing a restaurant, even though I got a biblical modelist, I felt like I was  
**[0:42:46-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:46):**  an imposter.  But since when Chris Jones said those words, I've never ever, all I've ever felt is I can  do this.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:42:54):**  Like, I can, you know, like, it was just a, I can do this now.  Like, and I've never looked back.  It was, if I had heard those words, I don't know.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:01):**  Yeah.  So I went back to family farm.  We had a small home in Cornwall.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:06):**  I was able to do a bit of sheep there.  My stepdad was being really, really pretty nasty, actually.  He was really trying to make me do this.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:13):**  So I went to the actual family farm, but he was stepdad was farming all the land, absolutely  horrifically terribly.  But we had this, well, so we had this, I don't know, I think he asked me questions.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:24):**  I'll just go with it.  But basically, I've seen this talk by Steve Bing and by Steve Gabriel.  And we, when we grow up, so obviously all my granddad, he basically ploughed the land,  
**[0:43:35-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:35):**  drained it, but that water had to go somewhere.  So basically it went into our ancient woodland.  And so,  
**[0:43:41-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:41):**  Now you remember the talk at the conference.  Yeah.  So when we were growing up, so it basically, all the water went in there for 40 years.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:43:51):**  So when we grew up, we literally weren't allowed in there because cattle would go in there  and actually get chest deep in mud.  And you know, like it was so, so my nan, he was a very strong character.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:01):**  And she just never allowed to go in there.  Anyway, when I came back to the farm, I was really upset because I just see my stepdad  do this horrific stuff.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:08):**  I then thought, I'm just going to go to walk in the woods.  And also I went in there with my nan in my ears, you know, she'd been passed away like  10 years.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:15):**  But like, you know,  You basically went in there with like, floating things around your waist just to be ready.  I literally was just like, any moment I'm going to die.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:23):**  And then I suddenly walk around and I'm like, this is ancient coffins.  This is like, this is like, you know, this is ancient coffins.  This is, we used to farm this.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:32):**  Like this used to be managed.  Obviously, you know, that'd been a few hundred years ago.  You could just tell.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:37):**  So I went to mum and said, look mum, I know I'm not allowed to farm the fields, but can  I go in the woods?  Farm the forest.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:43):**  Yeah, mum was like, do whatever you want.  And that was, that was my chance.  It just gave me that in.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:46):**  And it was all these things that happened.  And then, so then I just basically, for one year, for the first winter, it was pretty  tough.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:44:55):**  It was like mud.  I'd never even used a chainsaw.  I've started chopping down trees.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:00):**  But it was the absolute making that, you know, that it's all those weird things.  And now I, you know, what I'm probably most well known for now, and to be honest, I've  been quite, I wouldn't be doing it three years, but I'll be quite cocky.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:11):**  But I've just literally been interviewed this week for UK sheep farm of the year.  So it's just after three years, it's pretty quite crazy.  But I think what I'm really well known for, A is putting mutton back on the map, making  
**[0:45:22-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:22):**  London restaurants, you know, high end.  But I suppose what I'm really well known for, if I am really, is basically going to woodland  and compensating it, basically showing what can happen if you add remnants to an ancient  
**[0:45:36-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:36):**  woodland.  You know, like it's, yeah, it's just been a making move really.  What's the change if you would like that first time you walked into that, into the woodland  
**[0:45:45-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:45):**  and just try to make it visually obviously, because we're in an audio podcast.  And if you would go into that same, if you're still farming that, how different is it?  Like how does it feel, smell, sound?  
**[0:45:56-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:45:56):**  What's really interesting is my uncle Lanthionne, like a half acre bit.  So we've left that.  That's totally like it was.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:02):**  And next to it, we have a bit which I've done.  So when you go in there now, right, even now, it's basically all the canopy is totally full.  It's totally full.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:12):**  So no light at all is getting into that canopy floor.  You can't hear any birds.  In the piece that you left.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:18):**  Yeah, in the piece you left.  This is the control.  This is the control side.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:21):**  Yeah, it's the control area.  Leaves are still there from last year.  So even though the leaves fell, so after nine months, leaves are still there.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:31):**  So basically to me, and there's literally, I work quite closely with guys in the Eden  project.  I don't know if you know about the Eden project in Cornwall.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:37):**  There's a guy there obsessed with plants who comes and actually measures everything I'm  doing.  So just summarizing, there's almost like no life.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:44):**  There's no life.  So basically it's dead and there's literally six plants coming out of the lawn.  There's wood soil, there's ivy, and there's a few other things, but that's it.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:50):**  So basically you go in there, I think to the UK, you would think that's like your perfect  beautiful woodland, but it's just dead.  There's nothing, like it's dead.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:46:59):**  So now where I've now gone into my bit, all I've done is coppiced a few trees, the hazel,  the willow, silverbatch.  It all comes back, coppiced it.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:09):**  I've then put in sheep where I think it's right.  If you go in there in May, and it's all on video, like it's all on my YouTube, but also  the BBC actually came to film it the first time I ever put sheep in three years ago.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:22):**  If you go in there now, especially in May, there's literally 160 plants from the seedbed  have come up.  It's now probably one of the most productive bits of land, probably in the UK, and you've  
**[0:47:34-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:34):**  got trees coming up coppiced, they eat those, they eat the grass, and it grows.  The fields, where I'm a devil, it's just so, for farming, I think if you get depression,  you get like mental health issues, because nothing's growing.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:47:49):**  In the winter, towards that last March and April, nothing's growing, but the woodland  starts growing in mid-Feb.  Spring happens six weeks earlier, and it just comes alive.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:03):**  All it is, and this is all from the seed bank, so seeds can probably last in the seed bank.  Nothing planted, it's just been there for 40 years.  You go into one bit, it's dead.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:13):**  You go into the next bit, and it's like you cannot.  All I've done is coppiced, blit and light, and then put in sheep when I think it's right,  pull them out, and it's just night and day.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:27):**  I have chefs down all the time, and within, I always say, within five minutes of visiting  my farm, you'll realize everything they say about sheep and ruminants is just nonsense.  There you are.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:36):**  Yeah, I was going to ask, you almost went down the vegan route, but you didn't.  What did they teach you over the last years on the impact of ruminants or the importance  of ruminants?  
**[0:48:50-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:48:50):**  If you had to summarize that, not even short, but what would you tell these chefs when they  come and say, I've heard about the impact of methane and blah, blah, blah, and we should  all eat plant-based burgers?  
**[0:49:02-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:02):**  Of course, this is characterizing it, but how do they go through that transition in  five minutes?  I'll tell you an absolutely true story.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:09):**  There's a lady called Hannah, she's happy to be talking about it.  We started selling my sheep online, and then she started buying it, and then I saw her  name pop up, and then she contacted me on Instagram and said, can I chat to you?  
**[0:49:24-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:24):**  I want to send you a few questions.  So she sent me a few questions.  She ended up sending me an email that was just so long, and just reading it, I'm like,  
**[0:49:32-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:32):**  this lady, Hannah, she's got issues.  She's obviously got mental health issues associated with food.  She's just so in-depth.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:38):**  So I said, I'll tell you what, I haven't really got time to answer this.  I think it's better than wanting to come down.  So she basically came down to visit, and as I picked her up from the station, we drove  
**[0:49:47-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:47):**  her back to my farm.  And she basically said, Matt, the truth is I hate animal agriculture.  I think it's all wrong.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:49:55):**  I've been eating for seven years.  I've been vegan, and I was going to die.  I had to eat meat.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:04):**  So then I saw yours, and ethically, it looked like something I could, at least it looked  ethically like a good thing.  And obviously, I'm driving to my farm thinking, oh shit, if we get to my farm and she doesn't  
**[0:50:17-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:17):**  like it, like, she got there, and I was quite emotional because she just saw the sheep,  and she literally started crying.  And I was like, it was just, you know, so I'm like, so what I say to people is, what  
**[0:50:30-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:30):**  I say is, so when I went through my two years stage, I ended up, I started debating, so  I went on Twitter, and I followed the, you mentioned earlier you followed me on Twitter  there.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:41):**  I'm like, Instagram is my sales and marketing division, but I'm really nice and lovely,  and it's all about stuff.  But I call Twitter my political wing.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:48):**  But for two years, I just talked to re-wilds, and I talked to vegans, and I talked to environmentalists.  So I think what I did was try to, in my head, come up with something to answer every single  one of their questions.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:50:59):**  So I think I've probably come up with the farming system that can answer all those questions.  And the one thing I say is, I was in my caravan the other day looking over my pasture.  It's quite late at night.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:08):**  A barn owl come over.  It was clearly was hunting over my pasture.  I took a photo, and this dear old vegan chap just went, grow vegetables instead.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:17):**  I went, okay, right, let's unpack that.  And I just said, mate, you see this field there, right?  I literally kill 20 sentient beings per acre per year.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:27):**  I fatten 20 sheep per acre per year.  So I fatten about 600 sheep on about 30 acres of pasture and 10 acres of wood.  So I'm not afraid about that.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:38):**  I kill 20 sentient beings per acre.  Right.  But if you want me to grow veg, I'm going to have to plow that field.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:44):**  And when I plow that, I'm probably going to kill 10,000 sentient beings.  I'm going to kill shrews.  The buzzers won't be able to feed me out here.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:51:51):**  And then I said, if you want to grow potatoes for at least three or four years, hardly anything  is going to live on that field.  So not only am I killing everything when I start with, I'm ruining the ecosystem for  
**[0:52:00-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:00):**  the rest of it.  But if I just keep on killing my 20 sentient beings, and I'm giving them a good retirement,  then I create an ecosystem for literally tens of thousands of sentient beings.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:11):**  So when people come and visit, it's just within five minutes, you just get it.  So now it's now really hard arguing with these.  They don't really come and debate me now because I think they know they're just going to come  
**[0:52:28-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:28):**  over and have a bit of a personal crisis because I think pretty quickly, I'm just quite good  at getting to the point.  Did you ever have not that reaction, meaning an opposite, like somebody that came and didn't  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:44):**  have that switch?  No, it's just, honestly, it's very interesting.  If you show people this bit of wood we haven't touched, and then you show them what I have.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:52:57):**  And also, the sheep just seem so happy.  And all the sheep I'm getting, I'm basically buying sheep that would have been killed six  months before.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:07):**  So you're giving them an extra X month plus creating that.  We had a discussion with Charles Eisenstein here actually on that piece.  Death is part, I don't want to paraphrase, please go and listen to that episode.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:22):**  But death is part of this agriculture system or the stewarding the land if we like it or  not.  It's a very good case of you can't escape it if you eat potatoes or if you don't.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:34):**  And there is a strong case to be made to actually graze it.  Also from the environmental and all the emission side of things.  But let's leave that to the LCA people.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:42):**  But what does it do coming back to the flavor, like that woodland mix with pasture?  Because your hunch was it was amazing.  Your hunch of your butcher was it's going to be amazing, but did it end up being amazing?  
**[0:53:56-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:53:56):**  Yeah, it's obviously what happens is all the flavors in the meat already because they've  done all their walking.  What I'm now trying to do is get incredible flavor on that fat.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:06):**  And with fat, what happens is like I want animals as thin as I can get so then I can  add totally lean fat.  And when you dry age, that fat permeates into, if you do it properly, it permeates into the  
**[0:54:19-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:19):**  meat.  So it's so important.  Now my woodland, because I'm Dan Ryan from the Eden Project, we think my family probably  
**[0:54:27-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:27):**  grazed it with animals 400 years ago and probably stopped 300 years ago.  The climate in Devon apparently changed dramatically 300 years ago.  It became even wetter, so we probably haven't managed that for 300 years.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:40):**  I would say every single plant in that wood is communicating underneath the soil with  a mycelium network.  And obviously if you've got one plant growing in a field, the fungi is feeding, like it's  
**[0:54:58-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:54:58):**  doing its bit to try to get the nutrients from its surroundings.  But if you've got a whole mycelium network in a whole wood that's been there for at least  300 years, the stuff that it's doing on the soil, the stuff it's extracting, you can see  
**[0:55:09-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:09):**  it like I went to my wood this morning, and the vibrancy of plants, you can see the vibrancy  in plants.  I think we do need to start measuring the nutrient levels and things, but you can see  
**[0:55:23-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:23):**  when a plant is firing, it's luminous and it's bright green, and everything in my wood  all the time is bright green.  It's just like, you just know this crazy stuff.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:36):**  So these sheep, they're eating that, and my job is to try and make them as relaxed as  possible so their fermentation is good.  I do sort of, I've got issues slightly, I think like say sourdough things, I think in  
**[0:55:50-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:55:50):**  London, in East London, people are forgetting that the whole e-gen thing is about sourdough,  and I actually think it's about the luminance.  But all these people are like, they're getting such a high profile for basically doing fermentation.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:04):**  And I'm like, you've got sheep, that's what they do.  You need to respect them more, because I'm sure they're a lot better at getting the nutrients  and that, but you just, if I can get those animals, and my job is to make them as relaxed  
**[0:56:18-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:18):**  as possible, because what sheep would do, they go and eat in the morning, they then  go into their first stomach, comes up and then they chew the cud, and then it goes back  down.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:27):**  And that's the bit that's really important.  I want sheep, sheep farmers do this thing called alive or dead, where they go into a  field, don't worry, it's not cold.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:35):**  You'll see a sheep.  No, no, I'm interested.  It was an interesting phase.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:38):**  You'll see a sheep just zonk that, and you just think that's dead.  You go to, you then get close to people, farmers are like alive or dead, they do a video, alive  or dead, alive or dead, and then you'll get, and the closer you get to it, before it jumps  
**[0:56:50-0:56:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:56:50):**  up, because basically it's fermenting, it's just relaxing, it's chilling, it's just there  like letting this body just get all the nutrients.  So what I want is my sheep looking as dead as possible during that stage, because I know  
**[0:57:00-0:57:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:00):**  then they're extracting every bit of nutrient and that's going into their fat cover.  And they never are dead, you know, one day I'll do it, like live, and it might be dead.  So my sheep are owed and the other one does die, and not less than I thought actually,  
**[0:57:12-0:57:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:12):**  but my whole job is to get them eating incredible stuff.  But also the remarkable thing is I've got 150 plants growing in that wood.  It's obvious they self-heal.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:21):**  I mean, everyone talks about it, it's not like it's a bird, I witness it every day in  my life is sheep, because I'm getting old sheep, you know, there's some farmers decided  they're not good enough anymore for breeding, you know, he's going to send them off the  
**[0:57:32-0:57:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:32):**  abattoir, I'd like those.  Some of them are quite healthy, there might be a reason why, you know, he's offloaded  them but more often than not, it's just that, you know, they're at an age where they just  
**[0:57:41-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:41):**  they can't really process enough glass to feed them in the lab.  But I just put them in the wood, and I like a simple like, they just come out looking  like rock stars, like, they just, sheep they're healthy, they'll go in there, eat a bit, but  
**[0:57:54-0:57:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:57:54):**  they'll just want to go back in the field and like get fat, but the ones that are not  too well just stay there.  So I just basically lock them in, you know, and then they just get healthy.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:03):**  The transformation is self medicine.  Yeah, obviously, I've just seen it so many times now, like, well, sheep, you think you're  buggered, put them in two weeks later, they just come out.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:12):**  And then to be honest, I think their body gets into balance.  So and then they then get fat, you know, my job is to fatten sheep, put a fat couple on  them, you know, but but also the beauty of my system is, and where I suppose if you go  
**[0:58:24-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:24):**  on my Instagram, where I, you know, become quite well known as well is, I remember the  first sheep you got, literally mum, we bought like 60 sheep.  And mum said, right now you need to farming, right?  
**[0:58:36-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:36):**  You must never, never name an animal, never get emotional, you know, you've got to be  tough and brutal.  Like, you know, these are the years to get fatter, so okay, cool.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:45):**  Literally, got this first 60, the sheep came running up to us, just like basically wanted  to be pet, you know, petted.  And mum, just looking at mum like, oh, Jesus Christ.  
**[0:58:54-0:58:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:58:54):**  So basically, what happens with sheep is, obviously, they've got two teats, and if they  have triplets, there's always a spare lamb, and often a farmer will bolt feed that.  But then you basically humanize the animal.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:05):**  But then they ended up, you know, going back into flock.  So every time I buy one of those, and it's not very often, I'll buy a flock of like two  years ago, I bought a flock of Dorsets, which are quite lovely sheep, but they're quite,  
**[0:59:16-0:59:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:16):**  they're not particularly big fans of people, but there's one Dorset that came running up.  And I've kept that one, so I've now probably got 10 sheep.  What I now have guys, farmers who've got their own 10 lambs, they send them to me.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:26):**  So I've probably got four sheep that are basically pets of my other farmers, but their kids have  grown up.  I've got six of my own, and I call them my management team.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:36):**  So what's incredible is you just learn things, don't you?  So I'll buy sheep from Bob and Moor, they probably see a farmer twice a year, they're  wild as hell.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:44):**  They come into my field, and they'll-  You have these 10 managers that keep them in check.  Yeah, they'll be like, so I've got about 240 sheep.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=0:59:51):**  So you get 40 sheep, they'll arrive, and they'll look at me like, they basically look at me  like I'm a wolf, like a predator.  The first thing I do is then get the dog in, Morgan, he's quite funny, and that makes  
**[1:00:01-1:00:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:01):**  the sheep suddenly get together.  But these sheep are still very scared of me.  I then walk into the field, and literally 10 sheep come running up to me for a cuddle.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:08):**  So I'm there just basically cuddling sheep, and all the other sheep are literally just  staring at me.  They are just staring at me.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:16):**  But then the next time I go in the field, they don't move a muscle.  I can walk around the whole flock, and not a single sheep moves.  And they say, sheep have got the best facial recognition of any animal on earth.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:27):**  They have to, you know, like your lambs, your mum's faces all look very similar.  They obviously can tell by the bar.  So within a sheep, as soon as you walk in that field once, they'll remember you.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:38):**  So obviously when I go in the second time, it's just quite cool.  And I mean, it's a potential robot, but what's next?  What would you envision?  
**[1:00:48-1:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:48):**  Now you have to set up this system that works really well in your farm.  You have the guaranteed market.  You spend quite a bit of time looking at your land, looking at your sheep, which is great.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:00:59):**  What do you feel is okay?  And you've learned all this stuff on the ruminant impact on land and on woods, which is incredible  because we look at woods in many places and think this is sort of the optimum state of  
**[1:01:10-1:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:10):**  et cetera.  And you've shown that that's absolutely not the case.  Like there's a whole world beyond that.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:14):**  We look at very degraded land, honestly, that could be regenerated.  What do you see?  Because you're not close to any type of retirement.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:23):**  Like what do you see as next step?  I was just thinking, we ought to talk about some sort of idea to invest money.  There's something called the government.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:34):**  I'm trying to work it away, but I don't need to rely on government money.  It's possible.  But for me, the UK government, I think Europe's heading in this direction is basically investing  
**[1:01:45-1:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:45):**  in big corporate companies, investing in offsetting carbon.  By doing that, the government's going to let people plant trees and sort of the idea of  offsetting.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:01:59):**  For me, there's something very interesting they're looking at, which is like nature recovery  schemes.  What they're looking at doing is you need to have 500 connecting acres and I've only  
**[1:02:09-1:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:09):**  got 40 at the moment.  My auntie's got 40.  It's definitely aimed at the big landowners and trying to get farmers working together.  
**[1:02:18-1:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:18):**  It has to be 500 acres of connected land.  But for me, in my woodland, we've got something called a willow tree and a willow tree is  actually UK's fastest-growing breeding bird.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:28):**  And I've actually got loads of them.  I've got a lot of them in my house, but I'm not going to be able to get them to come down.  And that was a funny story.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:36):**  So they did believe me.  Over the winter, I was feeding all the birds and the thing.  And I've been an orthologist.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:39):**  Willow trees look really similar to marsh tit, but there's just slight differences.  I phoned at Devon Wild and I just said, no, I think I've got willow tit and they said,  no, you probably haven't.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:47):**  They're going to be marsh tits.  They're very similar.  I went, okay.  
**[1:02:50-1:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:02:50):**  They said what we'll do, we'll come out in spring.  What we'll do, we'll play the voice, the song of the male willow tit.  And if there's any in there, it might take hours, but they'll eventually come and try  
**[1:03:03-1:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:03):**  and fight the territory.  I said, okay, cool.  So they came out in spring and there's no word of a lie.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:07):**  Choked with Rob Purdy, very good mate of mine.  First time I met him, came down.  We literally got 20 meters from the woodlands.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:12):**  And he went, I don't need to do anything.  You've got willow tit.  We then walked into the wood and literally, it's all on Twitter, it's all on Instagram.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:20):**  There's a video of two willow tit building a nest, literally like 10 meters from where  we walked in.  So basically what I'm looking at doing is we've got the river Kerry, which yeah, runs  
**[1:03:31-1:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:31):**  along and we've got a very ancient railway line that hasn't been used in like 70 years.  So my idea is to try and access, buy or lease the land on the railway lane, and then basically  start trying to connect the railway line and the river and start increasing the breeding  
**[1:03:48-1:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:03:48):**  grounds of the willow tit whilst farming in a way that feeds people and helps nature.  So that's my big project now is, and I think that government scheme, it's not totally official  yet.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:02):**  They're doing trials, but I think for investment, looking at that would be really interesting  for people because I basically, there was a bit of land about a mile away and because  we all had money going on sheep and it's going on, we're actually building a barn for the  
**[1:04:14-1:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:14):**  fresh.  I just said to someone, someone's interested in this land, you know, you can buy it and  I'll rent it off you.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:19):**  It's just on Instagram.  And about 20 people contacted.  I was like, oh, right.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:22):**  Okay.  But that land's so, but I think there's going to be, for me, there's going to be, it's obviously  legislation is pointing towards big corporate companies offsetting, particularly like the,  
**[1:04:39-1:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:39):**  you know, the property sector, you know, big property developments.  You know, I'm pretty old-fashioned on this and I've got friends who do it and I've been  looking at it for a couple of years, but to me, it's a bit of a con for our government.  
**[1:04:49-1:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:04:49):**  It's a bit of a, it's aimed at landowners.  It's going to encourage corporate companies to buy out farming land.  I think personally we need to keep people farming and we need to try and get small landowners  
**[1:05:02-1:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:02):**  working together and looking at these nature recovery schemes.  And basically I think, and then we could start using the technology that's there.  You know, we can use like true technology to measure biodiversity, water storage and  
**[1:05:15-1:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:15):**  carbon, you know, securitization.  And so how do you envision that as a, would it be some kind of, because of course it's  very interesting to get this land, to buy this land or lease it very long-term, but  
**[1:05:28-1:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:28):**  then there's always this, this little, this, this pressure of speculation, like to sell  it in X years or flip it because, which happens in the real estate because of, and so how  do we counter that?  
**[1:05:40-1:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:40):**  How do we make sure this is long-term, is that you are able to farm it long-term or  others that are farming with nature and producing food for people?  Like how do we make sure that land doesn't become the speculation ball that we just keep  
**[1:05:51-1:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:05:51):**  kicking around and people make a lot of money on the transactions?  I would say like the more we need to look at how we are going to structure the offsetting.  For me, it's pretty, I mean, obviously the winter UK, you know, it's the summer, end  
**[1:06:08-1:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:08):**  of summer of 2022.  It's been incredibly dry.  We know getting incredibly wet winters and we're getting dry summers and especially dry  
**[1:06:18-1:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:18):**  springs storing water.  And I think worldwide storing water is going to be the most important.  Instead of draining everything.  
**[1:06:24-1:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:24):**  Yeah, it is.  You know, bless the beaver folks, I'll tell you, I'm a big beaver, but I think the more  we go into the place, so if you, if you, the more organic matter you get, the more carbon  
**[1:06:33-1:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:33):**  you've got in the soil, the more water you, you hold.  So for me, it's almost like water storage is the biggest factor.  And so I think working, getting that measured first of all, so you've definitely got, you  
**[1:06:46-1:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:46):**  know how much water you're storing on your, you know, and if you look in the UK at the  moment, the sewage companies are just putting so much sewage into the water, you know, rivers  are low and it's just, you know, this Armageddon.  
**[1:06:59-1:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:06:59):**  Those water companies, I actually worked with South West Water for a bit.  They did give me a bit of money to do some fencing, but I totally ignored it because  I wanted to fence in a different way.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:06):**  But it's near and dear to get farmers to hold that water on land, get it clean on land  before it goes in.  So I think there's a huge, huge opportunity there actually.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:14):**  So water storage.  So basically, so I think my idea would be, you know, I was only just sort of thinking  about it, I don't know, is get people either long-term leasing or buying land, but if they're  
**[1:07:25-1:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:25):**  buying land, they would be all part of a big pool of people and hopefully they would get  money for offsetting, they would be getting money for carbon.  There would be the return basically.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:33):**  I would be partly leases, partly small leases and some ecosystem services.  I know that I can guarantee that I can make an income for my sheep and it's, you know,  I've only just scratched the surface of what's where I can take this.  
**[1:07:48-1:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:48):**  But I then also think I will introduce cows into my system and I think I'll introduce  chickens, you know, like, and what I really want to move towards is like motor stores  growing within woodlands.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:07:56):**  I think that's where the real, that's where we can produce huge amounts of food.  So I want to focus on those things, but meanwhile use the willow tit as a way of expanding things  because you know, the more they just go where I'm doing stuff with the sheep, there's no  
**[1:08:10-1:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:10):**  willow tit in my uncle's bit, but the willow tits every time you work and it's not big  surprise.  It's a canary in the corn mine.  
**[1:08:16-1:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:16):**  Yes, yes.  But on the good side of things.  Yeah, it's yeah, so yeah, willow tits in the wood, like it's not a big surprise.  
**[1:08:22-1:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:22):**  Nature, like the idea that we have deciduous, I see what happens when you just get deciduous  wood without ruminants and it just, the calving comes over and in time it just dies.  That's what a lot of the rewilding people taught us.  
**[1:08:35-1:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:35):**  Like it's not like you need management, like it's been managed for centuries and if we  like it or not, we have to take our role as the key certain species and with the managing  ruminants and you cannot just put a fence around and let everything out and hope that  
**[1:08:49-1:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:08:49):**  nature magically reaches some kind of equilibrium.  Well, there's quite a few, I mean these are the people who hate me most.  So there's a growth of people who, they're just throwing wood throughout and fencing  
**[1:09:01-1:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:01):**  off woodlands.  Things are growing and people are treating them like some sort of Messiah, but I'm like  mate like people are going to think you're a genius for 20 years, but you're going to  
**[1:09:11-1:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:11):**  die and then 20 years after you're dead, people are going to realise what an idiot you were.  And I'm quite, and they're like, they'll get really upset and I say, I'll tell you what,  I'll go and take some photos.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:21):**  So I'll pop down and an hour later I'll take the photo.  You can just see it like this.  It's so weird when you get up.  
**[1:09:26-1:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:26):**  I've thought about like how different managed woodlands, like you could just show it or  even listen to it.  Like if you just listen to the incredible audio of the two forests or the two woodlands  
**[1:09:39-1:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:39):**  next to each other.  And I've seen there was an exhibition by, of course, I forgot the name, but he recorded  a lot of nature sounds and projected it on a wall.  
**[1:09:49-1:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:09:49):**  So you could see, you can not only hear it, but you could see where the Jaguar came in  and you could see, because it was another line and it was a fully dark room in Milan.  And you could basically, the full wall was of course, very high, really big room.  
**[1:10:02-1:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:02):**  And you could see the sounds coming in and you could hear the difference between a forest  that was even selectively cut.  Like you could not see the difference.  
**[1:10:11-1:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:11):**  Apparently on pictures, the forest both look equally healthy, but you could hear the difference  because it was selectively cut and there was less wildlife.  So I think there's something on that sound piece as well.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:21):**  I make it a visual again to see, like we can, you feel the difference immediately when you  walk into there, but probably it's easier to comment on Twitter than it actually is  to go and say, okay, let's look at the difference between managed and not managed.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:31):**  I think you're right.  It's quite fascinating.  Yeah.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:34):**  I've got a feeling my mate, Bordie, well, either when I was talking about earlier on,  I think he might've sent me that actually.  I will send it to you.  
**[1:10:41-1:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:41):**  I will find it, put it in the next below.  I'm sorry, I forgot the name.  It's a very famous artist for sure, but the nature sound part is so, so you're going to,  
**[1:10:52-1:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:10:52):**  you have to get to big scale because otherwise you cannot participate in these schemes.  Yeah.  And I think for me, I'll keep it out of the corporate hands.  
**[1:11:00-1:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:00):**  Cause we've been farming a long time and like, cause we're like an established family.  My granddad was so respected, but my stepdad obviously wasn't.  I always say with farming, and I think, I think people, a lot of people are scared about  
**[1:11:13-1:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:13):**  getting into farming and they think they'll be treated.  But I always say with farming, and I've proven it to be honest, is if you, if you just, obviously  I do social media, but if you just keep your head down, work hard and pay your bills on  
**[1:11:27-1:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:27):**  time and you're not a twat or you're not like, you know, you're not an idiot.  After about three years, people start taking you seriously and it's taken me three years  and now finding people who are actually, okay, he's alright, he pays his bills, you know.  
**[1:11:41-1:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:41):**  I think people are getting locally, I'll be getting to, you know, and I think what's been  very dramatic for me this year is my whole farm has been about giant resistance ever  since the inspiration of Steve Gabriel.  
**[1:11:55-1:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:11:55):**  So the way I farm is that grass grow long, strip graze it, push it down, produce some  mulch.  And this year, you know, it's just so noticeable.  
**[1:12:04-1:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:04):**  If you drive past my landline, it's literally way, way 10 days ago, everybody else had no  grass at all.  Their grass is just appearing.  
**[1:12:10-1:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:10):**  Their grass has exploded.  And I've got 240 sheep on a very small farm and they've got their no strip grazing and  it's just works.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:17):**  It just, you know, so I think no farmer can know, every farmer, you know, you keep such  long each other's land.  And I've already got a tiny tractor, so I can look over hedges, but all the other farmers  
**[1:12:27-1:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:27):**  have got huge tractors.  They can look at mine.  It's just, they would have thought really strange seeing these sheep strip grazing,  
**[1:12:33-1:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:33):**  but now it's just so noticeable.  I think people locally are beginning to, they will start thinking.  I think really he's not like his stepdad, he's like his granddad.  
**[1:12:43-1:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:43):**  And I think as soon as they start thinking now, I think they'll get on the side.  And I think this year that's, I would like to think that's happened really.  But it will take a lot of work.  
**[1:12:51-1:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:12:51):**  But the beauty is, because you've got this railway track, it's now all woodland.  I don't need to have the land right next to me because if I've got the railway track,  I can have a land that's a mile away, but it will still be connected.  
**[1:13:01-1:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:01):**  But I can, like, connect it.  And the same with the River Kerry.  So I think that's how, so I don't need to worry too much about the land right next to  
**[1:13:08-1:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:08):**  me.  So that's, that's, could be another.  Is it somewhere connected to the archery basically?  
**[1:13:14-1:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:14):**  Yeah.  And it was just being, if you plant the rice mulch tree, between me, well, I said between  me and you.  
**[1:13:19-1:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:19):**  There are a few other people listening.  When I actually walked down the track and there's a land about a mile away, I actually  saw a willow tit in there.  
**[1:13:26-1:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:26):**  So they're obviously already using it.  Like, you know, it's like, it's just already, you know, like, I wasn't going to tell anybody  that.  
**[1:13:34-1:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:34):**  But I think it's.  Maybe it was the other one.  Maybe you didn't see it correctly.  
**[1:13:38-1:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:38):**  But the other thing I think in terms of investments, which I don't know why people.  So what would you tell investors?  Let's say we're not in the Oxford, the farming conference, which would be fun, but we're  
**[1:13:50-1:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:13:50):**  on stage at, actually there's an upcoming one.  Probably it's out when this is way out after that.  But in Amsterdam, we're sitting on stage, a lot of bankers, investors, family officers,  
**[1:14:00-1:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:00):**  et cetera, that are excited to follow you on Instagram or other people.  And what would you tell them?  Obviously without giving investment advice, but where to look and how potentially to put  
**[1:14:10-1:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:10):**  money to work?  Well, I'd say firstly, I look at the economic press, actually the financial press, and I  have to say, I think the standard journalism is pretty dreadful.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:20):**  That's why we're recording this podcast.  It's just, they just rehash press releases.  It just drives me wild.  
**[1:14:27-1:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:27):**  Like yesterday I saw something about you need to invest in proteins.  What I'd say is, if you don't want to invest in, if you don't think Regen Aguero is right,  then invest your money in alternative proteins, but also invest in the pharmaceutical industry  
**[1:14:41-1:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:41):**  because one is going to lead to, and it's just fat.  If you eat the sludge that they're proposing you eat, then you're going to need pharmaceuticals.  So those two go together.  
**[1:14:50-1:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:50):**  If you're not going to do that.  Basically if you invest in that, you're creating a market for your pharmaceutical investments,  which is a fair strategy.  
**[1:14:58-1:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:14:58):**  Yeah, it's brilliant.  So good luck to you.  But if you actually like humanity-  
**[1:15:03-1:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:03):**  Don't call Matt.  No, what they was talking about is, they're talking about the vegan, you know, the growth  in vegan people.  
**[1:15:11-1:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:11):**  I think what's becoming very obvious, that without government intervention, without raising  taxes for meat, lockdowns are proving that very few of the population are into the alternative  meats, the beyond burgers, the impossible meats, those sorts of things.  
**[1:15:26-1:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:26):**  So at any one time, about one to 2% of the population are vegan.  The vegan did their own research six years ago.  They never talked about it, but they did their own research.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:38):**  And it shows that 84% of vegans give up after one year.  And I did some rough sums.  So at any one time, so 1% of the population, say the population of the UK is 60 million,  
**[1:15:50-1:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:15:50):**  it's probably 1 million vegans at any one time.  A year later, about, well, 840,000 of those will be ex-vegans.  So I reckon there's probably in the UK now about 10 million ex-vegans.  
**[1:16:03-1:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:03):**  I think those people are wonderful.  They obviously care about the planet.  They do care about sentient beings, but they've gone through the process where they're realizing  
**[1:16:12-1:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:12):**  that actually being on the vegan diet is, for some reason, they've given up, haven't  they?  That market is the one that I, they're the ones buying all my private sales because they're  
**[1:16:22-1:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:22):**  looking for incredibly ethical farming systems.  So I would say focus on that.  No one's really talking about it, I haven't heard anybody talk about it, but that's the  
**[1:16:31-1:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:31):**  fastest growing, most ethical market in the UK.  And they don't have to eat meat, but I do think it's obvious to me that you need animal  fats of some sort.  
**[1:16:41-1:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:41):**  So I would personally, where I would invest a lot of money is...  That's my perfect next question.  What would you do?  
**[1:16:49-1:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:16:49):**  Like you would fork like a billion dollar, a billion pounds, surely.  Like what would you, how would you put it to work?  I would get Jersey cows, I would basically, arable is where we can make the most change.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:02):**  Where we're farming now, we can produce really incredibly healthy livestock.  We can produce really healthy Jersey cows, for example.  What you need to do, we need to start basically, at the moment all our farming systems are  
**[1:17:15-1:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:15):**  separate, dairy, highland, arable.  And it's not rocket science, it's what they used to do.  So where I would put huge money in is mobile dairy units on arable systems.  
**[1:17:26-1:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:26):**  And I would, and it's happening in Germany, there's lots of systems now.  But to me, if you can make the dairy part of the arable system, so you do the Dried  Grain Aggy glazing a cow, you've got a mobile system.  
**[1:17:38-1:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:38):**  And then to me, you can then start measuring that milk.  And I'm sure from a regenerative system, it would be so, so good for you.  The cattle are outside, maybe you need to work on the...  
**[1:17:50-1:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:17:50):**  Would you then do your arable system in a permanent pasture way?  I mean, the wild farming people, and how do you make sure there is not just leftover from  whatever they were growing?  
**[1:18:00-1:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:00):**  How do you make sure the cows get their...  My friends of mine have got a 800 acre arable farm in Hertfordshire.  We're slowly beginning to work on getting sheep as part of the system.  
**[1:18:10-1:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:10):**  But you imagine, at any one time, you probably want to do arable for three years, and you  want to graze for three years.  So you basically, if you work down that farm...  
**[1:18:18-1:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:18):**  Basically as a separate, as part of the rotation, not necessarily grazing the arable.  Yeah, not grazing the arable.  So basically, you need to have your herbal legs, whatever you do, to get that soil working.  
**[1:18:31-1:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:31):**  You need cattle to do that.  You need to cover crops.  Yeah, you need to cover crops, get that working, have a mobile farming system.  
**[1:18:37-1:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:37):**  So you're then protecting the milk.  And they're basically regenerating the land.  You don't need to use fertiliser.  
**[1:18:44-1:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:44):**  And those animals, it can be...  If they're the right animals, I think they need to move away from fusion in the host  arm.  
**[1:18:50-1:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:50):**  We need to move towards Jersey cattle.  They're just more...  They're able to turn that product into something that's just incredible.  
**[1:18:58-1:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:18:58):**  I love fusion, so I grew up with it.  I probably love them a lot more than I love sheep.  But I think they don't fit.  
**[1:19:05-1:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:05):**  As an animal, we need to go back to the animals that can turn all of that, what's growing.  And that's why we do need to start looking towards that.  If you're going to raise cattle on those systems, like the red room, so herifers, that sort  
**[1:19:19-1:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:19):**  of thing.  So basically, I've got a friend who is called Fred Price.  And he really wanted to interview Fred.  
**[1:19:27-1:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:27):**  Fred's just a genius guy, probably, I think, early 30s.  Went to Oxford, Cambridge.  His folks had a 200 acre arable farm.  
**[1:19:34-1:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:34):**  He went to Oxford and Cambridge, came back and went to the farm.  His parents were horrified.  But he basically became like the...  
**[1:19:40-1:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:40):**  They sent him there, and then he came back.  But he basically became the best chemical farmer.  He was using chemicals.  
**[1:19:48-1:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:48):**  His yield was going up, but he was spending more and more money.  And then one year, everything just crashed, like yield crashed.  And he was the best person to talk to that I ever had to talk about this.  
**[1:19:58-1:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:19:58):**  But also, it's happening worldwide now where your soil just can't do that chemical process  where it just...  It doesn't matter how much nitrogen you put on, the soil is done.  
**[1:20:06-1:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:06):**  So then what he then started doing was planting herbal lice.  He gets Tamworth pigs.  And he now, we help him, we help his supply chain.  
**[1:20:15-1:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:15):**  So we move him up, which we set him up in a restaurant in London.  They boil his Tamworths.  But now he's like five years in.  
**[1:20:23-1:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:23):**  It has to be seen to believe.  His pigs are basically his input.  So he's making money on his input.  
**[1:20:28-1:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:28):**  And he's now producing like heritage world class grains.  And he is part of that sourdough cool East London thing.  So perhaps I shouldn't stack them up too much.  
**[1:20:36-1:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:36):**  I just...  Like a good slice of bread with some interesting butter, some interesting baking.  I mean, it's part of it, but it shouldn't only be that fermentation like we learned  
**[1:20:46-1:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:46):**  happens in ruminants, which is important.  But I did some sums.  And this is the exact...  
**[1:20:50-1:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:50):**  Actually, I have friends in Northern Ireland who got in touch with me about three years  ago.  They wanted to talk about something.  
**[1:20:55-1:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:20:55):**  So I did some sums for them.  And the most...  This needs to go to the economists out there.  
**[1:21:01-1:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:01):**  Obviously, you need to take me...  I wouldn't say the pinch of salt, but I looked at how many pigs Fred was producing from his  land.  
**[1:21:09-1:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:09):**  And then at the moment, we've got 9 million pigs in factories, which I have hauled.  And it's got...  That's...  
**[1:21:17-1:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:17):**  But if 20% of arable farmers in the UK did what Fred did and used pigs as part of their  rotation, then those 9 million pigs could be taken from factories and put on land.  And then I think in time, you're going to realize that because he's not paying for chemicals,  
**[1:21:35-1:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:35):**  pigs are his chemical.  They're always fertilizer.  He's actually making money from his input.  
**[1:21:40-1:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:40):**  So in time, I think...  Making money from your input.  It's a...  
**[1:21:44-1:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:44):**  I mean, yeah.  That's the one...  I wouldn't say one of the tricks, but how do you switch that conversation to how do  
**[1:21:53-1:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:21:53):**  you grow as much food for people without all the inputs or actually make money from inputs,  which is the ruminant or the pig?  But that's such a mental flip that you have to see it to believe it and then do the numbers  
**[1:22:06-1:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:06):**  and then still probably many people would say, no, it's impossible.  It sounds so good to be true.  Think about it.  
**[1:22:11-1:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:11):**  I think we've talked about this.  Even a funny flip is what we say down here is, I want to try and talk the farmer's language  and the whole regen thing.  
**[1:22:19-1:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:19):**  Like farmers down here, they just raise their eyebrows.  And so what we think is...  I think at the moment I'm regenerating my land.  
**[1:22:24-1:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:24):**  I think my granddad did these things.  My stepdad did even worse.  I'm now using the sheep to regenerate it.  
**[1:22:29-1:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:29):**  But once it's regenerated, when it's working, I'm then moving to low input farming.  So basically spending as little as you can, unless you spend, unless you need to make.  But now it's only thinking like, you could be a high input, but the pigs, because you've  
**[1:22:47-1:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:47):**  got pigs on it, it's actually a high input, but it's just not one that you're paying for.  Do you know what I mean?  We're talking about a low input system, but actually, so at the moment I've got 240 sheep.  
**[1:22:58-1:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:22:58):**  It looks like too many, but they're every day, they're quite big.  They're probably pulling out six kilos of poo a day.  Yeah.  
**[1:23:07-1:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:07):**  So the input, but of course the input doesn't come from outside your farm gate, which you  didn't put.  But I think that's the...  
**[1:23:13-1:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:13):**  We forget that in agriculture, if you run it like a business, we would never ask that  question to a bike factory.  I have said it on the podcast, people are not going to say, yeah, you already mentioned  
**[1:23:21-1:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:21):**  it.  But you would never ask the question, can you squeeze out as many bikes?  It doesn't matter your input cost.  
**[1:23:27-1:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:27):**  It doesn't matter your labor costs.  It doesn't matter if you have to run 24 seven, whatever diesel generator you have to put  on.  
**[1:23:32-1:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:32):**  Like we only want to know your output.  And somehow in farming, like the number of bikes and bikes, and somehow in farming, we  always ask only that question.  
**[1:23:40-1:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:40):**  We never ask, but actually what did it cost to produce this and how far did it come from  or the environmental cost, the financial cost, just the issue of having all these lorries  come on your land to bring stuff and then you have to get on your big tractor to ride  
**[1:23:55-1:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:23:55):**  it out.  Like it is input and output and we never talk about the input.  We never talk about the output, which is ridiculous from an environmental and from an economic  
**[1:24:03-1:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:03):**  perspective.  Yeah.  And apparently you run systems, you are able in general, you, the general you that are  
**[1:24:10-1:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:10):**  way less input or even zero with really good and amazing output that we are find difficult  to believe and does really good margins.  I mean, when I started three years ago, I wouldn't dare have more than like a hundred  
**[1:24:25-1:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:25):**  sheep, strict grazing.  Which is interesting and you're like this whole feeding the world thing.  Like there's a limit.  
**[1:24:31-1:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:31):**  It's like we say much land is under stocked and overgrazed, but it turns out to be really  true.  Like there's so much more possible than...  
**[1:24:39-1:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:39):**  I've now got 240 sheep and I'm actually, and that's after a drought, I can actually go  up by another 60.  Like my land, I think there's some questions you asked me before and one of the questions  
**[1:24:51-1:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:24:51):**  I, one of the things I want to change the most is a either journalist...  You're really like bringing up every question I want to ask.  It's amazing.  
**[1:25:00-1:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:00):**  You're doing my job.  Like what would you change?  Great question, Matt.  
**[1:25:03-1:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:03):**  Thank you for this.  It's going to be my final one because I was starting to approach the, I think the longest  interview I ever did, but it's absolutely fascinating.  
**[1:25:11-1:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:11):**  So thank you for making it until now.  If you're still listening, what would you love to change?  There's two things.  
**[1:25:16-1:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:16):**  One is either not just the journalist and the economic press, but journalists either  need to sort themselves out and actually start thinking critically rather than leading press  releases because, or we just need to ignore mainstream media because they're just, they're  
**[1:25:30-1:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:30):**  just at the moment, journalism's gone very wrong and they're just, they're so like obsessed  with where they are in the, you know, like, and when I see in the food industry, you know,  bless them, some of friends and they know I say things like this, but you still need  
**[1:25:44-1:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:44):**  to start getting on board, you need to think critically about everything you're told.  So on that point, you know, so if the journalists aren't going to sort this stuff out, you just  need to start looking elsewhere for information.  
**[1:25:55-1:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:25:55):**  But the thing is what's happening at the moment with farming and everywhere is everyone's  talking about peer reviewed things.  Like, so I'll, I, you need to start.  
**[1:26:01-1:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:01):**  Where is the peer reviewed papers?  Yeah, yeah.  It's all the time.  
**[1:26:04-1:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:04):**  Where's that peer reviewed?  I'm like, mate, like, you're not being weird.  I've got six months going and that one I've got 140.  
**[1:26:07-1:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:07):**  They said, no, but I need to get statistical data.  I'm like, mate, like, this is the worst thing I've ever done.  I'm like, I'm not going to do this.  
**[1:26:10-1:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:10):**  I'm not going to do this.  I need to get statistical data on like, like, like, here's a photo.  Go with two people, look at each other.  
**[1:26:17-1:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:17):**  You are your peers, you're reviewing and look at the difference.  So I think like, we've got to stop.  I think we do actually need to listen to farmers.  
**[1:26:26-1:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:26):**  We need to trust the judgement of what farmers are seeing with their own eyes.  And if they take a photo, you know, like, and I mean, I've just taken bank statements  in mind, but we need, you need to start realising that farmers, all we actually want to do is  
**[1:26:37-1:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:37):**  feed people and actually earn enough money to live.  Like we're not like, we don't actually want to destroy the planet.  Like, like start working with us and trusting us because like, I, you know, I sit there,  
**[1:26:48-1:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:26:48):**  I'm probably four or five hours a day just watching my land and walking looking and like,  no one knows that better than like, I know that I know what's going on.  So start, start trusting what farmers are saying.  
**[1:27:00-1:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:00):**  And one thing I would say is my granddad was told to feed the nation and he did it.  And within two years he turned the farmer out.  Farmers are capable of changing things incredibly quickly, like if they need to and everyone's  
**[1:27:12-1:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:12):**  onside, like farmers can do it, but we need to agree on, we need to agree on how much  carbon are we storing in soils?  Because that's the base thing at the moment.  
**[1:27:23-1:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:23):**  One science says, one people are saying, he doesn't store much carbon, you only put it  so deep.  And other people, other scientists are saying we're storing loads.  
**[1:27:30-1:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:30):**  We need to get that right.  Plus, are we, are everyone actually storing carbon?  How much are they storing?  
**[1:27:37-1:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:37):**  Can we agree that if they're not, we'll get rid of them, we'll eat fake meat.  But if we are, if that's how we want to get carbon from up there down the ground, we need  to then work out how to do that.  
**[1:27:49-1:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:27:49):**  Hope that answers that.  And how does that, because you mentioned before the water piece is almost more interesting  or more, seems to be easier to measure, like water holding capacity.  
**[1:28:00-1:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:00):**  You see all these great videos on YouTube and Instagram of very dry land, recently grazed  land, like a cup of water upside down, see how fast it goes in.  I mean, that's, you don't need a peer review paper for that.  
**[1:28:10-1:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:10):**  Anybody can see what's your, at least what's your infiltration rate is very easy to do.  Like, do you see that as a, as an easier in than all this fluffy carbon talk?  I think, I think it's, I mean, there is no drone technology where they can measure, they  
**[1:28:24-1:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:24):**  can send things up.  I think these things are actually all incredibly measurable now.  But this is.  
**[1:28:32-1:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:32):**  They are.  So the infiltration, the vegetation, you can see quite a lot.  I like, so my granddad, I literally had a talk last week, there's a guy who's quite  
**[1:28:43-1:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:43):**  home, George Monbiot, I had a bit of a blow up last week.  There's another cat called, a guy who, you know, they may be lovely people, but I'm not  a big fan.  
**[1:28:53-1:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:28:53):**  Anyway, they start talking to me and all these people just piled in and started to go at  me and they're like, mate, how'd you know you're holding more water?  You know?  
**[1:29:00-1:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:00):**  And I'm like, well, I just, I walk every bit of land every day.  Like I know, but I said also my granddad put these drainage pipes in.  When I started in the winter, they would all, all the water would rain and it would all  
**[1:29:11-1:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:11):**  come out.  You know, I can see it.  But now after three years, like every year, less and less and less and less, like, you  
**[1:29:17-1:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:17):**  know, like, it's not coming off there.  It's staying on that.  Like, you know, believe me if you want, but like, I'm telling you, that's, it's obvious  
**[1:29:30-1:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:30):**  to my land.  So they say for every percentage increase in organic matter, you hold 20,000.  I'll show you photos.  
**[1:29:36-1:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:36):**  We had like 20,000 more litres and it's just true.  Like you were there three years and I've done nothing that no one else can do.  All I've done is strip graze sheep.  
**[1:29:45-1:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:45):**  That's all I've done.  Nothing, you know, now we've got electric fence.  I've done nothing on my farm that no one else in the whole country can do.  
**[1:29:54-1:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:29:54):**  But the man of war is now holding and it's obvious from the start, you know, my roots  are still getting that water that was drained, you know, the total surface is dry, but they're  getting, you know, like it's just, you know,  
**[1:30:07-1:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:07):**  You're getting funkels now, your neighbours, like are they, I mean, they, they, they look  over the fence, over the hedgerows with, on the big tractors, but are they, are they starting  to knock your door?  
**[1:30:15-1:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:15):**  Like, we thought you were crazy, but your grass looks amazing.  I have started seeing, there's a dairy farm offset and they've started strip grazing their  dairy cows and I've never seen that in like 40 years.  
**[1:30:27-1:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:27):**  So yeah, it's quite interesting.  There's a satellite picture of, I think it's March Shepherd's farm from above, obviously.  And you can see which neighbours have started putting key line design in.  
**[1:30:38-1:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:38):**  It's amazing.  You can see, you see his farm and then you see the others and you see where it stops  like exactly and everything is straight again.  
**[1:30:45-1:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:45):**  And then you see these really nice curves.  And so you can see the spread almost.  And of course, if you talk to him, you would know exactly which ones are where and how,  
**[1:30:53-1:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:30:53):**  et cetera.  But you can see this impact probably on yours as well.  You could see over the next years, you can see how it is like the greener grass and the  
**[1:31:01-1:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:01):**  better growth grass because that all you can measure from satellite pictures.  That's not so difficult.  What would be more interesting is, so I used to play cricket.  
**[1:31:07-1:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:07):**  I don't know where you are cricket, but like I used to play for my local side 30 years  ago and for 25 years I was in London.  I then came back and started playing for three years ago and they're all sheep farmers and  
**[1:31:21-1:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:21):**  they like put up with me for three years.  They actually, they, you know, they see my Instagram, they call me like the Instagram  farmer, but they actually, I did an event on my wood.  
**[1:31:31-1:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:31):**  Like an American company came over to the bank and there was some tickets.  I invited some of the cricket guys along and genuinely like they were blown away.  Like they just, I mean, this is the bit I can, I've had chefs like that.  
**[1:31:46-1:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:46):**  I can get anybody who doesn't know farming to come to my land and if I want to, I can  get them thinking I'm a genius and the best farmer in the world.  But it's not true.  
**[1:31:53-1:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:31:53):**  But your neighbour farmers and your cricket mates are different.  Yeah.  Within a nanosecond, by the time they parked their cars and walked towards me, they already  
**[1:32:00-1:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:00):**  knew if I was a poultry or not.  You know, they just, it's like, is he making money?  Is that, you know, and I had so much grass and I was doing it so differently and like  
**[1:32:08-1:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:08):**  the bits and their grasses stopped growing by then and I, cause I had, you know, it was  just all day and one of them was so, I don't think I really think about it.  The next day I was also cutting hay and the guy said, you know how much, you know, he  
**[1:32:21-1:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:21):**  actually very kindly got his mate to bail it all out and we got a really good yield  on my hay and he just said something so nice on, you know, basically like, you know, mate  actually you're a pretty good farmer.  
**[1:32:31-1:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:31):**  That was all it took.  Obviously I feel emotional.  That's all it took was him, like an actual farmer to go actually mate, like, you're pretty  
**[1:32:38-1:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:38):**  good.  Like it was like.  The imposter syndrome was solved.  
**[1:32:41-1:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:41):**  Yeah.  But to be honest, I sort of, I know it sounds cocky, but I just know it's working.  You know what I mean?  
**[1:32:49-1:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:49):**  It was lovely to hear from them, but I sort of, you know, when I was doing the restaurants  and chefs, I knew it was bullshit.  I knew it was nonsense.  
**[1:32:57-1:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:32:57):**  Like, you know, I knew how good I was.  It wasn't very good, but this, I just, I'm not saying I could be good on another farm,  but on my family farm, I know I couldn't be, I couldn't be trying harder to be better.  
**[1:33:10-1:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:10):**  You know, I just, if I went to another farm, who knows, I'd probably cock it up.  We'll see that now with the railway lines.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:33:17-1:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:17):**  I don't know how that's going to go.  I want to thank you so much for your time, Matt, to come on.  I mean, you have a lot to do.  
**[1:33:23-1:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:23):**  Like you need to spend another four or five hours today looking at your land, which is  very important.  I'm not making a joke here.  
**[1:33:28-1:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:28):**  I'm not being cynical.  It's fundamental because that observation leads to, I mean, the results and the flavor  we just heard about, but I want to thank you so much for coming on.  
**[1:33:38-1:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:38):**  I don't think it's going to be the last time.  I really enjoyed it.  It's probably the longest interview we ever did, but with really good reasons and so many  
**[1:33:45-1:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:45):**  other rabbit holes to unpack.  So I want to thank you for now.  I will put all the links below of your social media for people to follow, to come and visit,  
**[1:33:53-1:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:33:53):**  to see what's possible and to taste what's possible and to understand and to listen to  farmers because they are the only ones that really know the land.  So thank you so much for your time, for all that you do and for taking the time to come  
**[1:34:05-1:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:34:05):**  here and share your story.  Thank you.  I'll stop there.

**[1:34:40-1:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:34:40):**  Thanks again and see you next time.  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:35:01-1:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:01):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:35:11-1:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:11):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:35:23-1:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:23):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[1:35:31-1:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:31):**  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  
**[1:35:34-1:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:34):**  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  
**[1:35:40-1:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:40):**  For whom is this course?  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[1:35:48-1:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:35:48):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[1:36:01-1:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:01):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[1:36:13-1:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:13):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:36:18-1:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:18):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[1:36:32-1:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:32):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[1:36:37-1:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:37):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:36:51-1:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:36:51):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in and what kind of co investors you could find or what kind of investors you could  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:37:03-1:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:03):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:37:16-1:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:16):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:37:22-1:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:22):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:37:32-1:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/matt-chatfield#t=1:37:32):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.  Click on the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

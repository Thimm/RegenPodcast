### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Thu, 02 May 2019 17:00:09)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:00):**  You're listening to the summary of the interview. For a link to the full-length episode, please check the description below.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:08):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture â€“ Investing as if the Planet Mattered,  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:13):**  a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:18):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems,  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:24):**  while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:27):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration? Because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:32):**  have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:36):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers,  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:40):**  start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:45):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job,  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:49):**  and I will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:53):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews,  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:00:57):**  there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:01):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:06):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:11):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you, and if you have the means,  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:14):**  I invite you to support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:17):**  For more information, please find a link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:23):**  And now, without further ado, the interview. Enjoy!  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:27):**  I'm here today with Paul McMahon, co-founder and managing partner of SLM Partners,  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:32):**  an asset manager that acquires and manages rural land on behalf of institutional investors  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:37):**  to scale up regenerative ecological farming and forestry systems.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:41):**  He's also the writer of a white paper called The Investment Case for Ecological Farming.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:47):**  I think we see land at the centre of a number of overlapping and increasing important environmental issues.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:01:57):**  For example, climate change, land is going to be a huge role as a carbon sink  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:04):**  as we try and get greenhouse gas emissions out of the atmosphere,  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:08):**  whether that's in soil, whether that's in trees or biomass on the land.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:13):**  But terrestrial carbon we think has got a huge future of the next 50 to 100 years.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:19):**  We think those systems are proven on a small scale, and there's some fantastic case studies out there.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:25):**  Often driven just by innovative farmers, not necessarily coming out of academia or research institutes,  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:30):**  but by really innovative farmers trying out new ideas and creating things from the ground up.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:35):**  So they're proven at a small scale, but they need to be scaled up.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:39):**  And that's what we think investment capital can play a role.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:44):**  I think there's two things changing at the moment.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:46):**  What we're seeing is that those, let's say what were previously externalities,  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:50):**  which people got away with for free, are increasingly being priced and regulated.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:02:55):**  And so actually farmers and land managers are being forced by policy and regulation  
**[0:03:01-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:01):**  to actually take into account the impacts they're having on carbon, on water, on soils and biodiversity.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:08):**  I think a second, and maybe even a more powerful driver, a more immediate driver,  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:12):**  is shifting consumer demands and consumer trends.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:19):**  Farming is the ultimate biological business.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:24):**  It's the fundamental business of farming is taking sunlight, energy, combining with water  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:32):**  and the properties and minerals of the soils to grow things.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:37):**  Organic coffee systems, which are able to out-produce in terms of yield actually,  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:42):**  conventional coffee systems during droughts.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:45):**  There's been a number of case studies in 2012 in the US where that was the case with corn production.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:49):**  There's also diversity. I think you find that those more ecological farms tend to be growing a broader mix of crops  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:56):**  or raising a broader mix of animals.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:03:59):**  So you're getting some resilience just from diversity, which really reflects and mimics nature.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:06):**  We founded SM Partners in 2009 and our vision is building an asset management firm  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:14):**  that wholly focuses on sustainable regenerative agriculture and forestry.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:20):**  So we take a real assets approach.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:22):**  So we're in most cases looking to acquire land or invest in land as a primary asset  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:27):**  and then look to really accelerate the shift in management from, let's say,  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:33):**  more conventional unsustainable practices to more sustainable regenerative practices.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:38):**  What we've done so far, we've raised an Australian Beef Cattle Fund in 2012.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:44):**  We have about 100 million Australian dollars in equity and debt in that structure in Australia.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:50):**  But we're raising an Irish Forestry Fund at the moment.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:53):**  The idea there is we're looking to acquire existing mid-rotation commercial forests in Ireland.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:04:58):**  We want to transform where possible to a more sustainable type of forest management called continuous cover forestry,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:04):**  where you never clear the forest, you maintain forest cover, you selectively harvest,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:09):**  you get a more natural, diverse forest.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:13):**  I mean, that's the other key thing.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:14):**  You know, there's lots of people running around, former bankers with presentations and spreadsheets,  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:21):**  and that's kind of easy to do, but the hard part is actually making it happen on the ground.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:25):**  And for that, you need great technical people, great operational managers,  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:29):**  people who've got dirt under fingernails and really have done this work.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:32):**  A huge amount of education has to be done just to get people comfortable with the dynamic of the sector.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:40):**  But actually the third thing that's happening on the investment side is,  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:42):**  you know, if you look at where money flowed into agriculture over the last five to ten years,  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:45):**  it mostly went into quite passive buying and lease strategies.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:49):**  But that's started to run out of steam now because land prices are actually coming down,  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:53):**  they're correcting, cash rents are coming down.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:56):**  It's a pretty tough time actually in conventional agriculture,  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:05:58):**  if you're making money, and at the same time, you look at what's happening in organic space,  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:02):**  in these more, let's say, consumer-friendly markets.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:06):**  That's where all the growth is, that's where premiums are available,  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:08):**  that's where people are still making good money.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:13):**  What for you is the number one overlooked risk there?  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:16):**  Well, I think it depends on your timeframe.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:19):**  I think if you look over a very long timeframe, I think the degradation of the market,  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:25):**  over a very long timeframe, I think the degradation of natural assets,  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:29):**  in particular soil degradation, I think it's a huge issue for humankind over the next century.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:35):**  It's one of these slow-run problems that you can ignore,  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:39):**  especially if you're in a very fertile area with very deep, top soils.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:45):**  But eventually it will come back to bite you.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:47):**  I think though in the immediate term, the bigger risk of the more conventional systems  
**[0:06:51-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:51):**  is the changing consumer.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:06:53):**  The consumer, whether you agree or disagree, wants something different from what conventional ag is selling.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:01):**  What are the two most important barriers you see for the sector to reach its potential?  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:06):**  I think that's probably the biggest challenge still,  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:08):**  just to be able to show evidence and data that this can be done at a scale.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:13):**  I think the second is just a more general one for the sector,  
**[0:07:16-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:16):**  in that just agriculture of any type is still unfamiliar territory for most investors.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:23):**  It tends to be capital intensive, the returns are lower,  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:27):**  you're not going to get your VC, private equity, 20-25% net IRRs, it's just not possible.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:34):**  But at the same time you've got downside protection because you have real assets,  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:38):**  you have land, you have biological assets.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:40):**  What are the barriers you see for the sector to reach its potential?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:43):**  When you look at the barrier of scaling the few pioneers or the pioneers with a few hundred  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:50):**  or a few thousand hectares to a fund like S&M, like you're managing now,  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:55):**  how did you overcome that barrier to investors?  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:07:59):**  We took investors to farms in Australia using the same ideas, having done it with great success.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:05):**  So they could see it in their own eyes, yeah, this has been done on let's say 10,000, 20,000 acres,  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:11):**  so there's no reason it can't be done on 100,000 or 500,000 acres.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:15):**  What is the future of investment in agriculture?  
**[0:08:18-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:18):**  If you look at our philosophy is around rural land and harnessing sunlight, water and soils to grow things.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:28):**  What is the future of investment in agriculture?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:31):**  It's interesting, financial investors like to think in asset classes,  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:37):**  but nature doesn't think that way, you know, the boundaries of fluid and everything is interlinked.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:42):**  So we actually, we can see a time in the future where we may even try and combine some agriculture and forestry strategies together.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:48):**  What advice would you give to smart investors who want to get into the regenerative agriculture space?  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:51):**  If you could give advice to smart investors that want to get into the regenerative agriculture space,  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:08:57):**  what would be your number one advice?  
**[0:09:00-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:00):**  Only invest with teams who have real farmers on board, you know, it's too easy to come up and sell a concept,  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:12):**  but farming is actually really hard, it's actually hard managing a fund for example.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:17):**  So unless you've got people on a team who've actually done this and have made mistakes and have the scars to show it, then I'd be a little bit wary.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2016/12/26/paul-mcmahon/#t=0:09:25):**  What advice would you give to smart investors who want to get into the regenerative agriculture space?

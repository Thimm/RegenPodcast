**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:14):**  Welcome to a very special episode of the podcast where we check in with Paul Bupkenberg, Agroforestry  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:18):**  Investment Lead Europe at Ecosia, the search engine that plants trees.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:23):**  We had him on the show two years ago and it's definitely time for a check in.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:28):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:33):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:37):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:42):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:48):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:50):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:54):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small,  
**[0:00:59-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:59):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:06):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:10):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:13):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:17):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:30-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:30):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:31):**  Hi Paul, welcome back to the show.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:34):**  Last time we talked you shared more details on your quest to find farmers wanting to implement  
**[0:01:39-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:39):**  financed by Ecosia agroforestry systems in Europe.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:42):**  Can you share what has happened with that competition?  
**[0:01:45-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:45):**  Hi Koen and thank you very much for this opportunity to catch up and give an update on what happened  
**[0:01:53-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:53):**  with Ecosia's fund and incubator for regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:59):**  It has been a very interesting year.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:02:02):**  In early 2020 no one really spoke about agroforestry and then in January 21 even the German Bundestag  
**[0:02:11-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:02:11):**  had a debate on the urgent need to support the implementation of perennial agricultural  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:02:17):**  systems like agroforestry.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:02:21):**  So we clearly see that it's a more and more established message that trees and agroforestry  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:02:28):**  are key to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:02:32):**  And the question really is now how to make this happen and how to drive this transition  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:02:35):**  accelerated.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:02:39):**  We find that money is still an issue in the sense that the high upfront costs need to  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:02:46):**  be financed and many farmers are not willing to either take the risk or don't even have  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:02:51):**  access to that amount of money upfront for a farming system that they are establishing  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:02:57):**  basically from scratch.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:00):**  Banks are still hesitant although we do see a lot of movement there as well.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:06):**  We see that for example in Germany the GLS, a sustainable bank, is making an offer now.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:15):**  They provide 100 million euros for regenerative agriculture at a very interesting interest  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:22):**  rate.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:23):**  We hope that more banks will follow that example.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:28):**  But we generally do find that the interest from farmers into our offer has also increased.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:34):**  We funded four projects in 2020 and three alone in the first quarter of 2021.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:41):**  And the pipeline is continuously growing and filling.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:47):**  So actually we changed the mode in a way that we are not really a competition.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:53):**  It's not a competition anymore.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:55):**  Projects can approach us at any time and especially early on in their planning phase to try to  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:04:03):**  discover early on whether this could be a match and then we can also help them, guide  
**[0:04:07-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:04:07):**  them, connect them with experts or other projects and basically jointly develop successful projects.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:04:20):**  The offer that we are making to farmers is still the same.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:04:23):**  It's a financial partnership to fund the transition to or the creation of a farm that will honor  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:04:30):**  regenerative practices and build production systems that really regenerate soil and healthy  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:04:37):**  ecosystems.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:04:38):**  That said, we also want to stimulate market viable production systems.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:04:43):**  So farms that can produce food for local, national or even global markets and survive  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:04:52):**  in those markets from the profit that they generate.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:04:56):**  And this is why we provide loans and not grants to farms.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:02):**  However, it's not a normal typical mortgage type of loan.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:09):**  It's a loan with a subordination clause.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:12):**  So it doesn't stand in the way of other primary lenders like banks.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:16):**  We don't get any securities for the loan.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:21):**  And therefore, it's nearly as risky as equity capital for us, which is why we expect a fairly  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:29):**  high interest rate of six to seven percent.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:32):**  That's higher than most bank loans, but mitigated by the flexibilities that we build into the  
**[0:05:37-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:37):**  loan contract.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:38):**  For example, there are no early payback fines.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:41):**  There can be an interest free extension period if there are financial difficulties at the  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:49):**  farm, etc.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:51):**  What has been the key two lessons you've learned in the past two years?  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:55):**  I would say the first thing is that when you are afraid of being in a niche market, like  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:00):**  agroforestry is clearly a niche within regenerative agriculture, which in itself is a niche in  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:07):**  agriculture as a whole, then you might quickly doubt and get scared whether you're really  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:13):**  on the right track, whether this is the right thing, whether it will really have an impact,  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:18):**  etc.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:19):**  We were quite certain of that somehow, even though we weren't experts in the field at  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:24):**  the beginning.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:26):**  And now we have discovered that it turns out to be a really important lever.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:34):**  People did follow and sort of picked this topic up, not just because of us, but in parallel,  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:41):**  there have been many other activities, many other initiatives and companies and experts  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:47):**  that have voiced their opinion.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:49):**  Lots of things happened.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:50):**  The learning really is like when you're convinced that you're on the right track, follow on  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:56):**  and go for it.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:58):**  The second one I would say is that more specifically now to the funding and investment theme of  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:04):**  agroforestry.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:05):**  I believe that the long term funding for agroforestry isn't really the problem.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:11):**  There will be banks, there will be subsidies, etc.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:16):**  But immediately now, the change needs a catalyzer.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:22):**  That means we have to share the risks that are involved in setting up these kind of systems.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:28):**  That is necessary to get started quickly.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:31):**  And of course, there should be a kind of sharing of the risks.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:35):**  We are willing to do that in exchange for a share of the profits later in the form of  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:39):**  these subordinated loans that I explained.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:42):**  But beyond that, I think it's really a call out for other investors that want to put money  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:47):**  into space.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:49):**  We believe now is the right moment.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:51):**  Go for it.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:52):**  It's a very promising field.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:54):**  And the acceleration of this transition is really worthwhile.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:00):**  And now we are in the summer of 2021.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:02):**  What will you be focusing on with Ecosia for the next few years?  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:06):**  The focus for the rest of this year and next year will really be to scale our activity  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:12):**  up.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:13):**  So far, we have invested somewhere a bit over half a million euros.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:18):**  We would like to invest 3 to 5 million euros next year in 2022.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:25):**  And do this with an alliance of like minded companies, foundations and other impact investors.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:31):**  So this is really also a call for others to join us in this new alliance.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:38):**  We want to jointly catalyze the transition towards regenerative agriculture in Europe  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:43):**  through these type of on farm investments.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:46):**  Our focus thereby lies on farms that will incorporate trees into farming.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:51):**  One specific criteria is that at least 30% of the revenue of those farms should come  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:56):**  from trees in 15 years.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:59):**  And so we're looking for farms like that.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:01):**  We are simultaneously increasing the pipeline of projects that we are speaking with.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:06):**  And this now is on a continuous basis.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:11):**  So looking forward to hearing both from farmers as well as interested investors.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:19):**  And what are you looking for from the audience of the podcast?  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:22):**  What kind of investors should reach out and learn more and join you?  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:26):**  So the criteria for becoming part of this new financial alliance for regenerative agriculture  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:32):**  in Europe are that we should share the same values.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:36):**  So your business model should certainly be 100% deforestation free.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:41):**  And ideally, you already have a track record for in climate action.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:46):**  And then you should be willing to contribute at least 500,000 euros next year in form of  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:53):**  loan or grant.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:56):**  And of course, be willing to share the risks with the farmer like we have been doing in  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:02):**  exchange for a moderate rate of return.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:07):**  For any details, of course, I'm very happy to get in touch and look forward to hearing  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:13):**  from any investors that are interested in joining us and get on board very quickly.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:18):**  Lastly, I just want to reemphasize the reasons why I really encourage you to join us in this  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:27):**  investment into regenerative agriculture and notably agroforestry.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:32):**  So first of all, you will be planting trees with a purpose, not just reforestation, but  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:39):**  you're really restoring degraded farmland.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:42):**  And thereby, you will demonstrate climate positive farming at scale.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:46):**  This is our aim.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:47):**  We want to show that agriculture can actually become a carbon sink instead of being a major  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:52):**  carbon emitter.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:54):**  So hereby, we are working jointly then on one of the largest levers for changing our  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:00):**  climate.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:01):**  The third reason I would say is really the potential for catalyzing this transition and  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:08):**  unlocking other funding.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:10):**  So if you, we have found that when we are coming on board of projects, the banks and  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:17):**  other funders are a lot more willing to take the same risks and then be on board.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:22):**  So you could play the same role with us.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:25):**  And then lastly, we are of course not only providing the financing, we also want to create  
**[0:11:30-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:30):**  a network of these kinds of farms, really multiplicate their impact, making them lighthouse  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:39):**  projects in Europe and beyond, and tell their story to spur the widespread adoption of these  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:45):**  farming systems.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:46):**  So really, the impact goes much beyond just financing.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:49):**  And we hope that this is of interest for you and for others that you may speak to about  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:56):**  this.

**[0:13:06-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:13:06):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:13:08):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:13:12):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:13:17):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:13:59):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:02):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office

**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:15):**  No.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:16):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:19):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:22):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:27):**  different means.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:28):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:14:33-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:33):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:36):**  Thank you.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:37):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:14:38-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:38):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:45):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:47):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:52):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:57):**  invest in, what kind of co investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:02):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:04):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:08):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:12):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:17):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:18):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:20):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:23):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:26):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:28):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:33):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

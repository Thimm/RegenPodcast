### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2021-09-24)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:14):**  Welcome to a very special episode of the podcast where we check in with Paul Bupkenberg, Agroforestry  Investment Lead Europe at Ecosia, the search engine that plants trees.  We had him on the show two years ago and it's definitely time for a check in.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:28):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:42):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:54-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:00:54):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small,  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:10-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:10):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:21):**  For more information on the different tiers, benefits and how to become a member check  gumroad.com slash investing region egg or find the link below.  Thank you.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:31):**  Hi Paul, welcome back to the show.  Last time we talked you shared more details on your quest to find farmers wanting to implement  financed by Ecosia agroforestry systems in Europe.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:42):**  Can you share what has happened with that competition?  Hi Koen and thank you very much for this opportunity to catch up and give an update on what happened  with Ecosia's fund and incubator for regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:01:59):**  It has been a very interesting year.  In early 2020 no one really spoke about agroforestry and then in January 21 even the German Bundestag  had a debate on the urgent need to support the implementation of perennial agricultural  
**[0:02:17-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:02:17):**  systems like agroforestry.  So we clearly see that it's a more and more established message that trees and agroforestry  are key to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:02:32):**  And the question really is now how to make this happen and how to drive this transition  accelerated.  We find that money is still an issue in the sense that the high upfront costs need to  
**[0:02:46-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:02:46):**  be financed and many farmers are not willing to either take the risk or don't even have  access to that amount of money upfront for a farming system that they are establishing  basically from scratch.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:00):**  Banks are still hesitant although we do see a lot of movement there as well.  We see that for example in Germany the GLS, a sustainable bank, is making an offer now.  They provide 100 million euros for regenerative agriculture at a very interesting interest  
**[0:03:22-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:22):**  rate.  We hope that more banks will follow that example.  But we generally do find that the interest from farmers into our offer has also increased.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:34):**  We funded four projects in 2020 and three alone in the first quarter of 2021.  And the pipeline is continuously growing and filling.  So actually we changed the mode in a way that we are not really a competition.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:03:53):**  It's not a competition anymore.  Projects can approach us at any time and especially early on in their planning phase to try to  discover early on whether this could be a match and then we can also help them, guide  
**[0:04:07-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:04:07):**  them, connect them with experts or other projects and basically jointly develop successful projects.  The offer that we are making to farmers is still the same.  It's a financial partnership to fund the transition to or the creation of a farm that will honor  
**[0:04:30-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:04:30):**  regenerative practices and build production systems that really regenerate soil and healthy  ecosystems.  That said, we also want to stimulate market viable production systems.  
**[0:04:43-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:04:43):**  So farms that can produce food for local, national or even global markets and survive  in those markets from the profit that they generate.  And this is why we provide loans and not grants to farms.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:02):**  However, it's not a normal typical mortgage type of loan.  It's a loan with a subordination clause.  So it doesn't stand in the way of other primary lenders like banks.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:16):**  We don't get any securities for the loan.  And therefore, it's nearly as risky as equity capital for us, which is why we expect a fairly  high interest rate of six to seven percent.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:32):**  That's higher than most bank loans, but mitigated by the flexibilities that we build into the  loan contract.  For example, there are no early payback fines.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:41):**  There can be an interest free extension period if there are financial difficulties at the  farm, etc.  What has been the key two lessons you've learned in the past two years?  
**[0:05:55-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:05:55):**  I would say the first thing is that when you are afraid of being in a niche market, like  agroforestry is clearly a niche within regenerative agriculture, which in itself is a niche in  agriculture as a whole, then you might quickly doubt and get scared whether you're really  
**[0:06:13-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:13):**  on the right track, whether this is the right thing, whether it will really have an impact,  etc.  We were quite certain of that somehow, even though we weren't experts in the field at  
**[0:06:24-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:24):**  the beginning.  And now we have discovered that it turns out to be a really important lever.  People did follow and sort of picked this topic up, not just because of us, but in parallel,  
**[0:06:41-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:41):**  there have been many other activities, many other initiatives and companies and experts  that have voiced their opinion.  Lots of things happened.  
**[0:06:50-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:06:50):**  The learning really is like when you're convinced that you're on the right track, follow on  and go for it.  The second one I would say is that more specifically now to the funding and investment theme of  
**[0:07:04-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:04):**  agroforestry.  I believe that the long term funding for agroforestry isn't really the problem.  There will be banks, there will be subsidies, etc.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:16):**  But immediately now, the change needs a catalyzer.  That means we have to share the risks that are involved in setting up these kind of systems.  That is necessary to get started quickly.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:31):**  And of course, there should be a kind of sharing of the risks.  We are willing to do that in exchange for a share of the profits later in the form of  these subordinated loans that I explained.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:42):**  But beyond that, I think it's really a call out for other investors that want to put money  into space.  We believe now is the right moment.  
**[0:07:51-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:07:51):**  Go for it.  It's a very promising field.  And the acceleration of this transition is really worthwhile.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:00):**  And now we are in the summer of 2021.  What will you be focusing on with Ecosia for the next few years?  The focus for the rest of this year and next year will really be to scale our activity  
**[0:08:12-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:12):**  up.  So far, we have invested somewhere a bit over half a million euros.  We would like to invest 3 to 5 million euros next year in 2022.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:25):**  And do this with an alliance of like minded companies, foundations and other impact investors.  So this is really also a call for others to join us in this new alliance.  We want to jointly catalyze the transition towards regenerative agriculture in Europe  
**[0:08:43-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:43):**  through these type of on farm investments.  Our focus thereby lies on farms that will incorporate trees into farming.  One specific criteria is that at least 30% of the revenue of those farms should come  
**[0:08:56-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:08:56):**  from trees in 15 years.  And so we're looking for farms like that.  We are simultaneously increasing the pipeline of projects that we are speaking with.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:06):**  And this now is on a continuous basis.  So looking forward to hearing both from farmers as well as interested investors.  And what are you looking for from the audience of the podcast?  
**[0:09:22-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:22):**  What kind of investors should reach out and learn more and join you?  So the criteria for becoming part of this new financial alliance for regenerative agriculture  in Europe are that we should share the same values.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:36):**  So your business model should certainly be 100% deforestation free.  And ideally, you already have a track record for in climate action.  And then you should be willing to contribute at least 500,000 euros next year in form of  
**[0:09:53-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:09:53):**  loan or grant.  And of course, be willing to share the risks with the farmer like we have been doing in  exchange for a moderate rate of return.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:07):**  For any details, of course, I'm very happy to get in touch and look forward to hearing  from any investors that are interested in joining us and get on board very quickly.  Lastly, I just want to reemphasize the reasons why I really encourage you to join us in this  
**[0:10:27-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:27):**  investment into regenerative agriculture and notably agroforestry.  So first of all, you will be planting trees with a purpose, not just reforestation, but  you're really restoring degraded farmland.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:42):**  And thereby, you will demonstrate climate positive farming at scale.  This is our aim.  We want to show that agriculture can actually become a carbon sink instead of being a major  
**[0:10:52-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:10:52):**  carbon emitter.  So hereby, we are working jointly then on one of the largest levers for changing our  climate.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:01):**  The third reason I would say is really the potential for catalyzing this transition and  unlocking other funding.  So if you, we have found that when we are coming on board of projects, the banks and  
**[0:11:17-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:17):**  other funders are a lot more willing to take the same risks and then be on board.  So you could play the same role with us.  And then lastly, we are of course not only providing the financing, we also want to create  
**[0:11:30-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:30):**  a network of these kinds of farms, really multiplicate their impact, making them lighthouse  projects in Europe and beyond, and tell their story to spur the widespread adoption of these  farming systems.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:46):**  So really, the impact goes much beyond just financing.  And we hope that this is of interest for you and for others that you may speak to about  this.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:11:57):**  Thank you so much for that update, Paul.  And for anyone interested in connecting with Paul and learning more, please email at regenerate  at Ecosia.org.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:12:07):**  Regenerate at Ecosia.org.  If you found the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast valuable, there  are a few simple ways you can use to support it.

**[0:12:43-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:12:43):**  below.  Thank you so much and see you at the next podcast.  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:12:58-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:12:58):**  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:13:08-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:13:08):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:13:22):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:13:29):**  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:13:34):**  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  
**[0:13:38-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:13:38):**  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course you, the soil builders and investors in this space?  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[0:13:49-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:13:49):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:02):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:14):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:19):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:28):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:37):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:14:47-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:14:47):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:15:02-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:02):**  find if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:12):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:20):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:15:28-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-woebkenberg-2#t=0:15:28):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

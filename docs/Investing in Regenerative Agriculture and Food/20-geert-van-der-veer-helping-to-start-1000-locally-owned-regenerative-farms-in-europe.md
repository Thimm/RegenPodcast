**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:00:20):**  planet mattered.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:00:21):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:00:31):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:00:44):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:00:54):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:00:58):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:01:02):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:01:05):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:01:10):**  depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:01:15):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:01:19):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:01:24):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:01:35):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:01:36):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:01:40):**  I'm Kuma Sayan, your host.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:01:42):**  In these interviews, I'm talking to people who are scaling up the regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:01:46):**  sector, either by increasing the inflow of investment capital or by scaling up the enterprises  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:01:52):**  on and in the ground.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:01:53):**  And by doing so, exploring what it means to be an impact investor in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:01:59):**  Why my focus on regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:02:01):**  Because the roots of so many of the issues we're facing in the world today can be found  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:02:05):**  in agriculture.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:02:06):**  From droughts, migrant flows, obesity, social issues, water wars, climate change, hunger,  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:02:12):**  they all have a connection to how we treat the land, grow food and what we eat.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:02:16):**  I hope you will enjoy this interview as much as I did making it.

**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:02:32):**  a movement in the Netherlands where they bought a farm with 200 families and hired a farmer  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:02:37):**  to farm for them in the most sustainable regenerative way possible.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:02:41):**  We're going to talk about how he started, why he started this movement, and more importantly,  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:02:46):**  what he's trying to do to scale it and to get to 100 farms in the Netherlands and to  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:02:50):**  a few thousand in Europe.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:02:52):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:02:53):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:02:56):**  I'm Koen van Sijn, your host, and in the podcast of today, I'm joined by Geert van der Weer,  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:01):**  co-founder of Heerenbuhlen.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:02):**  Welcome Geert.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:03):**  Thank you.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:04):**  Hi Koen.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:05):**  So to start with a personal question, and of course we would love to know more about  
**[0:03:09-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:09):**  Heerenbuhlen and the movement.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:11):**  But what made you start Heerenbuhlen and why regenerative agriculture in the Netherlands  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:16):**  for you?  
**[0:03:17-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:17):**  Yeah, it has to do with my experience during my, since I was working with the Farmers Association  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:27):**  here in the Netherlands.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:30):**  I've been working there between 1998 and 2003, and I discovered a lot about the way we are  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:39):**  producing our food here in the Netherlands, of course, in Europe and in the world.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:45):**  And I saw that things should be different done than it's been doing today.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:53):**  So that's why I was trying to do it from, I was trying to change from within the organization.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:03:59):**  And that took me so much effort that I thought that I want to do it differently.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:04:06):**  So I started, I left the association, started to work on projects on short chain relationships  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:04:14):**  between consumers and farmers.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:04:18):**  And I did that for a couple of years.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:04:20):**  And also I there discovered that starting with the producer is not always the same as  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:04:28):**  starting to work with an entrepreneur.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:04:31):**  And so I discovered that it's difficult for farmers to change their business model, to  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:04:39):**  change their way of thinking.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:04:42):**  It's also a cultural thing within the agricultural sector that I thought, okay, I've seen a lot  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:04:47):**  and I've done a lot.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:04:49):**  And right now I have to do one thing.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:04:51):**  I have to develop my own farm concept that shows the world, shows the Netherlands that  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:04:59):**  it's possible to do it differently.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:05:02):**  And the best way of having some impact is to do it.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:05:06):**  So then we started the Heere Burren movement as we speak of it right now.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:05:12):**  And well, we opened the first farm in 2015 in Vauxhall.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:05:22):**  And right now we are having about 20 farms as in families who want their own farm here  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:05:30):**  in the Netherlands.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:05:32):**  We are helping to build that farm.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:05:34):**  So it's more than just one spot at the moment.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:05:37):**  Yeah, you definitely from the beginning, and I remember the conversations we had a number  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:05:42):**  of years ago, that there are many examples where people get together and maybe start  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:05:47):**  farming or buy something, et cetera.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:05:49):**  But what really for me set you apart is that from the beginning you said this needs to  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:05:54):**  scale.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:05:55):**  We need to get to 100, we need to get 200, we need to go to 2000 farms that are operating  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:05:59):**  in this way.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:06:00):**  So from the beginning you really designed it with scale in place.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:06:04):**  And at the moment there's one really operative and there are about 20 that are in different  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:06:08):**  phases of getting there.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:06:11):**  But can you explain, let's take the one that is already operational.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:06:16):**  What is it?  
**[0:06:17-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:06:17):**  What's the scale?  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:06:18):**  What is so different from the neighbors that are still farming traditionally?  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:06:22):**  And how does it work?  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:06:24):**  Okay, the basic principles are quite simple.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:06:28):**  There are 200 households representing 500 people.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:06:33):**  These households, they became a member of our cooperative and they did an investment,  
**[0:06:41-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:06:41):**  an investment of 2000 euros per household and they brought also together, so 400,000  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:06:52):**  euros.  
**[0:06:53-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:06:53):**  And that amount of money we spent on, we invested in the first costs we had to make to start  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:07:01):**  the farm.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:07:02):**  And the farm is a farm which produces a lot of different products.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:07:07):**  So we have fruits, vegetables, we have meat as in chicken, pork, beef.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:07:16):**  We have eggs and we try to, within these different product groups, we try to have as much as  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:07:24):**  possible variety.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:07:27):**  So we have 12 different apples, eight different pears, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:07:36):**  And what the members do, they bring on an annual base all the costs together by the  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:07:47):**  contribution they pay to the cooperative.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:07:50):**  So each mouth in a household, in a family, each mouth pays about 10 euros each week and  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:07:57):**  gets in return for that, he gets the products from our farm.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:01):**  And compared to the supermarket, that's a lot cheaper.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:05):**  So you get more products by paying the company.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:09):**  And a lot nicer and healthier products, I imagine.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:11):**  Exactly.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:12):**  A lot more sustainable from a mixed farm that doesn't hardly exist anywhere else.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:16):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:18):**  And so to summarize, all the members of the cooperative pay at the beginning a fixed fee  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:24):**  of 2000 and then after that they also guarantee for a number of years their take off, their  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:30):**  off take.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:31):**  So they pay a contribution of 10 euros a week per person.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:36):**  And for that they get, if I remember correctly, about 60% of their daily needs when the farm  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:40):**  is fully operational and fully producing these 12 types of apples, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:46):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:47):**  And to be more concrete, they are committed for three years in the beginning.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:53):**  And of course they can stay a member as long as they want.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:08:57):**  But in the beginning they are committed for three years and that makes it possible to  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:09:03):**  start this farm because in the beginning it's not up and running completely.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:09:08):**  So that commitment we needed.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:09:11):**  But it seems to be not even a problem to find people who are this committed to the concept.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:09:21):**  So it has to do with two things.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:09:26):**  It has to do with the community feeling, being together, starting together, something that  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:09:32):**  makes the world a little bit better in your own benefit in this concrete.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:09:38):**  And the other thing is that we are trying to improve our techniques in the way we produce  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:09:48):**  the food.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:09:49):**  So it has to do with the way we keep our livestock.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:09:52):**  It has to do with the way we are producing vegetables, et cetera.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:09:56):**  A lot of permaculture influence on our farm.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:10:01):**  Agroecology is the main principle we work with.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:10:07):**  And so on, you can say that it's not only nice and fun to be a member of the cooperative,  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:10:14):**  but you can also have a lot of influence on the way we are producing.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:10:18):**  So actually the entrepreneurship of this farm is not on the level of the farmer, but it's  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:10:24):**  on the level of the cooperative and every member is the entrepreneur of our farm.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:10:28):**  And in terms of you mentioned him or her now very briefly, who is the farmer?  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:10:34):**  Who's doing the farming?  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:10:35):**  Are those the people in the cooperative or is it somebody else doing the day to day work  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:10:41):**  professional?  
**[0:10:42-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:10:42):**  The essential part of the concept is that we wanted to be independent of voluntary activities.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:10:54):**  So there is a farmer who is getting his money from the cooperative.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:11:00):**  A fixed salary, which is nice for, I mean, it's very different for many farmers.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:11:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:11:05):**  He's not having the risks or the benefits of the farm.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:11:09):**  That's what the cooperative members together have.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:11:13):**  So he gets a salary to be concrete.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:11:17):**  So that's one farmer.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:11:20):**  And he has on a yearly basis, there is an amount of money he can spend on hiring more  
**[0:11:26-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:11:26):**  people to work on the farm if necessary, because there are a lot of members who want to work  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:11:34):**  on the farm.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:11:36):**  There is no necessary element that they have to come to work on the farm.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:11:43):**  But if they do, of course it saves costs, which benefits the cooperative.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:11:47):**  Exactly.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:11:48):**  So basically the daily work has been, it's the farmer who is doing the daily work.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:11:55):**  And he's the manager of the farm and he can hire more people or he gets his people from  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:12:03):**  the community working on the farm.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:12:05):**  And to describe, to dive a moment into the farm itself, can you describe the size?  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:12:10):**  Did you buy the land first of all?  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:12:12):**  Did you rent it?  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:12:13):**  Or at least what can we see on that farm that's so different from the neighbors?  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:12:18):**  Okay.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:12:19):**  We have a farm of 20 hectares and we didn't buy it because that has to do with the philosophy  
**[0:12:27-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:12:27):**  of our movement regarding to ownership of land.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:12:35):**  We did not want to have someone or an organization to have an exit.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:12:42):**  So for the benefit of the person or the organization, I will sell my land.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:12:48):**  No, that's not possible.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:12:51):**  Altogether at this moment we rent the land from a foundation.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:12:57):**  That's a long-term rent I can hear.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:12:59):**  Exactly.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:00):**  So that's the way we are gaining our land.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:03):**  And like I said, it's 20 hectares.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:07):**  And well, you can see, you can see 3,000 trees in the orchard.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:12):**  You can see 30 pigs and about 25 cows for our meat.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:21):**  And we have 1,000 chickens.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:23):**  We have four and a half hectares with vegetables, etc., etc.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:28):**  So that's…  
**[0:13:29-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:29):**  And you're rotating them in a system, right, in a process to make sure the different parts  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:37):**  of the farm benefit from each other and not in silos.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:40):**  Yeah, not just rotating them.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:41):**  We're also mixing them.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:42):**  So our chickens are working for us in our orchard and our pigs are doing some work on  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:49):**  the field.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:50):**  For example, after we have harvested our potatoes.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:55):**  So there are always more…  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:13:59):**  We do not need to invest in machinery or something.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:03):**  Our animals can do a lot of work.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:06):**  Symbiotic relationships, yeah.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:07):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:08):**  And animals, I mean, like Joe Salatin says, they don't break down.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:13):**  They don't need fossil fuel, but at the end of the day you can still sell them.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:16):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:17):**  And even stronger, it's also something Joe Salatin said.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:21):**  They grow on it.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:23):**  So you also are saving some costs on the other hand on the feed you need for the animals.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:32):**  So there is just a win-win.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:35):**  And in terms of this specific farm in Bockstau, where are you at?  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:41):**  You started in 2015.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:42):**  What would you say…  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:44):**  What point have you reached now and what are the next steps?  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:46):**  Okay, right now what you see is that the main principle of the concept are really…  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:53):**  are really working right now.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:54):**  So we have our members.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:57):**  We're seeking 200 households.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:14:59):**  At the moment we have 144 households committed to our concept and we're still growing.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:15:06):**  So that's going very well.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:15:10):**  And in this second full season we are producing right now, we start learning a lot and gaining  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:15:18):**  a lot of insights for the next season.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:15:22):**  We have a lot of luck this year with the climate, with the weather.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:15:26):**  Everything is growing really beautiful.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:15:28):**  So we are being complimented for the quality we are delivering at the moment.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:15:33):**  Because last year was horrible.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:15:34):**  I remember a drought and water and everything went against you basically.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:15:42):**  So some people said last year, they said when you're surviving this year, you can beat  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:15:47):**  every other year that's coming.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:15:49):**  And this year we are very lucky, really.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:15:53):**  So we are very lucky this year.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:15:55):**  And so that makes the people happy, literally.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:15:59):**  They have invested in the concept because they believe that.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:16:02):**  They had a hard year last year and right now it's a beautiful year and they have beautiful  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:16:06):**  products.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:16:07):**  So that gives us the space in time and thinking of how to improve our techniques, how to…  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:16:18):**  Me myself, I'm studying on nature.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:16:22):**  What can nature bring for us?  
**[0:16:25-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:16:25):**  Insights or techniques we can scale, we can transform into a technique of producing.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:16:35):**  And can these techniques be scaled to a level of a complete farm?  
**[0:16:40-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:16:40):**  So the time I have right now I spend watching YouTube videos, reading books, following courses  
**[0:16:50-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:16:50):**  myself to improve all the knowledge we need to restore the ecosystem of our farm.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:16:58):**  And the vision we are developing in the last couple of months is more and more that we  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:17:08):**  have the responsibility for the complete ecosystem and yes, this ecosystem is also producing  
**[0:17:14-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:17:14):**  our food.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:17:15):**  And that gives us a lot of thinking of how we can improve biodiversity, what can we do  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:17:23):**  more for our soil as we are doing already.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:17:27):**  What can we plant in terms of wood, like trees on the farm, more as we have already.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:17:34):**  And that makes us… well because the production is going so well we can think about these  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:17:41):**  themes and that gives a lot of hope for next year.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:17:44):**  Yeah, no, I can imagine.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:17:47):**  And let's talk a bit about scalability and replicating this model.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:17:53):**  How did you start with that?  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:17:55):**  I mean it's one thing to start in one place but it's another thing, a whole completely  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:17:59):**  different thing to from the beginning actually have scalability in mind.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:18:04):**  Can you explain a bit what's your vision there and what's happening actually now  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:18:08):**  on the ground with all these other cities and villages that are somewhere in the process  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:18:12):**  of setting up their own Heerenboren?  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:18:14):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:18:15):**  Well, what's happening here in the Netherlands and I think I see that all over Europe and  
**[0:18:20-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:18:20):**  other places in the world as well, there are a lot of entrepreneurs working on their own  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:18:26):**  concept and how big they are as an entrepreneur.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:18:29):**  The problem here at least in my surroundings is that there are always forces, forces you  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:18:37):**  need as in politicians or government or etc.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:18:42):**  They are telling you constantly, okay, what you're doing is nice but it's not the  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:18:47):**  solution for all the crisis we are dealing with within the sector at the moment.  
**[0:18:53-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:18:53):**  So it's a kind of the point of, okay, nice try but you're not a serious, I can't  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:19:00):**  take you seriously.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:19:01):**  So when we started thinking of this foreign concept, we had one of the principles we based  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:19:08):**  the concept on was it should be scalable.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:19:11):**  The moment that we would start to scale the model is at the moment that came a lot quicker  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:19:18):**  as we thought.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:19:19):**  But from beginning on, we were telling all the people this is not just one farm.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:19:26):**  We are going to work on at least 100 farms in the Netherlands and therefore when we started  
**[0:19:33-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:19:33):**  putting that out, there were a lot of organizations and foundations, government but also our universities  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:19:46):**  who said, okay, this is probably the first concept in the Netherlands that is trying  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:19:53):**  not to stick to a farm for own benefit.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:19:57):**  This is a movement and with this movement, we can maybe, we can make a change and I hope  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:20:05):**  we are an example for a lot of that we can have that function to be an example for a  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:20:09):**  lot of other people who say that they want to scale their movement themselves because  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:20:15):**  it's not our movement that can make the change.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:20:18):**  We should go work together with a lot of other people who have the energy and the time to  
**[0:20:24-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:20:24):**  build their own movement but I think we are having the benefits of being one of the first,  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:20:32):**  if not the first movement in the Netherlands that is working on scale from the beginning  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:20:37):**  and that brought a lot of attention from the beginning on even when there was not even  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:20:44):**  a farm in Baxl.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:20:46):**  So just putting out the wish to grow was enough to get all the attention and then when you  
**[0:20:52-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:20:52):**  get the attention, there is a kind of snowball effect we engaged and that made the whole  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:21:01):**  thing move.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:21:04):**  As in, we started in Baxl with also little things as a website and Facebook and Twitter  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:21:11):**  and well you are sending out a message but the other hand is that you will be found and  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:21:18):**  we were found by a lot of people also in the cities and other places in the Netherlands  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:21:24):**  and they started asking us please give us a farm nearby as well and that was in the  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:21:31):**  face that we didn't even have one farm up and running.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:21:35):**  And what was your response to that when somebody asked I am living in Amsterdam or I am living  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:21:39):**  in Utrecht which is not just for the people listening, not super close to Baxl and I would  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:21:44):**  say I want something like this near my place.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:21:48):**  What was your answer?  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:21:49):**  What is your answer when somebody asks that?  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:21:51):**  First of all the answer is follow us.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:21:54):**  Join the movement and if you want to have your own farm nearby you have to work yourself  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:21:59):**  because we are not like a traditional McDonald's franchisee, copy paste.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:22:05):**  Exactly.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:22:06):**  So it's not our goal to create 100 farms.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:22:11):**  We are preparing our organisation to service people who want to have their own farm.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:22:20):**  So there is always energy needed from local people and if there is no energy locally we  
**[0:22:26-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:22:26):**  are not going to introduce ourselves over there.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:22:29):**  So the main thing we respond to people is okay you want to have a farm start up your  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:22:37):**  community.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:22:38):**  Start to find soul mates who also want their farm in our concept and when you have at least  
**[0:22:45-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:22:45):**  actually we are already starting to work together from a group of six households locally who  
**[0:22:55-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:22:55):**  said we are really going to pull on this project, we are going to find these people, our soul  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:23:03):**  mates who also want to have their own farm.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:23:06):**  And when we have found these four of the six families we are starting to make a little  
**[0:23:12-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:23:12):**  contract and from that contract on they have the responsibility to find at least 150 households,  
**[0:23:21-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:23:21):**  members, families and on a parallel we are trying to find the ground, the soil, the land.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:23:29):**  That's what we are trying to find at that moment in a parallel from seeking on the families  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:23:36):**  and we are also trying to find the farmer because we have one challenge here and that  
**[0:23:43-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:23:43):**  is that our farmers are always specialized in producing one product and on a farm they  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:23:51):**  have to do about everything that exists in that way.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:23:55):**  So that are two parallel things we are starting up and every time they reach a new milestone  
**[0:24:06-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:24:06):**  like the first milestone is at 100 families we can also take another step and that step  
**[0:24:16-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:24:16):**  involves investment from our side in money and energy and time so every time they reach  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:24:23):**  a milestone we can have another step towards making the farm concrete.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:24:28):**  And as a customer or as a part of a cooperative does the food get to my place?  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:24:35):**  I know I don't have to work on the farm if I don't want to, there is no obligation if  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:24:39):**  I want to of course I can do my gym and work out and help the farmer.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:24:43):**  If I don't the food will survive.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:24:46):**  Can I choose my products?  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:24:47):**  What if I don't like something?  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:24:49):**  How does that concretely work?  
**[0:24:52-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:24:52):**  Okay what they do, what we do is once or twice a year we are sending out this form to our  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:25:02):**  members on which they can apply what they want that the farm should produce the next  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:25:08):**  season.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:25:09):**  So we are really getting back so about 80% of the forms we get in return and we are analyzing  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:25:18):**  these forms on the products for the next season.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:25:24):**  The main reason we do that is for the vegetables.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:25:27):**  So that's the way people get influence on what the farm produces and we are also organizing  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:25:33):**  little events for people to test the taste of our food.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:25:38):**  So that has more to do with the meat production.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:25:42):**  Is this the kind of meat I want to eat?  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:25:45):**  Is this the right species of pigs or chicken we want to have here on the farm?  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:25:51):**  And in that way we are gathering the information out of the community depending on what we  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:25:57):**  are producing and how we are producing it and that gives us an average production.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:26:03):**  So we are not producing on a personal level your wishes but we have an average production  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:26:08):**  all over these community members and when the products are ready it's up to the community  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:26:15):**  what they want.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:26:16):**  Do you want to come to the farm and pick up your food or do you want us to arrange pickup  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:26:22):**  points or do you want us to arrange the delivery at home?  
**[0:26:26-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:26:26):**  At this moment 95% of our members they want to come on a weekly base to their own farm.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:26:33):**  They say you are not going to keep me away from my farm.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:26:37):**  We want to come over here and we want to get our products and what we do concrete is that  
**[0:26:44-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:26:44):**  people at a Saturday or a Wednesday afternoon they come on the farm and they really pick  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:26:53):**  the vegetables from the field while they are still growing.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:26:56):**  So we are cutting them off in front of our members.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:26:59):**  We are harvesting our products in front of them.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:27:02):**  So they really choose what they want to eat.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:27:05):**  But just to be clear if they don't want that in the budget in the plan it can still arrive  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:27:09):**  at home.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:27:10):**  There is for the percentage of people that don't want to go every Saturday to their farm  
**[0:27:15-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:27:15):**  the food is delivered at a pickup point or how does that work if I am a more lazy farmer?  
**[0:27:21-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:27:21):**  At the moment the cooperative decided that while 95% of the people wanted to get to the  
**[0:27:29-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:27:29):**  farm every week and pick it up so in Boxhall we did not do any preparations for other delivery  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:27:38):**  services.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:27:39):**  So right now at the moment you can feel the conversation is restarted.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:27:46):**  With new people joining there might be less involved so there will be a solution decided  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:27:53):**  by the cooperative to make sure the food gets to the right places.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:27:57):**  And the people who are already members for a longer period I experience that it is quite  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:28:06):**  nice for a couple of first times to get to a new place and a new concept and what we  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:28:13):**  see right now is that convenience is also something we have to deal with.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:28:17):**  Yeah sure I can imagine.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:28:20):**  And I want to be very conscious of your time.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:28:23):**  I want to end with a question which I might open a can of worms but what is the role or  
**[0:28:27-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:28:27):**  could be the role if there is of impact investing of investment money into a system like this?  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:28:35):**  It seems to be very focused on local energy, local resources because people actually put  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:28:40):**  the money upfront to rent the land and to prepare the land for their farm.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:28:45):**  Is there a role you see in the scalability in the businesses on top of maybe a hundred  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:28:51):**  farms what do you see as if there is a group of smart impact investors hopefully listen  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:28:55):**  to this podcast and they say I want to do something in this.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:28:58):**  Not just being a customer of course you should start your own farm locally close to your  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:29:02):**  city but what can be their role with their investment amount.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:29:07):**  I see two main different goals.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:29:11):**  First of all there is a goal we have to buy the land sometimes.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:29:17):**  We are not buying the land locally with the cooperative but on the central organization  
**[0:29:24-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:29:24):**  here in Nederland we are on the market to buy land so we can hire it to the cooperative  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:29:33):**  and sometimes when there is no foundation we can hire the land from locally we are on  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:29:39):**  the market so we are looking for people to help with that.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:29:44):**  So that's the first thing really buy land with us.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:29:49):**  That's the first thing and more basic and more necessary on the short term is that this  
**[0:29:57-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:29:57):**  movement is growing so fast that we feel our organization is having problems to keep up  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:30:06):**  with the growth coming from the outside.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:30:09):**  Keeping up with the demand yeah that's a good problem to have.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:30:12):**  Yeah exactly it's luxury but you can see that our break even from the national staff organization  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:30:20):**  is about is between the 2025 farms.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:30:24):**  Because the break even in this case means because yes the farms are cooperative.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:30:28):**  Heerenbuden itself is a company and every farm pays a certain amount every year for  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:30:34):**  all the assistance for the setting up etc to Heerenbuden so you can make yourself sustainable  
**[0:30:39-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:30:39):**  with you mentioned 25 farms right?  
**[0:30:41-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:30:41):**  Exactly and up till that moment we need funding to get our organization up and running.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:30:48):**  So that's also part we are very curious to find some investors to join us not just for  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:30:56):**  making a lot of profit because that's not the goal of our organization.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:31:01):**  Our profits are more than just financially we are actually producing happy people and  
**[0:31:10-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:31:10):**  a lot of biodiversity and nice food and yes we also have a financial chapter and I'd like  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:31:17):**  to invite people to come and watch in that chapter what we can do together.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:31:23):**  Well a lot of money is needed to get this as big as I think it can be but from 2025  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:31:28):**  farms there is a point that it will be self-sustaining.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:31:33):**  Sustaining and propelling yeah it will start growing.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:31:35):**  I think also because you have a lot of interest from abroad I can imagine I mean a lot of  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:31:40):**  similar situations are happening in the UK in France the agriculture is under the traditional  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:31:46):**  chemical agriculture is under pressure.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:31:48):**  We have a lot of journalists and other interested people from a lot of countries in Europe at  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:31:53):**  the moment and therefore I think but yeah it is our concept so I hope I may say that  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:32:00):**  I think this deserves embraced and put a little bit further as it is right now and we cannot  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:32:07):**  do that alone we need a lot of other people other than I think not only just in the Netherlands.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:32:12):**  I want to thank you so much Geert for your time and sharing your lessons learned in setting  
**[0:32:17-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/#t=0:32:17):**  up this new concept this different concept in terms of agriculture consumers and prosumers

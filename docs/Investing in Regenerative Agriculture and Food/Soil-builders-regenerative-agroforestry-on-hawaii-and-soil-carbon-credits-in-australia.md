### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Thu, 13 May 2021 17:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:14):**  Welcome to Soil Builders, a series where we follow who is building soils at scale.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:19):**  This is an experiment, so please share any feedback.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:22):**  Why this show Soil Builders?  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:23):**  I believe that most change in regenerative agriculture and food will come from and is  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:27):**  coming from entrepreneurs building ways to regenerate soil at scale.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:32):**  I call these Soil Builders.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:34):**  Soil Builders are entrepreneurial farmers, ag tech companies, investment funds, food  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:38):**  startups, new seed cooperatives, teams within food companies, robot startups, investment  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:42):**  vehicles etc. etc. etc.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:45):**  All regenerating soil beyond their own farm gate and with more than their own money.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:49):**  This series allows the community of the podcast, which is you, full of funders, investors and  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:54):**  fellow soil builders to follow their progress, their challenges and their breakthroughs.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:00:58):**  I hope you enjoy it and please reach out with any comments, feedback and ideas.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:03):**  Welcome to the Soil Builders series where we follow who is rebuilding soils at scale.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:07):**  Today we hear from Brett Glover of Impact Ag Partners on the deal of Microsoft with  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:11):**  an Australian rancher to purchase many, many soil carbon credits.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:15):**  But first up, what does regenerative agriculture look like with breadfruit on Hawaii?  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:19):**  I found it super interesting how Dana and her team are building a crucial puzzle piece  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:24):**  of the regenerative future of Hawaii.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:26):**  Hi, Dana.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:27):**  Welcome to the podcast.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:29):**  Could you please introduce yourself and what brought you to produce breadfruit on Hawaii?  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:33):**  My name is Dana Shapiro and I'm the general manager of the Hawaii Ubu Cooperative, a social  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:39):**  enterprise owned by about 100 small family farmers in Hawaii.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:45):**  Most of our members are located on Hawaii Island.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:47):**  We also have a few in East Maui.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:50):**  I came to work with breadfruit in Hawaii through a friend who introduced me to the crop about  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:01:57):**  10 years ago when she recruited me to serve as the volunteer coordinator for the Breadfruit  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:02:02):**  Festival in South Kona in 2011.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:02:07):**  I was amazed by the fruit's versatility in particular.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:02:11):**  I entered the cooking contest and was really excited to play around with cooking the crop  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:02:15):**  in all of its maturity stages, which are very different one from the next.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:02:20):**  And I really fell in love with it and actually met my husband the following year festival.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:02:28):**  We were both on the planning committee.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:02:30):**  And from then on, it's sort of been a breadfruit journey.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:02:34):**  Why is breadfruit so interesting from a food perspective?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:02:37):**  From a food perspective, breadfruit is really exciting for a number of reasons.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:02:43):**  First of all, it's one of the only staple foods on Earth that grows on a tree.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:02:48):**  And that means that by growing breadfruit, we are effectively reforesting the planet  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:02:54):**  and actively fighting climate change.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:02:57):**  It is a carbon negative crop, which cannot be said for most starches.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:02):**  It's also extremely versatile from a culinary perspective.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:05):**  It can be eaten at all stages of its maturity from when the fruit is a baby spiky ball on  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:10):**  the tree, at which point it sort of tastes like an artichoke heart into the stage where  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:15):**  it matures and the starches develop and it becomes very potato-like.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:20):**  And then the starches convert into sugars and it becomes sweet like a dessert, initially  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:23):**  like a pumpkin, and then like a ripe banana.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:27):**  And at every single stage, it's delicious.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:30):**  It can be prepared in all sorts of innovative ways.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:33):**  And it's very nutritious as well at every stage.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:36):**  It's a complex carbohydrate.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:38):**  It's naturally gluten-free.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:40):**  It's very high in fiber.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:42):**  Flour made from breadfruit is, of course, naturally gluten-free and contains three times  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:46):**  the amount of fiber as conventional all-purpose wheat flour does.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:50):**  It has a lot of micronutrients, really high in vitamin A and beta carotene, the nutrients  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:56):**  that are good for your eyes and your vision.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:03:58):**  Also really high in vitamin C. It has more vitamin C than oranges and more vitamin A than  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:04):**  carrots.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:05):**  So it's just an amazing, nutritious, versatile, and delicious food.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:10):**  And why from a farming slash farmers perspective?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:13):**  From a farming perspective, breadfruit is extremely resilient and abundant.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:18):**  Because it's a tree, it's relatively resilient to climate change as well as just normal weather  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:23):**  extreme events.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:24):**  If you think about most annual crops, they can be wiped out by a drought or conversely  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:29):**  a big storm.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:31):**  Trees usually do not.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:33):**  And breadfruit trees in particular are really adaptable.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:36):**  They grow in almost every microclimate in Hawaii below about 2000 feet elevation.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:41):**  They need relatively little inputs in terms of irrigation and fertilizer once they're  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:46):**  established.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:47):**  And they're just incredibly resilient.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:49):**  In fact, it's hard to kill a breadfruit tree.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:52):**  You can basically stump it and the tree will regrow.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:55):**  They're also prolific producers.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:04:57):**  A single tree can on average yield about 300 pounds of food a year.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:03):**  And that's split across two to three fruitings over the course of its season.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:07):**  But some trees will produce twice that much or even more.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:11):**  And so it's a really wonderful crop.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:13):**  It's also very beautiful.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:15):**  It works well in diversified agroforestry systems where the trees can act as windbreaks  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:20):**  or alley crops or hedgerows.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:23):**  They can be lined throughout riparian buffers to protect the watershed.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:28):**  And they create a beautiful canopy with these huge leaves that create shade for wildlife  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:34):**  and recreational spaces for humans.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:37):**  And they're very pleasing to look at.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:39):**  They're just an absolutely beautiful crop to incorporate onto a diversified farm.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:43):**  How has COVID affected your company?  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:46):**  COVID-19 had a catastrophic impact initially on the co-op.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:52):**  Our sales halted in March 2020 when the lockdown started and schools closed.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:05:59):**  About 95% of our sales went to food service outlets pre-pandemic, including about 50%  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:06:05):**  to Hawaii public schools.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:06:07):**  And public schools still haven't resumed in-person learning.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:06:11):**  And they have pretty much stopped buying local.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:06:14):**  We hope that it will come back the next school year.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:06:17):**  But in reality, it might be a few years before our public schools start buying significant  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:06:22):**  amounts of local food again, mostly because of the budget restrictions resulting from  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:06:26):**  COVID.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:06:28):**  On the food service side, we are seeing hotels and restaurants coming back online slowly.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:06:34):**  But really what COVID did is it forced us to take a hard look at our market base and  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:06:41):**  realize how at risk we were by putting all of our ulu, so to speak, all of our breadfruit  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:06:46):**  in one basket with regard to the food service sector.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:06:50):**  And in response, we've worked really hard to diversify our market base.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:06:56):**  So we launched our online store in April of 2020, which has grown pretty quickly.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:03):**  We brought in a little over $50,000 from the online store between July and February, which  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:09):**  now accounts for about 8% of our sales.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:13):**  And we hope to grow that further.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:15):**  We've also been working with local grocery stores to get more of our products into the  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:19):**  retail supply chain.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:21):**  And another target market for us is manufacturers.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:24):**  So we're looking at becoming an ingredient supplier for more Hawaii-based and non-Hawaii-based  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:28):**  manufacturers with our minimally processed breadfruit and related products.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:34):**  So all in all, COVID has not had a lasting negative impact on us, but it definitely shook  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:40):**  us up a lot.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:41):**  It had a temporary, really harsh negative impact, and hopefully in the longer term it  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:46):**  will make us stronger as an organization by really intentionally building a more diversified  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:51):**  market base.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:52):**  What are you going to be mostly working on in 2021?  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:07:57):**  2021 is going to be a year of continuing to focus on diversifying our market, getting  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:08:03):**  more products into the retail supply chain, hopefully finding a great distribution partner  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:08:08):**  locally for retail stores, and completing a few big milestones.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:08:14):**  One is that we are currently in the middle of our, hopefully, last big capital campaign.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:08:19):**  We are currently raising $1.2 million, which will, we think, take us the rest of the way  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:08:25):**  toward developing a profitable co-op business.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:08:28):**  We are working with a number of local foundations and enterprises, organizations, and individuals  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:08:33):**  on that.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:08:34):**  So we have a real diversified capital stack, including preferred stock from non-co-op members,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:08:41):**  PRI loans, community loans, and a small amount of grant revenue that we're seeking.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:08:46):**  We also are working with the Department of Agriculture to plan our facility upgrades.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:08:52):**  Our flagship facility is a state-owned ag hub, and we received about $1.2 million from  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:08:59):**  the state in fiscal year 2019 to make really sorely needed upgrades that will bring the  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:09:05):**  facility up to code and expand it to handle our projected increasing volumes of fruit,  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:09:12):**  up to 2 million pounds a year in total, which will be broken into about 1.5 million pounds  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:09:17):**  of ulu over the next 10 years, and 500,000 pounds of other crops, primarily other local  
**[0:09:24-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:09:24):**  staple foods.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:09:26):**  And so we're going to be making progress toward that.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:09:29):**  We're currently in an environmental assessment process, and we're going to be making some  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:09:34):**  key sort of equipment purchases that we're able to make on our own, thanks to grant funds  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:09:39):**  and some low-interest loans.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:09:41):**  And all of those things combined should increase our efficiency, bring down our cost of production,  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:09:46):**  and ultimately make our products more competitive against imported staple foods.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:09:51):**  So there's a lot of exciting work to do, a few key hires that we're looking at, including  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:09:56):**  a sales position and a co-op member coordinator position that we're really excited about as  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:10:01):**  well.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:10:02):**  So we have a lot of work to do, and we're looking forward to it.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:10:05):**  And what is your main focus over the mid and long term?  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:10:08):**  Our main focus over the mid to longer term is broken into three categories.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:10:14):**  The first is on the supply side, working to help increase our farmers' capacity.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:10:19):**  This is one of the biggest hurdles for Hawaii agriculture in general and something that  
**[0:10:24-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:10:24):**  we feel really strongly about at the co-op.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:10:27):**  Most of Hawaii's farmers are small scale farmers.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:10:30):**  That means they have less than $250,000 a year in gross revenues.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:10:35):**  The average farm size is less than 10 acres.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:10:39):**  And our farmers need a lot of support in order to professionalize and collectively to scale  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:10:45):**  and adopt best practices that will help ensure the success of their own farm operations.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:10:51):**  Technical stuff like fertilizing regiments and pruning regiments and more nuanced stuff  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:10:57):**  like how to plan out the design of new plantings, for example.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:03):**  And so we're working with the University of Hawaii College of Tropical Agriculture and  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:07):**  Human Resources, CTAHR, with Dr. Noah Lincoln, who's also my husband.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:12):**  He's sort of leading the agronomic research side for Hawaii's breadfruit industry.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:16):**  And Hawaii doesn't have a dedicated extension agent for this crop.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:20):**  So we actually find that the co-op is acting as an arm of the extension service.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:26):**  Ideally there would be a whole extension branch dedicated to indigenous crops and breadfruit  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:31):**  in particular, but there isn't.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:33):**  So we do find ourselves trying to fill that gap in partnership with Noah and others at  
**[0:11:38-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:38):**  the university.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:40):**  So the supply side is a huge one for us and our whole success as a co-op really hinges  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:45):**  on the success of our farmers.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:47):**  So their success is ours as well.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:50):**  And the second category is manufacturing.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:53):**  So basically increasing our manufacturing capacity through infrastructure and equipment  
**[0:11:58-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:11:58):**  upgrades and gearing up our whole manufacturing team to just get better and more professional  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:06):**  in the processing side, the quality, standardization, and food safety.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:11):**  So that's another big hurdle as well.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:14):**  And the final side is our sales and marketing.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:16):**  So really where is all this supply of Ulu going?  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:19):**  Within 10 years we're going to have 1.5 million pounds.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:23):**  Currently we have 100,000 pounds.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:25):**  So it's a 15-fold increase over a 10-year period.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:29):**  And our sales and marketing work is really a consumer education campaign, a public education  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:35):**  campaign about all the benefits of eating Ulu and other indigenous starches here in  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:39):**  Hawaii, what you can do with it, how to use it, and really just continuing to build interest  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:46):**  and awareness around these indigenous starches.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:49):**  We see that momentum growing.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:51):**  We have really strong partnerships among chefs.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:54):**  We work with a wonderful nonprofit called the Chef Hui, and we've established an Ulu  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:12:59):**  ambassador program in partnership with them where we bring in professional chefs as well  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:13:04):**  as really cutting-edge schools and even hospitals, state institutions that are showcasing Ulu  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:13:10):**  in all its glory and educating the public about this wonderful crop.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:13:14):**  And so working to highlight them and their work and finding additional ways to partner  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:13:18):**  is one of the key strategies we have for the sales and marketing component.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:13:22):**  And we also have a really strong youth education piece, which is sort of like a really, really  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:13:28):**  long-term sales and marketing approach.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:13:32):**  We've been working in partnership with the Hawaii Farm to School Hui and the University  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:13:36):**  of Hawaii College of Education for the last three going on three and a half years.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:13:42):**  And in April of 2021, next month, we're going to be launching our Ulu education toolkit  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:13:47):**  as an online database, which is a project, again, we've been working on for a number  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:13:51):**  of years with a lot of wonderful teachers and other educational organizations contributing  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:13:57):**  resources and testing out what we put together, and we're finally putting the final version  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:03):**  as a searchable online database for teachers to use and parents and students on their own.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:09):**  So it's basically a repository of educational resources about breadfruit geared for a wide  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:15):**  range of ages, all the way from preschool through adult education, and it's searchable  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:21):**  by curricular standard grade level resource type.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:25):**  And we're really excited for that to launch and just continuing to spread the good word  
**[0:14:29-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:29):**  about this amazing crop, breadfruit.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:31):**  And up next, we hear Bert, who has been on the show a few times before to share more  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:35):**  on their part of the soil carbon credit deal with Microsoft and where he sees this space  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:41):**  going.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:42):**  Hey, Bert, great to have you back on the show.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:44):**  Can you tell us more about this new, very exciting project where you have sold soil  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:48):**  carbon credits to Microsoft?  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:50):**  Thanks, Cohen.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:51):**  Great to be in contact again.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:53):**  I guess Impact Ag Partners has, as you know, for quite some time been practicing regenerative  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:14:59):**  agriculture across the assets it manages.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:15:03):**  We've been on behalf of offshore investors, investing and deploying capital into Australia  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:15:09):**  for over 10 years now and through separate managed accounts have been practicing the  
**[0:15:14-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:15:14):**  sorts of agriculture that we think helps build the wealth of soil in our ecosystems.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:15:21):**  And I guess this sale of the carbon credits is one way of monetizing the ecosystem services  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:15:28):**  we have created.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:15:30):**  This transaction and the first transaction, which is one of three transactions that has  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:15:36):**  occurred is off a farm we purchased back in 2008.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:15:40):**  And we've always been very diligent in our capture of data and utilization of data to  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:15:47):**  make better business decisions.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:15:49):**  And so this farm has, we knew we had strong carbon performance off this farm.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:15:54):**  We've been tracking that right back since 2010.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:15:58):**  And so when the opportunity came around for us to meet the guys at the Regen Network out  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:16:04):**  of the US in San Francisco, we started to talk to them about how we could monetize our  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:16:09):**  carbon.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:16:10):**  And between us, we came up with a system that the Regen Network have now called a Carbon  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:16:15):**  Plus Grassland Credit, which is a voluntary credit.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:16:19):**  And so what we've been able to do and the methodology the Regen Network have created  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:16:24):**  is based on utilization of satellite data, but correlating that with physical soil tests  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:16:30):**  that we've had.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:16:31):**  So in this example, we've used those soil tests and that data to create the Grasslands  
**[0:16:39-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:16:39):**  Credit based on, and what we call vintage carbon.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:16:42):**  So it's carbon that we have sequestered in the past, right back to 2017.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:16:48):**  And so that's taken from physical soil samples, GPS located every year.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:16:54):**  And that's what's been able to deliver the measurements and results around the carbon.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:00):**  So off this one farm, we sold 43,000 tons of CO2 equivalent.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:06):**  And the buyer, as you say, has been Microsoft in this instance.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:11):**  Of course, in the methodology, there is some discounting, which takes into account any  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:16):**  accuracy issues.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:17):**  It's delivered a net profit per hectare of $62, which is equivalent to about $153 an  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:24):**  acre.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:25):**  And the good thing about this is we can credit on an annual basis moving forward as it's  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:32):**  a voluntary credit in a private market.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:35):**  We can credit every 12 months if we so wish, as opposed to some regulated markets where  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:39):**  you cannot do that.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:40):**  So it's been great for delivering value for our investors.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:45):**  And we look to continue to do this and build more carbon.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:49):**  I mean, it's adding about anywhere between 50 to 100 basis points per annum to our annual  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:55):**  cash yield.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:56):**  And that starts to be significant.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:17:58):**  And so it's just another way of creating not only value for the investors, but building  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:03):**  up that soil carbon and delivering ecosystem services and holding more moisture in our  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:09):**  soils and building the health of our landscapes.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:11):**  Hi, Bert, thank you so much for sharing that story.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:15):**  And congratulations.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:16):**  Where do you see this going?  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:18):**  As you mentioned, this is the voluntary market.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:20):**  We actually had Christian of Regen Network on the show, I'll make sure to share the link  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:25):**  below with the interview.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:27):**  But where do you see this market going?  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:28):**  How big could this be?  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:30):**  And most importantly, what does it mean for landowners like you or stewards and farmers  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:36):**  in general?  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:37):**  Well, this could be really big.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:38):**  We know that in Australia, down to about three meters in our soil profile, there's approximately  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:45):**  2300 billion tons of carbon.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:48):**  And that's again, down to three meters.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:50):**  And if you take into account that Australia is really only about 5.2% of the global land  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:18:58):**  mass, the amount of carbon stocks globally, that's an amazingly huge number.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:19:04):**  So the opportunity is great.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:19:06):**  And I guess we feel now that this first transaction, and all these three transactions are a demonstration  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:19:15):**  of the start of a market whereby you've got a willing seller and a willing buyer comfortable  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:19:20):**  with the discounts, comfortable with pricing, terms and conditions, and it's been third  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:19:26):**  party verified through auditors.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:19:28):**  So you've got, in our mind, a marketplace.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:19:32):**  And I think what you're going to see moving forward is the refinement of new methods will  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:19:37):**  come to bear.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:19:38):**  There'll be refinement of existing methods and the co-benefits.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:19:42):**  So when I'm talking about the co-benefits, again, I'm talking about improvements in other  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:19:46):**  ecosystem services, such as some water quality and biodiversity and vegetation aspects, along  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:19:53):**  with things such as animal welfare benefits and or conservation.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:19:58):**  So you're going to see different products come to market.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:20:01):**  And I think what's going to help drive a lot of this is private capital.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:20:05):**  I think what we're seeing interest in, in addition to the purchase of credits, is the  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:20:12):**  interest from private investors wanting to participate in some form in these markets.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:20:17):**  And as we know that private investment will generally lead public investment and these  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:20:24):**  private markets for voluntary credits, we know will probably get a lot more traction  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:20:30):**  and really catalyze the industry ahead of the regulated markets.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:20:34):**  Because the regulated markets, as you know, they have to go through so many pieces of  
**[0:20:39-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:20:39):**  legislation change and there's red tape associated with the robustness around the public markets.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:20:48):**  So these public markets or regulated markets, they're going to become...  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:20:52):**  They will get there, they'll get refined.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:20:55):**  It's just going to take time.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:20:56):**  And I think what we'll see is that the private markets and with voluntary buyers will start  
**[0:21:02-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:21:02):**  to take carbon credits from national accounts and that carbon will get sold out of existing  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:21:10):**  jurisdictions purely because of these private transactions.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:21:15):**  So we're quite bullish about where this could go.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:21:18):**  And I think what we will find is that for farmers, it means they're all of a sudden  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:21:24):**  going to have another potential revenue stream.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:21:27):**  All of a sudden, when they're making decisions inside their farm gate about whether they're  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:21:33):**  going to sow corn or soy and how they're going to manage livestock, they're going to be thinking  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:21:38):**  about what's the impact I'm having on also my carbon stocks.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:21:43):**  And they're also going to be thinking about is my practice is going to add to my carbon  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:21:47):**  stocks or am I going to be depleting my carbon stocks?  
**[0:21:50-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:21:50):**  And how am I going to manage my soil so that I'm more resilient in drier times as we see  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:21:58):**  climate variability associated with climate change?  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:22:01):**  How is that going to impact my practices on farm?  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:22:06):**  And I think the other big thing is that we're going to see farmers really start to think  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:22:12):**  about the use of data.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:22:13):**  We're going to see farmers get a lot more discipline around how they capture data.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:22:20):**  And so if we take into account soil sampling so that farms can participate in soil carbon  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:22:27):**  credit markets, the disciplines are really around the timing of when you're taking soil  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:22:32):**  samples, the location of where you're taking them, the method you're using and the depth  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:22:38):**  and all of those things, and also the consistency in testing through the lab results and making  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:22:44):**  sure you're using accredited labs to do that.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:22:48):**  I think some of the benefits out of this for farmers is with all this private capital coming  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:22:54):**  in, you're going to see a lot of different products come to market whereby a farmer can  
**[0:22:59-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:22:59):**  choose a carbon product that really suits their risk appetite, really suits their stage  
**[0:23:05-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:23:05):**  of life.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:23:07):**  If you're a 30-year-old farmer, you can probably take some greater risk in terms of which carbon  
**[0:23:15-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:23:15):**  market you participate in.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:23:17):**  But if you're a 65-year-old farmer, you may like to participate in markets that carry  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:23:22):**  less risk but still offer that liquidity, may not be as much potential carbon upside.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:23:28):**  So your annual returns may only be 20 basis points instead of 50 basis points or 100 basis  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:23:35):**  points.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:23:36):**  So I think there's definitely going to be opportunities.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:23:40):**  One thing we're seeing from the demand side is just the appetite to get close to where  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:23:45):**  the carbon is getting generated.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:23:47):**  So the appetite we're seeing at the moment is from multiple different sources.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:23:53):**  But the common theme is that those buyers want to get closer to the generation of the  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:23:59):**  carbon, one understand the story, and one understand how the farmer has produced the  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:24:04):**  carbon and the practices that they have been utilising across their farm.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:24:09):**  And so if farmers are open to capturing data, open to discussions about how the transactions  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:24:17):**  can happen, open to looking at different products, I think farmers are going to end up with multiple  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:24:23):**  markets just like they do at the moment with their other commodities.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:24:27):**  If they start treating carbon as another commodity, they're going to have plenty of markets to  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:24:32):**  participate in.

**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:25:18):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:25:22):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:25:26):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:25:30):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:25:32):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:25:36):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:25:41):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:25:46):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?

**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:26:26):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:26:29):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:26:33):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:26:38):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:26:40):**  No.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:26:41):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:26:43):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:26:48):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:26:53):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:26:58):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:00):**  Thank you.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:01):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:03):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:09):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:11):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:16):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:21):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:27:26-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:26):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:28):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:33):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:37):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:41):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:42):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:44):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:47):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:50):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:52):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-6/#t=0:27:58):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

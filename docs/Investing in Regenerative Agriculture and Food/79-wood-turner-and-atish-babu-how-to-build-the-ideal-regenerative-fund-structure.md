**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  How does the ideal regenerative fund structure look like?  In this interview we tackle this challenge with a regenerative agriculture fund manager,  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:00:21):**  which has raised 800 million across two funds for permanent crops in the last 6 years.  How do they think about the future and how would they structure the ideal regenerative  ag fund?  Before we get started with today's interview, an important legal message.  We are not offering investment advice.

Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  Investing as if the planet mattered.  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:01:15):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:01:33):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.

They are focused on bringing the needed scale to the regenerative food production.  Welcome Woot Turner and Atish Badu.  Hi there.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:02:27):**  Hi.  And to start with a personal question, what brings you to soil and regenerative agriculture?  Well, for me, it's a long standing belief that agriculture is an essential part of how  we live and how we live on the planet, frankly, and the need to produce food sustainably,  regeneratively, responsibly has never been greater than it is today.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:02:49):**  As populations continue to grow and pressures on our food system, pressures on our transportation  system, pressures on how we do business and how we live continue to increase, doing this  the right way is absolutely essential.  And so this for me started at a very young age and has only amplified in the last several  years.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:08):**  We obviously believe at Agriculture Capital that the role of perennial agriculture and  permanent crop agriculture in helping reduce atmospheric carbon and sequester significant  amounts of carbon in the soil and in plant material and conservation areas is a huge  opportunity and that's a big driver for us.  But obviously the most important thing if you're in the food world as we are, is the  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:32):**  connection between soil and high quality food.  If we're not spending time building soil health and creating a living soil structure, we're  going to be very unhappy with the food that we're trying to produce.  Atish, I'd love to hear your thoughts.  Yeah, I think I approach the challenge of soil health a little bit differently.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:52):**  My interests stem probably more from looking at climate change solutions.  And I started my career very much in kind of the opposite end of the spectrum, more  tech and tech finance and early in my career, I got very interested in climate change and  climate change solutions.  Very quickly, that kind of exploration led to agriculture's role in climate change.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:04:20):**  And kind of in turn, I thought one of the best ways, the most interesting ways to start  addressing climate change is affecting ag and affecting soil health and carbon sequestration  through the ag supply chain, especially starting with the soil farm.  So while everything that Wood said is incorrect in terms of the food that we want to eat and  consume and the effects on the environment, I think I would add the statement, if we want  
**[0:04:49-0:04:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:04:49):**  a food supply chain that is also more oriented to helping abate climate change issues, you  quickly get to soil health agronomy practices as two big levers of possible change.  And that's, I mean, you said, I think twice in that sentence, you quickly get to soil  health, etc.  I mean, that interest is growing, but I still see many people not making that connection.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:15):**  What triggered that connection for you, as many other people, rightfully so, go into  solar, go into distributed energy, go into, etc., etc.  What made you see soil as a carbon sink and trees as a permanent crop as a carbon sink,  etc.  Which is quite a step from technical world.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:31):**  It is indeed.  Looking kind of at root causes, right?  So if you start with carbon emissions, you very quickly get to agriculture is the second  biggest carbon emitter in the world following oil and gas.  And then when you start thinking about agriculture and how to affect change and looking at some  
**[0:05:53-0:06:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:53):**  of the primary causes, you realize a lot of the both problems and opportunities around  agricultural role in climate change has to do with soil and how we treat and manage that  soil.  And I think the thing that is missing as of yet is clear market mechanisms and signals  that tie these together.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:14):**  So it isn't necessarily obvious, but there isn't necessarily market mechanisms that put  all of these pieces together.  But therein lies a bit of a bet in terms of the long term opportunity that is ahead of  that capital.  I was just going to add that I think another way you might take this conversation is that  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:32):**  there's a lot of people that are trying to figure out how to produce as much food as  we possibly can to meet the growing needs of a growing planet.  And a lot of those solutions are landing in kind of vertical agriculture and indoor agriculture.  And I'm not going to sit here and be so parochial to assume that the only way to actually do  what we need to do is by growing fruits and nuts in the ground and building soil.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:54):**  But you'll be in the right community.  I do fundamentally believe that.  And I do think there's going to be a role for other types of food production.  Absolutely.  And I'm not denigrating those in any way at all.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:06):**  But I fundamentally believe that the core of responsible agriculture and certainly regenerative  agriculture is growing food in the soil, is a land management philosophy.  How do we expand responsible practices across as much acreage as we possibly can in food  production in order to have the biggest impact on how we manage land and the impact that  how we manage that land has on the climate, has on water resources and so on.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:32):**  So I just want to reinforce that I do believe there's something about soil that to me is  fundamental about food.  No, I agree.  And I think there's Victor Friedberg said it nicely that something I'm for sure quoting  it wrong, but something I don't see a future where we're feeding nine or 10 billion people  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:48):**  where soil isn't an important part of the solution, not meaning it's the only part.  And I strongly believe there's going to be pieces of vertically farming.  There are going to be pieces of.  But if you look at the crops we currently farm there or the crops you currently get  out of those systems, and if you look at the true input and output costs, it's still tricky.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:07):**  Let's say the least.  It's not an ideal yet.  And it might increase because we get much more efficient LEDs, et cetera, et cetera.  But if you look at the impact you want to have or we want to have in terms of climate  and water and also quantity of food, you need to think about a lot of acres or a lot of  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:22):**  hectares wherever you are.  And that means you're going to get into tree cropping means you get into broad acre farm.  You need to touch a lot of hectares to make a difference because at the end of the day,  we need to store a lot of carbon and a lot of water.  So I try to focus at least this podcast as much as possible on where the acres and hectares  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:40):**  are.  And that comes down to a small number of crops, unfortunately, but we're definitely trying  to increase the complexity of that.  So could you give a short overview?  We've mentioned agriculture capital a few times.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:52):**  I entered it.  Where are you now?  Just a short glance of what agriculture capital is at the moment.  We're talking April 2020.  So agriculture capital in 2020, we managed about 20,000 acres of citrus, blueberries,  
**[0:09:09-0:09:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:09:09):**  table grapes and hazelnuts on the west coast of the US in Australia, the Murray River,  sorry, Murray-Darling River Basin.  We're about 18,000 in the US and 2000 in Australia.  We currently have a team of 30 investment professionals.  In addition to the 30 investment professionals, we have about 400 full-time employees between  
**[0:09:35-0:09:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:09:35):**  California, Oregon, Washington state and Australia, both managing our farms as well as the associated  hacking and processing assets that we have acquired and built as part of those farm operations.  Today we are really focused on a strategy where we're growing in those crop areas, foods  that people want and increasingly are desiring more fresh and more convenient foods, doing  so in scale, vertically integrating between farm and I'll call it primary processing and  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:13):**  managing the operations in a regenerative way.  In terms of the publicly available information, in terms of our investment program, we have  $800 million US between two funds.  The first fund was a $250 million fund that was raised in 2014.  And our second fund is a $550 million US fund that was raised in 2016.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:39):**  We're currently investing out of that second fund.  I would add to that, I think it's been an interesting several years.  Ateisha and I were early parts of the team around the time that our first fund was coming  to a reality.  And we now have five plus years of track record with that first fund and then right behind  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:59):**  that with the second fund to really begin to see kind of where the biggest opportunities  for impact are for us on the regenerative side of things.  It's allowed us, I think to be, we were a little bit in the wilderness, if you will,  five or six years ago in trying to advance the conversation with a certain type of investor  about what role regenerative practices could play potentially in the performance of our  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:21):**  business over time.  And now we're beginning to see kind of what those opportunities might look like.  And not all the answers are clear, but we're seeing significant increases across the portfolio  in terms of habitat conservation and some of the indicators associated with that.  Some increases across the portfolio in soil or yaning matter as an indicator of soil health  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:40):**  and other benefits that I think are really exciting.  And we've been sort of trying to lean into the research on that to begin to sort of help  others understand that, hey, there are ecosystem services associated with a lot of these practices  that we are actively contributing to and actively beginning to see real economics that we can  begin to report on.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:00):**  And I think that's been an important part of what we're doing.  In no way is it complete, in no way is it perfect, but it is, and I think we continue  to hear this from others.  It raises the bar for the rest.  It raises the bar.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:09):**  We are pushing this conversation in a way that many others haven't been able to at this  point, and I get really excited about that.  At the same time, I may be anticipating a question you're going to ask is sort of what  are some of the barriers to getting this done?  And I think, and Atish can certainly speak to this, but I think, you know, we have the  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:26):**  ability in our two funds to manage resources from our investors, manage capital from our  investors over a short period of time, over a 10-year period of time.  Is that enough time to be able to enhance the value of our soil, enhance the value of  our landscapes through regenerative practices?  And we have this conversation as a team all the time.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:47):**  Atish and I certainly have it together, but we have it with our teammates all the time,  our colleagues all the time.  And I think the answer is no, it's not enough time.  I mean, I come from businesses that I've been with before joining this team where you're  enhancing value through sustainability, through regenerative practices over 25, 30 years of  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:04):**  engagement.  And I still fundamentally believe that.  I believe that long stewardship is absolutely essential to sort of really seeing the value  that can come from these kinds of practices.  I'll also tell you that I think it's fun and challenging to try to figure out what a more  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:18):**  short term snap I could look like.  Of course, because you were able to raise this 800 million because of the 10-year, because  of the classical fund structure, because I don't want to assume anything, but I'm imagining  many of the institutional investors wouldn't have jumped on board if you would have presented  a not typical structure because you were already atypical on the agriculture side.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:40):**  And if you look, I will definitely link it below at your impact report, it's very detailed  on soil organic matter.  Like you measure that and you report on that on most farms on a farm level, which is something  that I don't think most institutional investors have ever seen, especially a number of years  ago.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:56):**  So it's that constant dance, which I would love to dive deeper into between what you're  part of your clients, which are obviously the customers that buy your food, which are  moving at a certain pace and your other clients are the institutional investors.  Have you seen a change there in terms of as you are approaching that third fund and maybe  even with the second fund already, have you seen something that's moving there that maybe  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:20):**  gives you hope that that 10-year maybe is not a fixed thing that we might be able to  change that because I think a lot of people will be listening and are thinking, yeah,  I know it's not enough time.  Like it would be ideal.  Yeah.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:30):**  And you hit the nail on the head.  The 10-year fund structure is, well, let's say we're always trying to work to better  align duration of the assets with an investment vehicle and the structure, as well as with  how we create value from an operational standpoint.  And a lot of that value, especially if you extend the time horizon, is embedded in the  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:55):**  regenerative practices.  And when we say value, that's not only profit maximization or profit enhancement, but it's  also risk reduction.  So I think what we try to do is let's go back to first principles around the assets.  So these are trees that if managed properly on farms could have lifetimes of several decades  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:15:16):**  and in some cases, centuries.  We have certain citrus trees that we're currently managing that are over 100 years old in California.  And so when you think about that type of timeframe or timescale, the issues that really keep  you up over that period of time, hopefully not every night because there's a long, long  time to stay up.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:15:37):**  But the issues that worry folks are not what's happening with the market this year or what's  happening in terms of trade or supply chains at any particular point in time.  It's what could systematically or systemically affect the health and the productivity of  this asset for a long period of time or over that period of time.  And not surprisingly, the big concerns and risk on that front tend to be environmental  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:06):**  and tend to be social implications in the communities that we deal with.  But on the environmental front, it's things like drought, water, climate change, soil  health, soil productivity, soil health being a proxy of soil productivity or farm productivity.  And so when we started, the regenerative page in our presentation or publications to investors  was always the second to last page.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:36):**  And now it's actually the second page.  The first page is being kind of a quick intro.  And so within a period of six years, we've seen a sea change in thinking.  And I think that's happening for a couple of reasons.  So one, I think you just have, I think one, it happens to kind of align with just greater  
**[0:16:54-0:17:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:54):**  risks being realized in other portfolios, whether it be climate change, water scarcity,  labor availability.  These issues increasingly are popping up in companies reporting to investors.  Somewhat, you know, chicken and egg, right, which came first, the companies reporting  that or the people asking the companies to report on it.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:17:17):**  But increasingly, you're seeing more demands for transparency and for ESG stewardship or  regenerative stewardship, depending on the sector you're talking about, from investors,  from the consumers.  So I think that's all enhanced the call to action to try to address those issues.  And so for our investors, what they're realizing is that a lot of the operational value that  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:17:45):**  we can create in terms of regenerative opportunities have very high paybacks.  But 10 years is oftentimes not enough time for that to commercially pencil.  And if you think about assets that are going to live several decades at a minimum, why  are you underwriting for two years or five years or 10 years?  Why is that the horizon?  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:06):**  If you were to, if you were to building or a bridge or a house, you certainly wouldn't  look at the improvements or how you built it just simply due to an arbitrary two or  five or 10 year period of time.  I'm saying if you were building it yourself, right.  And so I think increasingly, investors are open minded about some type of evergreen or  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:26):**  perpetual vehicle.  We have, I think, to our credit, done a good job of talking about it since the very beginning  of AC.  Even during our first fundraise, we talked about these issues very openly.  And our perspective was a little bit counterintuitive in that.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:44):**  So you prep the mines while selling a 10 year fund?  Not only prep the mines, but we were really looking for alignments.  And we weren't necessarily afraid to lose someone if there wasn't alignment.  So we perhaps at a period where we believed we were operating in a mode of abundance and  capital wasn't the scarcity that was the limiting constraint, we were really looking and filtering  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:09):**  for investors that had a long term view and had that insight that there was this opportunity  to possibly pursue over time.  And so over six years, we've kind of cultivated a large database of investors who are least  open minded about thinking about underwriting and looking at investments with that long  term horizon.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:32):**  The key for us is still proving to them that not only is there an ESG reason for this to  be undertaken, but that there are financial incentives as well as risk management incentives  to do so.  So another way to think about it is we told them we were going to do it or we were contemplating  it and we have to win their trust and build their confidence in us.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:54):**  And I think over time, we're going to continue to push on this.  And hopefully one day we can probably not in the too distant future, we'll be able to  better align fund structure and fund duration or term with the activities that we think  are critical for value creation and better aligned to the underlying assets that make  up our investments.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:16):**  I do think that Atish said something, alluded to something in his comments there that I  want to just reinforce.  And it's really this idea of resilience.  And I do think this particular moment, Cohen, is interesting for all of us for so many reasons.  I don't want to date your podcast by talking about the fact that this is April 20th.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:36):**  We feel like we're seeing some evidence to suggest that the kind of business that we've  developed, the kind of business that we've been able to grow with the support of our  investors has built into it some degree of resilience for moments like this, where we  actually can manage a full value chain.  We can put protocols in place to ensure a high level of employee safety and food safety  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:01):**  in the context of what we're providing, not just one moment in time in the value chain  or one moment in time in the supply chain, but more of a chain of custody, if you will.  And that to me is resilience.  And if I have to think about the COVID-19 moment as an analog to anything, I can see  that same kind of resilience being part of what we're trying to do on the climate side  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:21):**  as well.  Are we investing in wild pollinator conservation?  Yes, for a variety of reasons.  One is that we believe it can enhance returns.  One is that we believe it can resonate with consumers.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:32):**  But we also believe that in a world that has more impact from climate change on pollinators,  we want to have the most resilient, most adaptive pollinators helping support our business as  we possibly can.  So I do think that there's something illustrative about this particular moment and what it says  about our resilience that I think is consistent with what we're trying to do on climate or  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:55):**  water.  I mean, the idea of trying to build up soil organic matter as a means of retaining more  water on our farms, for example, as a storage mechanism, frankly, by building our own storage  for water on our farms as a way of having access to that water when it is available.  I mean, there's a misalignment in California, for example, when there's a lot of water in  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:15):**  December and January, that's not when you need it.  We need it six or seven months later.  So building into that business, the ability to impound that water and use it later is  an important part of that.  Whether that's done through ecosystem services or done through a piece of infrastructure,  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:31):**  it's all part of the same equation.  But I just wanted to say, I think that resilience piece, from where I sit, leading our impact  efforts, I do believe that resilience is resonating broadly.  I think we're seeing, and obviously it depends when you're listening to this and where, we're  seeing the focus or suddenly the attention that we always obviously had in our bubble  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:51):**  on local food systems and on real food systems.  And suddenly the rest of the world saw for the first time in their lives an empty shelf  in a supermarket, or maybe not for the first time, obviously, again, where you live, but  at least in the, we say the Western world, people suddenly realize that eggs don't come  from the supermarket and started looking at, okay, who do I know that produces food, which  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:13):**  farms locally?  I know quite a few that have a waiting list of thousands now and that until, let's say,  February were struggling for different reasons.  Now they're struggling for other reasons.  So it's a very interesting point in terms of resilient food systems and regenerative  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:28):**  food systems.  And of course we have to see how sticky is this, but it's definitely, I think part of  this attention will stay.  There's no way we all go back to the same mindlessness buying and not understanding  where it comes from.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:40):**  And I think the risks that come with the food system are also getting pinnifully clear as  we have entered the natural world so far that we created a number, or we unleashed a number  of things that simply brought the whole world to a standstill.  So I actually wanted to go back to something you said, Atish, and you said in the maybe  not near distant future, but somewhere in the future, we'll seek a structure that fits  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:03):**  better with the impact and also the financial structure we would like to see.  I mean, if we could dream for a second, how would that look like?  What would be an ideal?  If tomorrow morning we wake up and an ideal financial structure would exist, looking at  your experience of raising 800 million and putting it to work is still in the process  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:20):**  of doing that and all your experience with investors.  What would an ideal structure for a second, what would that look like?  Yeah.  Let me maybe start just with level setting about kind of what's unique about this question  for permanent crops.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:35):**  So the name already kind of hints at some of the unique natures when we plant a new  tree.  They don't move.  Yeah.  Well, in that if they're managed properly, they can be kind of permanent fixture of a  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:48):**  farm or kind of a broader land management landscape.  But the point being, if we plant a tree, it can take anywhere up to seven years for that  tree to reach full maturity.  So these are, think about it from a financial perspective, you're making a large initial  developments investments with longterm future proceeds, right?  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:25:13):**  And as much as it reaches maturity in year seven, most of the cashflow then comes after  a 10 year period.  And so from an ideal standpoint, I think a structure that is, I'll call it long lived  in nature, if not evergreen, and that has defined on ramps and off ramps for investors  to get in and get out and redefine periods of time.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:25:40):**  That way, you kind of satisfy, I'll call it three different set of stakeholders.  There's probably more than the following three, but let's call it the natural lands and the  greater kind of land management set of stakeholders in that you are better able to manage these  assets and be stewards of these assets in a way that works within what nature kind of  gives you and takes away from you from your incentive then kind of is to plan for the  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:12):**  long term.  So that's kind of what's called the natural stakeholders is one.  The other set of stakeholders that the structure then benefits are kind of investors.  The investors have the ability to continue to invest or continue to own these assets  for as long as they choose.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:31):**  But it also has the feature of allowing them to exit for their own considerations at any  point in time.  I think the notion of having capital locked up without an exit is something that none  of us would accept, not to say that we don't want to be long term holders of stocks or  bonds or farm assets for that matter.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:53):**  But as things change, we do want that flexibility.  That's obviously a value.  I think that in the last set of stakeholders are kind of the people in the communities.  And Wood was kind of referencing this in a different way a moment ago in terms of talking  about resilience.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:27:09):**  But I think part of the risk in investing in agriculture these days has to do with the  health of the communities that we work in.  So our ability to come and really make a commitment to a community and people within that community  that these assets are those investments, our presence is going to be there for multiple  decades is of growing importance in terms of community resiliency.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:27:37):**  But also that community is, I'll call it investment in us, people, resources, the businesses that  are able to make those types of commitments and be contributing members of those communities,  not only extract, but have the opportunity to give back.  And if you will, there is an opportunity to virtuous cycle.  So for example, during this period of COVID, we over the last couple of years, we implemented,  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:06):**  I'll call it not necessarily costly or cheaper labor practices, but ones that were more focused  on creating kind of a permanent workforce, one that is more fully employed on a time  basis, but also kind of have gainful employment over a long period of time.  And those workers response and the communities response in a period of time where they believe  a partner is at the table and working with them and after the same goals, not only in  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:36):**  terms of their financial health and their wellbeing, but their communities and getting  healthy and good food to the people in their communities as well to a global audience.  It does show up in terms of risk reduction and return.  It is in a straight line.  I can't necessarily parse out what portion of our return is due to the goodwill that  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:57):**  we've built it up in the communities.  But I can tell you for certain when we, when the world was shutting down several weeks  ago, our teams kind of pulled themselves up by the bootstraps and were partners with us  and trying to figure out what to do and how to keep businesses running and keep the assets  running and making sure food is grown, food is picked and food gets to the destinations.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:20):**  It sounds crazy, but in this current environment, that's not a trivial statement.  And it is in large part due to those people that are on the front lines in our business.  And we think a lot of their, not all, I don't want to overstate what we've done, but I bet  you if you go talk to them, the things that we do matter and it matters in terms of how  they approach their work and how they engage with us as a business and with the investors  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:45):**  that we represent.  One of the things that I take away from what Atish just said as well is sort of almost  a broad or big 10 definition, if you will, of regenerative agriculture.  You started this conversation by saying, what brought us to soil?  We have our own answers for that.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:00):**  But to be honest with you, I think when you really are trying to build a fully value creating  agricultural business, you have to think about what regeneration means across a number of  different areas as well.  So sure, it's regenerating soil.  It's also regenerating habitat.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:16):**  It's also regenerating local communities.  And I think all three of those things, how we're regenerating or rebuilding working landscapes,  how we're regenerating natural resources, air, water, soil, and how we're reinforcing  the quality of rural agriculture, rural economies are all three part of it for us.  And you can't have them to me and to Atish and to our team, you can't have a fully baked  
**[0:30:41-0:30:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:41):**  picture of regenerative agriculture without all those things.  I would argue that this work we're trying to do to sort of piece together or put together  year round employment for our teams.  It's fundamental and I don't think many people realize how different that is from, because  I know many farm communities now that are scrambling because the asparagus pickers may  
**[0:31:01-0:31:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:01):**  not show up or the strawberry pickers may not show up.  Correct.  It's imperfect for us, but it is very intentional for us how we do that and who we partner with  to bring that to fruition.  And if you think about the way Atish described our business, I mean, there's a lot of reasons  
**[0:31:16-0:31:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:16):**  why we have the ability to farm the crops we farm.  We have track record.  Hundreds of our team have track record in those crops.  We happen to be operating in places where supply chains are very efficient for those  kinds of crops.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:28):**  So it's great for that purpose.  There's access to global markets from where we are.  There's all these different pieces that are great.  But another thing that I want to bring to your attention is if you think about the beginning  of the year, January to March or April, we've got California citrus and we move into California  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:44):**  blueberries.  Then we move into Oregon blueberries.  Then we move into Oregon hazelnuts.  Then we move into California table grapes over the course of a calendar year.  And that's, you know, some in our business may argue that I don't think it is.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:58):**  I actually think it's essential to how we think about synergies that exist across the  business, whether it be labor, whether it be water, whether it be equipment, whether  it be these other pieces that actually help build a truly resilient system that doesn't  always get hammered when there's some blip in the time horizon.  So I don't want to overstate that.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:17):**  But I do think there's a lot to think about there, and I think a lot about that should  be reassuring to investors about how broadly we're thinking about that diversification.  I think it comes down to a discussion we as society need to have not only on the food  system, but definitely on the food system.  How far can you push an efficient system or how far can you push a system for efficiency?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:39):**  And when does it start to become very risky when shocks happen, which we are now living  in a world where shocks constantly happen, either weather or other things.  And the fact that you can still ship grapes or you can still ship citrus compared to neighbors  that that are that can't or to other portfolio pieces of investors that simply are completely  blocked.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:00):**  That's going to make the difference at the end of the year to an OK result, to a good  result or to not OK at all.  And I think the push for efficiency and for supply chains that were managed very, very  well when everything goes well, it's perfect until stuff doesn't go well anymore.  And we have to realize that it can come from anywhere and it might be weather and it might  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:21):**  be something else.  But these shocks are not going to go away.  And I think we especially important in key areas like food, like health care issues,  we need to be thinking very differently about efficiency and effectiveness because you want  to have access to these things, because it's not that you can wait two months or something  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:37):**  because we still need to eat.  I think there's going to be a discussion, but obviously it sort of collides with our  efficient investment thinking as well.  So it's going to be a very interesting period when everything slowly and again, we're in  April 2020, so we're still thinking we're going to slowly reopen.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:52):**  I don't know if they were going to look back at this podcast.  I think that never happened.  But as we're slowly probably going to reopen, we're going to think about efficiencies and  we're going to think about, I think, food systems very differently, or I hope at least  because this should be a wake up call for a lot more shocks that are as we're all looking  
**[0:34:08-0:34:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:08):**  into climate change are on the horizon.  So when I end, I want to be conscious of your time because I know you have other things  to do.  I want to end with, I say one final question, which never is the case.  I want to end with two final questions.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:19):**  If you could change one thing overnight, so we wake up tomorrow.  I already asked that more specifically about a fund structure, but let's take it broader  into regenerative agriculture and food.  If you have a magic wand and I want to ask both of you the question, and if you could  one thing could be changed tomorrow, what would that be?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:35):**  Yeah, let me start.  So it's actually simple, but if I was king for the day, I create a kind of a graduated  or progressive tax system that lowers the tax for long duration for holds to zero.  So other way to state that, maybe the better way to state that is one, a tax system that  would incentivize people to hold for longer periods of time and decrease the tax for the  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:04):**  longer you held something down to zero.  And would?  Well, assuming that I can have two things.  I mean, you're king for the day, so I mean, I'm not deciding anymore.  I would say a robust and active market for carbon that would incentivize regenerative  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:21):**  practices at a multitude of scales.  That would be amazing to be able to turn that on today.  And right now it's too hard.  We're scrambling, we're struggling too hard to get to a place where that actually is meaningful.  And secondly, I would say I have gotten to the point where I am absolutely done with  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:38):**  this dichotomy that people want to create between small growers, small family farms,  and larger producers.  We do not believe in that dichotomy.  We actually believe that the only way to do this in a meaningful way is to build healthy  ecosystems that involve producers at a number of scales who are incentivized, inclined,  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:00):**  motivated to work with each other in a variety of ways.  And I see people calling me today saying we work with small growers or medium sized growers  who are really struggling right now trying to figure out how to get their product to  market.  There should be easier ways for those people to work with folks like us to be able to help  
**[0:36:14-0:36:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:14):**  them with packing or help them with shipping or helping them with marketing.  But right now there is a split that exists in the food system.  And I would argue that it largely comes from the smaller side of the equation where they  look at large growers, large producers, and put labels on groups like us that I think  are completely inappropriate and out of sync with sort of what the reality is.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:35):**  We want to, going back to my comment about land management and soil and doing this at  a scale that really matters, we want to actually get to a place where there is a lot more land  that is managed to the ideal degree that a small grower would bring to their own family  farm.  And we have the ability to do that at a scale that we haven't been able to see before.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:55):**  And I think that's something that we all should think about in building truly resilient, connected  communities of producers and growers.  So I'd like to see that conflict go away.  And here comes my final question.  Might open another box of Pandora, but what are your plans in terms of fundraising your  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:14):**  ideas for the rest of the year?  For April 2020, as we said, you are thinking, considering, or were at least a third fund.  What is your thinking there?  Maybe I'll start on that one, Cohen, and let Atish finish.  But I would say, I get excited about, you and I have talked in other contexts about  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:30):**  better ways to sort of bring farms and operations like we have to life for investors who may  not be able to travel as well, who may have a difficult time trying to figure out what  to do in this particular context.  How can we bring our operations to life in a way that actually capitalizes or mimics  some of what we would normally do and getting someone out to fill the soil or be on the  
**[0:37:48-0:37:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:48):**  ground?  I think that's exciting.  I would just say something very simple here.  We want to continue to tell this story.  We want to be able to have as much inbound questions and comments and engagement from  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:59):**  people who are interested in these kinds of ideas to help us advance what we're trying  to do.  So continue to tell the story and do it in more creative and meaningful and post-COVID  ways that we possibly can.  But Atish is on the front lines of that, so I'll let him finish.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:14):**  Yeah, and appreciate the question.  So I'll quickly say due to securities regulations in many parts of the world, we can't get into  any details in terms of what our plans were and what they will be.  But let me, of course, let me mention maybe two or three kind of interesting topics that  we hope to explore and maybe a year or a year and a half from now, come back and do a follow-up  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:39):**  and kind of tell you how things went with some of these topics.  So one, I'm very curious to see how people internalize risk regenerative environmental  issues past this COVID period.  That is not only just food system and supply chain resiliency, but kind of broader environmental  resiliency.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:03):**  Is this the wake up call, right?  That kind of breaks the camel back in terms of really motivating more interest.  So I'm just on a human level, I'm actually very curious how people internalize risk and  opportunity after this period of time.  Aside from the maybe more heavy kind of topics, I'm also actually very interested to see kind  
**[0:39:23-0:39:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:23):**  of the practical implementation.  I think 2020 was going to be a pivotal year in terms of ESG regulation and reporting in  Europe.  And we're very curious, we can already share that the amount of inbound interest from Europe  has been amazing over the whole history of AC, but in particularly the last 12 months  
**[0:39:49-0:39:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:49):**  and the last year and beginning of this year before other issues obviously took our attention  onto other topics.  So I'm very curious to see how Europe implements some of the stated changes that have been  in the works for a couple of years.  I think the last thing I'm curious to see is how do investment opportunities change  
**[0:40:13-0:40:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:13):**  and how do we fit in that landscape?  Not due to a COVID kind of COVID trigger, but kind of more broadly, I think the interest  from individual investors and family and offices and institutions globally have just been increasing.  And there's nothing to say that that trend isn't going to continue to increase.  I think the thing that we're interested in seeing is how does that change behavior for  
**[0:40:40-0:40:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:40):**  investment managers?  How does it change the products that are available to the average investor?  We're shocked that on a daily basis, we're getting emails from just individual investors  who have somehow found us on their own and say, these are the things that I want to be  investing in, the things that you're doing.  
**[0:40:58-0:40:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:58):**  How do you invest?  And unfortunately, we don't have that consumer offering just given for a number of different  reasons.  But if that interest is there, and just based on data and inbound interest, I can tell you  that interest is there and increasing.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:12):**  How's that really going to change what investment products are available to us on a daily basis?  And what that means in terms of how do large asset managers and fund managers think about  what they're doing?  I'm always optimistic about where consumers can take us over the long term.  And I think here, there's a lot to be hopeful for, especially in terms of the next generations  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:35):**  coming up, because they don't see the distinction.  They just see this as investing, right?  And all investing is going to have this embedded in what they do.  Otherwise, they're not going to have those individuals as customers.  So those are the three things that I'm really curious to see how they shake out for us as  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:50):**  we kind of go to our next steps over the next 12 to 24 months and is taking us to interesting  places in terms of discussions.  Perfect.  Thank you both so much.  I want to make sure we end more or less on time, which we are doing.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:42:05):**  And thank you for a first time.  I don't think it's going to be the last time we're going to talk.  I hope to unpack many more of these pieces as you're continuing your journey.

Why are we doing this course?  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:43:22):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:43:38-0:43:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:43:38):**  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?  
**[0:43:46-0:43:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:43:46):**  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?

**[0:43:59-0:44:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:43:59):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:44:19):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:44:33):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:44:48):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:45:11-0:45:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:45:11):**  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  
**[0:45:27-0:45:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:45:27):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  For making any investment please find professional investment advice.

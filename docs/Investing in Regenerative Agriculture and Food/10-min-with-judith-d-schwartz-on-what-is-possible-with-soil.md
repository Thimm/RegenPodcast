**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:00):**  You're listening to the summary of the interview. For a link to the full-length episode, please check the description below.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:09):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the Planet Mattered,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:14):**  a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:19-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:19):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:26):**  while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:29):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration? Because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:34):**  have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:38):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers, start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:47):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I will definitely continue to do so  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:53):**  and release about an episode a month. But at the same time, I would love to take this further,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:58):**  share more interviews, there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture,  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:03):**  more depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:08):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:12):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:19):**  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:24):**  And now, without further ado, the interview. Enjoy!  
**[0:01:30-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:30):**  You're going to listen to an interview with Judith D. Swartz, writer, author of two very important books in the regenerative agriculture space.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:38):**  One on cows and soil carbon mostly, and one on water and the water systems we usually don't consider.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:45):**  So I was at this conference and I heard a statement that simply would not let me go.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:55):**  And that was that over time, more CO2 has gone into the atmosphere from agricultural practice, from the soil, compared to the burning of fossil fuels.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:07):**  And that fairly hit me over the head because I felt that I was somewhat knowledgeable about climate change.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:20):**  That for every increase of soil organic carbon of one percent,  
**[0:02:27-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:27):**  that represents an additional 27,000 gallons per acre of water that can be held in the soil.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:37):**  How do you pick a title for your book?  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:41):**  Perspective, I was thinking about it and writing a book about soil.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:45):**  I mean, soil is kind of like a word that might in many instances end the conversation.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:51):**  Oh, I'm writing a book about soil. And someone might look at you and say, OK, that sounds very interesting.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:56):**  I think I'll move to the next person I might meet at this cocktail party.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:01):**  You know, it just you know, soil isn't considered sexy.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:08):**  The way I often look at it is so in trying to understand challenges that we have,  
**[0:03:16-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:16):**  one can look at natural systems and ask, how did our natural environments deal with those challenges?  
**[0:03:24-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:24):**  So holistic management, this particular way of approaching the management of grazing animals,  
**[0:03:33-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:33):**  it resolves a challenge that in nature, how do arid environments, specifically areas of seasonal rainfall,  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:46):**  which is a large percentage of our climate, it happens to be of our planet,  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:51):**  not where you live in the Netherlands or where I live in Vermont in the United States,  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:56):**  where we have moisture distributed fairly evenly throughout the year.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:00):**  But in much of the world, we have rainy season and a dry season.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:05):**  And so nature had the challenge, how do we maintain moisture in the soil in order to sustain plant and microbial life  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:16):**  from the end of one rainy season to the beginning of the next?  
**[0:04:21-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:21):**  And the solution that nature came up with was through the behavior and the digestive system of grazing animals.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:31):**  So since the way that we humans have been managing the earth,  
**[0:04:39-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:39):**  we lack the predators that had managed those animals and we lack the huge roving herds  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:48):**  that had existed in these seasonally dry landscapes through history.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:54):**  And so that leaves a void.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:57):**  So that void can be filled by humans managing grazing animals in a way that they had acted in natural ecosystems,  
**[0:05:08-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:08):**  so that the grazing animals, they would nibble the plants in a way that stimulated the growth of plants,  
**[0:05:17-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:17):**  their waste hydrated and fertilized the soil, and their trampling pressed in the decaying, the dying plant matter,  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:29):**  the dried out plant matter, so that it could be acted upon by the microbial life,  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:34):**  all of which maintain moisture in the soil.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:38):**  And those animals were in turn were managed by predators that would keep them on the move.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:45):**  And without those predators in our landscapes right now, then we humans can manage those animals in the same way.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:54):**  Sometimes when I explain the book, I say that it's an exploration of water as a verb, as opposed to merely water as a noun.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:08):**  What struck me was that in our conversations, our public conversations about the California drought,  
**[0:06:19-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:19):**  what was missing was land.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:22):**  That drought was looked upon as a matter of what does or doesn't come down from the sky.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:28):**  And land degradation was not mentioned at all all over the US during the California drought.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:35):**  And the headline was something like, we needed, I think it was 11 trillion Olympic swimming pools worth of rainfall  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:47):**  so that we could beat the drought.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:49):**  And that amused me because, well, that's all very well and good.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:54):**  But if we continue to degrade the land, the huge expanses of land in California that are used as that are range lands,  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:05):**  once thriving grasslands or agricultural lands, if we mismanage them well,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:12):**  then 11 trillion swimming pools worth of rainfall won't really help the problem.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:19):**  In fact, that would be a waste of perfectly good swimming pool water.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:23):**  However, if we did restore those lands and really focused on how to manage them better,  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:30):**  then maybe we could get away with much less in terms of our swimming pool use of water.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:36):**  While we look at climate change as a matter of carbon, we're missing the fact that water is a huge thermoregulator of our planet.  
**[0:07:52-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:52):**  That our water processes, infiltration, transpiration, evaporation, condensation, have such a huge impact on the energy balance of our planet  
**[0:08:11-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:11):**  that I wanted to bring in water as it can affect climate.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:22):**  That plants are running the show, the extent to which plants are running the show.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:28):**  So there's an Australian farmer author, kind of maverick thinker named Peter Andrews.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:37):**  And there's a quote from him that I like to refer to because I think it's so telling.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:45):**  And that is this, that plants manage water and in managing water, they are managing heat.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:54):**  Our financial system does not make any sense because we are rewarded for practices that are ultimately diminishing our natural wealth.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:09:15):**  Just listen to the summary of the interview. For the full length interview, please find the link in the description below.

### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:00:14):**  What would you do if the company you founded got sold and suddenly you found yourself not  having to worry about your financial future at all?  Or better or worse, you have way too much money.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:00:23):**  So what's next?  Our guests of today faced those questions and ended up starting and funding a venture  and a movement in the Netherlands trying to tackle the fundamental issue, some would say  
**[0:00:32-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:00:32):**  the root cause of all our agriculture issues, private land ownership.  He really wants you to ask the hard questions.  Where did your money come from?  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:00:41):**  What is enough?  What would you do with the rest?  And what do you want your legacy to look like?  
**[0:00:45-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:00:45):**  So join us in this fascinating conversation where we cover inequality, impact investing,  land ownership, unsustainability, Charles Eisenstein, and so much more.  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, investing as if the planet  
**[0:01:04-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:01:04):**  mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in regenerative food and agriculture space to  learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:01:18):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:01:28):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  To make it easy for fans to support our work, we launched our membership community and so  
**[0:01:40-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:01:40):**  many of you have joined us as a member.  Thank you.  If our work created value for you, and if you have the means and only if you have the

**[0:02:06-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:02:06):**  So welcome to another episode today with Walter Feer, the founder of Lentiland and many other  things we're going to unpack in this episode.  And a friend of the show has been supporting for a long time and he was hosting us today  
**[0:02:16-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:02:16):**  in Blue City, which I will put a link below if you're interested in the location, which  is very fitting for what we are doing, although it's not in the countryside, it's in the heart  of Rotterdam, one of the main cities in the Netherlands next to the river.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:02:31):**  So we have an okay view.  We're a bit inside, but we can see the water.  So welcome Walter.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:02:36):**  Bit of a rainy day.  Bit of a rainy day.  It's not amazing weather.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:02:40):**  Let's summarize it in that way.  It's very Dutch.  It's good for the soil.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:02:43):**  Let's keep it that way because we had a very, very long drought.  But it's pouring outside basically.  But I'm very happy to have this interview, which has been a long time in the making and  
**[0:02:52-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:02:52):**  I'm very curious to unpack your journey into soil and land ownership mostly.  So welcome to the show Walter.  Thanks Gun, nice to be on your show finally.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:03:02):**  And to start with the personal question we always start with, why soil?  How did your twist and turning journey ended up on agriculture, food and then specifically  land ownership?  
**[0:03:13-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:03:13):**  Yeah, so I don't think I'm really deep into soil.  I'm more, I'm kind of an entrepreneur and I've developed a model now that evolved around  developing regenerative community farms.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:03:30):**  But I think the first seed was planted when I saw the famous documentary of John New.  I think more than 10 years ago, Hope in a Changing Climate, in which he documents the  regeneration of the Lus Plateau.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:03:54):**  And we have in Holland, we have Vepirot Tege Licht, the famous show that looks into all  kinds of themes.  And they made a few episodes about this documentary, I think they were called Green Gold.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:04:12):**  And I saw them about 10, 11 years ago in a phase where I was taking steps back from the  company I had.  And then I think that that's the first seed.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:04:24):**  And you remember seeing that because it's interesting many times on this podcast, it's  a documentary or it's a movie or a book even or photographs that trigger something, but  it's often visual very interestingly, although we're on an audio medium now.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:04:40):**  Did it trigger already something in your entrepreneurial mind or was it more, oh wow, this is possible?  Because it's really like, if you haven't seen it, I'll put a link below.  The before and after is beyond stunning.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:04:53):**  It's amazing what has been done in China in that period.  But what triggered it for you?  Was it, ooh, this is cool.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:05:01):**  And then the next days, of course, you were back and running your company or ooh, there  should be something there that became a bit itchy as an entrepreneur.  Like, ooh, if that's possible there, why not other places?  
**[0:05:13-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:05:13):**  It didn't trigger any entrepreneurial thought yet, although almost everything does.  So I think I've been a born entrepreneur.  I didn't know that I was born, but I was always thinking about things that I could do differently.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:05:28):**  And then I was, when I was in university a year before I finished, I was studying mechanical  engineering in Delft.  And then I started my first business, an employment agency.  
**[0:05:46-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:05:46):**  And at that time, I was, like I said, taking steps back and thinking about new plans.  I took about two, three years.  And when I saw it, I mainly was, I was struck by the quantity of problems that could be  
**[0:06:08-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:06:08):**  solved if we do things differently with land.  It's not just a regeneration of land and good for biodiversity and carbon storage and water  management, but it also brings back community, it brings back economy, it brings back life  
**[0:06:31-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:06:31):**  basically to that piece of land, it brings back life.  So, and in the years after that, so I think two years later, my search resulted in a big  new adventure that's called iFund.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:06:54):**  And maybe we can talk about it a bit more, but iFund is a foundation I started then and  I donated a lot of my money to the foundation.  And with the foundation, we started investing in startups that accelerate the sustainability  
**[0:07:12-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:07:12):**  transition.  And all these times with iFund, it was in the back of my head that I wanted to do something  with land and regenerating land, but it didn't fit the purpose of iFund.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:07:28):**  So with iFund, we were investing in companies, in startups, in businesses and not in projects,  not in land-based projects.  So it took a while for this seed to bloom into something else.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:07:44):**  And what triggered that, the blooming?  Because seeds can be dormant for many years and decades and potentially even hundreds  of years.  
**[0:07:51-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:07:51):**  So what triggered that?  Well, some more seeds actually.  So this was one important seed that is on the foundation of Landland and to put it in  
**[0:08:02-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:08:02):**  perspective, so this was, I think 2011 maybe.  And then in 2021, I started Landland.  In 2014, I started iFund and I've been working hard and intensively on iFund and all side  
**[0:08:20-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:08:20):**  projects that came from iFund for the years after that.  And one other seed is, I think, the way I look at the financial system.  So I always try to look at things in a systemic way and not to, so that when you try to solve  
**[0:08:46-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:08:46):**  something you're not solving some consequence, but you want to solve kind  of the root cause.  So I've been thinking about the financial system for a long time and also because I  
**[0:09:07-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:09:07):**  made a lot of money for my company and it was always a bit strange to me to think about  what does it mean?  What does this money mean?  
**[0:09:15-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:09:15):**  What does it mean when you have more wealth than you need?  And well, one of my conclusion after years of studying that is that all the, I mean,  the two main problems in the world, I think, are inequality and unsustainability and both  
**[0:09:38-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:09:38):**  find their origin in the financial system.  So one other seed is my conviction that there are some big mistakes in that system.  And the financial system, I mean, money is a very handy tool to trade so that people  
**[0:10:04-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:10:04):**  can specialize.  But I think it wasn't designed or meant to accumulate wealth.  And that property of money has infected all other kinds of things, among which land.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:10:22):**  So the fact that that is now we find it normal that when you possess something, it should  give you an advantage, you should be paid for that or you should accumulate something.  So if you own a lot of money and people need it, they should pay you rent.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:10:46):**  If you own a lot of land and someone wants to use it, they should pay you rent.  If you own a lot of houses and someone wants to use it, they have to pay you.  And I think that's a big mistake.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:10:58):**  And the underlying question is also how does someone, usually one person accumulate so  much, in some cases during his or her, and in many cases his lifetime with a lot of luck  and hard work.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:11:11):**  I think it's definitely a lot of luck, but also in many cases just because you were born  in the right family.  Yeah, yeah, because you're very lucky.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:11:19):**  And then the economic game we're all playing gives an advantage to the ones that are already  in front.  So then it's easy to accumulate more.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:11:34):**  But going back to land land, one of the aspects where you see this is, of course, land ownership.  And we find it so normal that land is privately owned.  But the other day, one of my children was on the internet and said, hey, dad, you can  
**[0:11:53-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:11:53):**  buy a piece of the moon.  Look, here's the website and there are certificates and everything.  And I was laughing a bit and he said, no, really, really, it's authentic and you can  
**[0:12:03-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:12:03):**  buy a certificate.  And I said, okay, and who are you buying it from then?  But that sounds, of course, it's ridiculous, but why is it different on earth?  
**[0:12:16-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:12:16):**  Or the bottom of the sea or air.  But do you remember, because going from questioning and unveiling some very big mistakes in the  economic system to land ownership might seem in hindsight a very logical step, but do you  
**[0:12:34-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:12:34):**  remember when you sort of, I wouldn't say clicked, but look at that core problem of  wow, ownership is actually private ownership of many things, which we've never done until  very, very recently.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:12:46):**  Let's not, this is not something that's been around for millions of years.  Do you remember when that click, was there another documentary or a book or was it a  slow going like, ooh it's land.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:12:56):**  It's land.  So the first seat was this documentary about regeneration on a large scale.  The second seat was this realization that land ownership is a strange thing.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:13:12):**  And also, you know, of course it's, you can't go into farming if you're not rich or born  in a farmer's family.  And there are so many young people that want to start a CSA or go into farming, but they  
**[0:13:27-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:13:27):**  can only lease a small plot of land and two years afterwards they get kicked off.  So they never can start growing like trees, everything.  They have to stick to what do you call one year annual vegetables, maybe some chickens  
**[0:13:44-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:13:44):**  that's like perennials is risky, asparagus maybe, but yeah, it's very limited because  you get kicked out for some development.  So and then the third seat was actually more of like a private plan that I had for four  
**[0:14:02-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:14:02):**  years because, you know, from 2011 to 2014, I was really looking into, okay, what do I  want to do?  And I was looking at all these reading books, watching documentaries, like trying to really  
**[0:14:19-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:14:19):**  feel what kind of big transitions are coming towards us.  What problems are we going to face?  And you know, what I saw was where are we going to face water shortages and we're going  
**[0:14:32-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:14:32):**  to have water wars.  We're going to face food shortages.  We're going to face energy crisis.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:14:40):**  I mean, and in 2022, you can pick any page and there are three  news items about this.  It wasn't like this 10 years ago, but I felt that was coming.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:14:54):**  And one side of me has been working for 10 years to, on a really small scale, help start  up some businesses that, you know, help us find a soft landing after we go through these  transitions also maybe to soften them a little bit.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:15:14):**  But I also had this urge to buy a piece of land myself and be self-sufficient there.  So grow my own food, harvest my own rainwater, have some trees to make my own heat, everything.  Also because I was a little bit scared of where the world was going.  
**[0:15:40-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:15:40):**  So it's also, there's also kind of a little prepper in me, like a prepper mentality.  You were like looking at New Zealand, like some other rich people?  Not the prepping way where you have a closet full of guns and container storage and barbed  
**[0:16:00-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:16:00):**  wire fences around your plot.  No, I think so.  So you were on the market, you were actively looking at places, because I remember this  
**[0:16:11-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:16:11):**  period, we've known each other for quite a while, that you were looking, okay, where  can I be where sea water rising is not, we're in a country which half of it is practically  under sea level and not now, but in the future or when the dikes break.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:16:26):**  So you were looking at plots of land a bit higher, a bit away, like strategically looking,  okay, where do I want to be?  Before that I realized also when I started iFund and the companies that we're investing  
**[0:16:35-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:16:35):**  in with iFund, we've been doing that now for eight years, we're also always looking at  these entrepreneurs and asking ourselves, are they contributing to a world that we see  in front of us, like in 20 years where this globalization is a bit something of the past.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:16:55):**  And it's not like everybody is growing their own food and making their own energy, but  it's more like we do, like my vision is a regional economy where everybody knows where  their food comes from.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:17:08):**  So you don't have to make everything yourself, but you know where it comes from, you know  where your energy comes from, you know where your water comes from, you know where your  resources come from.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:17:18):**  And so that's also kind of, how do we become more resilient?  So my own drive to become more resilient and also thinking that a more resilient world  for everybody is more beautiful.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:17:35):**  And so that's a third seed, the urge to be more resilient, not just for me, but for the  world.  So that's the resilience thing, the financial system thing and the land ownership, and then  
**[0:17:50-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:17:50):**  watching what regeneration can do.  And then I think in 2020, those three came together.  Because it went from, I would like a place for myself and my family and be resilient  
**[0:18:04-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:18:04):**  in that family sphere, let's say, to something a bit bigger.  Yeah, but also a bit broader than that.  So I was making plans about a small eco-village, let's call it that.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:18:19):**  And then how did it go from there?  Of course, your entrepreneurial mind started to knock on the door and say, yeah, but about  there.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:18:25):**  That's probably not the only person that works there.  Actually, I was, as you said, I was actively looking, I started that a few years ago.  And then in 2020, when the COVID crisis hit, I picked those plans up again because they  
**[0:18:37-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:18:37):**  were in the fridge.  And then I started actively looking for land.  Also like you said, above sea level, because we, one of the, of course, indigenous practices  
**[0:18:50-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:18:50):**  is looking seven generations ahead, 200 years.  So 2020, 2020, sorry, 22, 22.  Yeah.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:19:00):**  Nobody talks about 22, 22.  You know, everybody talks about 2030 or 2050.  But in Holland, most of the country is below sea level and sea level is rising quickly.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:19:11):**  I think it's a wise thing if you look like 100 or 200 years ahead that you build something  that's above sea level.  So that, and yeah, it started with actively looking for something for my small eco village.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:19:27):**  And then I thought, when I actually find something now, who is going to buy that?  Is anyone back to your land ownership question of course.  And that's a difficult question once you are so convinced that this system is flawed and  
**[0:19:42-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:19:42):**  then you're looking for something for yourself and then you find something and then you vision  yourself sitting at the notary, who's going to be on that deed.  So that couldn't be me.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:19:56):**  And then because not only because of this, but this conviction about land ownership,  but also the question, what happens when I'm gone?  And then there's this beautiful eco village and then I'm gone.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:20:12):**  And then maybe my children think this is all bullshit and they cancel everything.  That's not the way things should go.  Because they want to buy some pieces on the moon.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:20:20):**  You don't know, you don't have the, maybe, maybe they need some liquidity.  Or on Mars.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:20:26):**  The ownership structure, especially in the longer, also in the short, because we're all  convinced about our own convictions and we're fine and et cetera, but things change, life  changes, situations change, longer term, everything changes.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:20:39):**  So how do you make sure that we get to the steward ownership piece of course, that the  stewards of the land are able to steward the land long term and are not selling to buy  pieces on the moon or somewhere else or do whatever.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:20:51):**  So that led to a sort of existential crisis.  Like who's going to actually buy this?  Who's going to buy it?  
**[0:20:57-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:20:57):**  Yeah.  So, and luckily I already had done this before because in 2014 I founded a foundation and  I donated my big portion of my money to the foundation.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:21:11):**  So it wasn't mine anymore.  And then with the foundation, we started doing all these impact investments and building  a team.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:21:18):**  And now we're, I found this five people have done more than 20 investments.  And when I, when I die, nothing happens, you know, there's, there's no, it continues.  It continues.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:21:31):**  Yeah.  Nothing has to be sold or it's, it's so easy.  There's a board in the foundation and of course I'm in the board and then I can't do that  
**[0:21:40-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:21:40):**  anymore, but everything goes on.  And that's, I think more investments and entrepreneurial things should, should go that way.  So the question wasn't really difficult for the, for the EcoVillage or for my personal  
**[0:21:57-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:21:57):**  project.  I had to start a new foundation.  So I was making plans for the new foundation.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:22:09):**  And in the meantime, I was talking to all kinds of farmers and other initiatives and  projects in Holland that were doing something with regeneration, something with land ownership,  something with small community farms, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:22:30):**  And I was getting more enthusiastic, more enthusiastic every, every year with, after  every appointment.  And at that moment I thought, and then the company I still was, I sold in 2015 for the  
**[0:22:46-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:22:46):**  major part, I still had some loans and earn out arrangements there and they got paid out  in, at the end of 2020.  And then I thought, I don't need this money.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:23:01):**  I'm going to put that all into this new foundation.  And then we can start at least four of these projects and not only one for myself.  Of course this was the moment where my wife thought, oh no, here we go again.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:23:19):**  This is not the first time.  She was already envisioning the EcoVillage.  Yeah.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:23:25):**  For the two of us and some, yeah.  So it's going to be a new, like, well actually it's a new venture.  It's a new, and it's a foundation, but it feels like, it feels like a business.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:23:38):**  So I started a foundation Lantaland and again I made a pledge to donate a lot of money to  the foundation, 10 million actually.  And in the meantime, I, I developed ideas about what we're going to do and how we're  
**[0:23:58-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:23:58):**  going to set up these farms and run them and find farmers for them, et cetera, et cetera.  Now fast forward, we're talking the end of 2022.  You bought two farms.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:24:13):**  One is fully up and running or is in the process of getting up and running.  And they're both are kind of in the start of phase.  We have farmers and they're doing things.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:24:23):**  Let's talk about the one that's mostly in the news.  Maybe I can say a little bit more about, about, about the model because the, the, the idea  is we have farms of 10 to 20 hectares and there has to be a house.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:24:42):**  So and that's a little bit difficult because we, we can't find the third and fourth farm.  Now we're looking very hard, but it's so difficult to find lots of land that meet our criteria.  So it has to be, there has to be a house.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:24:54):**  It has to be above sea level.  It has to be kind of in the vicinity of enough people so you can have a short, short food  chain.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:25:10):**  And every farm, it's not owned by the foundation, but the foundation starts a new co-op, cooperation,  a cooperative, and then the cooperative, we finance the cooperative with loans and the  cooperative buys the land and the house and the farmers get into the cooperative and then  
**[0:25:31-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:25:31):**  the cooperative starts after, after they've started the business, they offer certificates  to the community.  And so then the community slowly but sadly becomes owner of the cooperative and then  
**[0:25:50-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:25:50):**  the loans get repaid to the foundation and then we can start more farms.  So it started with an idea of, so now we can do four.  And it evolved into a model that, that we thought maybe, maybe we can make a lot of  
**[0:26:03-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:26:03):**  lot more if, if people also want ownership of these, of these farms.  And so the model is really you with the foundation basically kickstart these, these locally owned,  not the futurely locally owned farms that set up their own cooperative, manage locally.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:26:18):**  Of course, there's all kinds of governance structures there to make sure it doesn't get  sold, doesn't become a villa area, doesn't etc, etc, etc.  That will be farmed with the best regenerative practices we can imagine.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:26:31):**  And we can't make profits on added or of value, rising value of the land.  So no speculation.  No speculation.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:26:42):**  And then slowly when you, you bought the piece of land, because of course, like buying land  in Denelos and many other places, when they are in the market, you need to step in.  It's not that you can spend six months raising money from the crowd locally, etc, etc.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:26:55):**  No, you buy it, you start it and then slowly, hopefully the local community steps in and  starts buying certificates, hold that ownership, can get out as well if they want to at some  point, but it will never be sold, will never be speculated with the land itself.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:27:09):**  And you hopefully get your loans back and do it again, do it again, repeat, repeat,  repeat.  And then so we're now in the middle of that process actually with two farms, which is  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:27:17):**  very exciting.  So how is that going?  What are, I mean, let's say, let's start with how is it going and how did that happen?  
**[0:27:23-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:27:23):**  Because you're buying two farms like that is not, no small feat and finding farmers  to farm it is even more difficult.  So what are we looking at now at the end of 2022?  
**[0:27:35-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:27:35):**  So well, finding farmers, that's a nice process.  I think both processes took about, I think about three months.  So and yeah, for both farms, we found great farmers.  
**[0:27:53-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:27:53):**  And well, let's take the farm in Holland.  One is in Belgium and one is in Holland.  Let's take that for example.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:28:00):**  We have two guys there.  They're living there with their families and they're involved in the community.  They're building a market garden.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:28:11):**  They're building a public time harvest garden with fruit and berries, etc.  And in the meantime, we also built our own crowdfunding platform.  You're gonna see, he's laughing, but let's say your software background comes back in  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:28:28):**  that.  You had to build your own platform.  Yeah, I had to build my own platform.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:28:31):**  And it's working now.  It's making the world a bit more complicated.  Yeah.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:28:35):**  But it's nice to have your own platform if you want to do things in a specific way.  So yeah, and now we're in the crowdfunding has started about five weeks ago, six weeks  ago, we're halfway there.  
**[0:28:50-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:28:50):**  Of the first tranche in the end, we have to fund, I think 2.8 million euros for this farm  of which 80, 81% goes into the ground and the buildings.  And we have to renovate.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:29:05):**  The land is not cheap.  The land is not cheap and renovation is not cheap.  We have to build another house there.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:29:12):**  And the rest, 19% is meant for, you know, starting up the business, working capital,  plants, seeds, machinery, et cetera.  And so it's a very exciting and scary time at the same time because all of your plans  
**[0:29:27-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:29:27):**  and then, okay, how does it work with the foundation setting up the farm?  And then hopefully the community steps in or in general, the community doesn't always  have to be obviously people locally that are also customers and clients can be anybody.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:29:38):**  We personally also invested, hopefully steps in enough to allow you to do more than four  because otherwise it will be four, which is amazing, which is still a lot of impact.  But yeah, you're targeting 40 plus and much more of course.  
**[0:29:51-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:29:51):**  So what are the lessons learned until now?  Is land ownership, I would say, sexy enough?  Is it like, is it hitting a nerve you feel or is it also, is it tricky?  
**[0:30:03-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:30:03):**  I think we can't generalize the lessons yet because it's so context specific.  And I think the context for this farm is it's in really a rural area where everybody knows  each other and they all help each other, but they're also a little bit hesitant.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:30:28):**  And you know, the way we are farming there, that's not something they know and not necessarily  something they believe in.  And so you're looking at the weird ones from the back to the land movement, as we discussed  
**[0:30:42-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:30:42):**  in the interview on duck eggs, like your, ah, yeah, there are another few people that  buy a few hectares, they're going to try something.  Let's give them a few years and let's see what happens.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:30:51):**  From Roux's quote, they come in a car and go back by bike.  They leave on their bike.  Yeah.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:30:58):**  So let's hope that doesn't happen.  But there's of course a resistant and very understandable rural versus urban because  usually it's been that way.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:31:08):**  Usually fancy people come from the city and claim all kinds of stuff, fancy between brackets,  claim all kinds of stuff, we do it differently, we come and help you, blah, blah, blah, blah,  blah.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:31:18):**  And that usually turned out to be a bit different.  Especially if you're doing very different egg practices, of course, it looks, feels,  smells completely different.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:31:26):**  So we invested a lot of time in getting to know all these people and hearing them and  hearing their doubts and explaining what we're going to do.  And that actually went very well.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:31:38):**  But investments from really the local, local community, only the people that, you know,  the family of the former owner and the neighbors, they did something.  But most people in the rural community, they think we already have a plot of land and we  
**[0:31:52-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:31:52):**  grow our own food.  Why should we invest there?  And I think also that the investments from the really local, local community will only  
**[0:32:04-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:32:04):**  start to go when, maybe after a year or two, when they actually see what's going on there.  So most investments now come from people that are a little bit further away.  And well, we're halfway our first target.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:32:23):**  We targeted the first campaign on 350,000 euros.  So we're halfway there now.  Of course, we hoped that everything would go a lot faster, but I'm still very happy  
**[0:32:35-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:32:35):**  that we're here and we're learning a lot of things and learning how to tell our story  because it's a complex story.  We didn't choose an easy model because, I mean, the reality is complex and it's about  
**[0:32:55-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:32:55):**  land ownership.  It's about regeneration.  It's about cooperative and community.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:33:01):**  It's about knowing where your food comes from.  It's about non speculation.  It's all this transparency and all the things we have in there.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:33:10):**  It doesn't make it an easy story.  It's not an easy 50 second video on your crowdfunding platform that explains it all.  And now, for example, we were very close to starting something in Utrecht province where  
**[0:33:26-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:33:26):**  there are a lot of words.  It's not so rural, but and I think if we start cooperative there, it would be very easy to  fund that in a matter of months and for the full amount.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:33:41):**  So I think we will learn in a few years where what our story should be dependent on the  context.  Yeah.  
**[0:33:53-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:33:53):**  Because you didn't choose and it was a difficult route, very understandable.  Like a friend of ours, both of ours, actually, Thomas Ripple, they work with farms already  existing.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:34:05):**  There is a community already that's been built over years.  They've been buying from them and been working there.  Kulturland.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:34:10):**  Kulturland.  So there's already that Mycelium network that will respond to something interesting and  useful and relevant, etc.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:34:17):**  In this case, you have to build all of those connections from the beginning and then you  come with an ask, which, of course, is very challenging and needs time.  All of these things, unfortunately, always need time.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:34:29):**  But that's yeah.  Luckily, you have the time or I mean, we're running out of time, but you have the time  to experiment, to see, to fine tune your message and see that.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:34:40):**  And in terms of the farmers in this case, because they build their life on that land  and of course, you don't want to kick them off after two years.  How involved are they in like how, how much of it can they actually see the land as their  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:34:53):**  quote unquote land?  Of course, it's not their land.  It's all of our land and it will never be speculated and sold.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:34:58):**  But how much can they really act as if it's their land and how protected are they from  the normal unfortunate leasing or leasing structures where you can be kicked off any  time and thus you won't never invest in regenerative practices.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:35:15):**  I'm not sure what you...  How involved are the farmers, like the two that are now farming on the farm in the Netherlands  and the one in Belgium?  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:35:26):**  Are they on a yearly contract?  How involved are they?  How much can they act like it's their land?  
**[0:35:31-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:35:31):**  First of all, they are part of the cooperative and they're a member of the cooperative and  they have a specific member type that's meant for farmers.  Then we have a member type that's meant for the foundation and then we have a member type  
**[0:35:43-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:35:43):**  that's meant for the community and the investors.  And the member type they have give them the right to be in the board of the cooperative  and make all the daily decisions.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:35:55):**  It's not that I can come as an investor.  I don't want carrots, but I want you to grow this.  That's not there.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:36:03):**  So they decide what they're going to grow and how, etc.  And at Lantaland we have a lot of experts that help them make decisions and we can give  them advice.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:36:18):**  And of course, it's a wise thing for them also to ask their certificate holders and  their community what they want to eat.  In theory, they can stay there forever.  
**[0:36:30-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:36:30):**  Lantaland, the foundation, can send them away, but only if, and that's all documented, if  they breach the agro-ecological principles or some other essential things for the cooperation.  So they really feel ownership and that's also what we find important that they're not, it's  
**[0:37:08-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:37:08):**  not just a job and they get paid for 40 hours a week and then they're gone.  So that's why we want them to live there and we want them to feel like they own the place.  How we do that is, so one way is to give them a contract and then they're just a paid worker.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:37:30):**  The other end is they have to lease the land themselves and start their own business and  take all the risks.  So we're a little bit in the middle there.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:37:40):**  So we give them a basic income and of the basic income they can live, but not more than  that.  They can't buy anything new, they can go on holiday, but they can live.  
**[0:37:52-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:37:52):**  They get this basic income until the cooperative starts making enough money and making a little  bit profit and then their income rises to a kind of a normal income.  And then after that normal income, they get 20% of all the profits above that.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:38:13):**  And 80% of the profits of the cooperative go to the certificate holders.  So that way they have like a safe basis to start their own farm.  The first profit adds to their income and then they have normal income and they still,  
**[0:38:32-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:38:32):**  you know, if they do it really well, they are incentivized.  And so taking a step back and looking at what you've learned now, what would you tell other  impact investors or other investors looking for influencing, let's say this land ownership  
**[0:38:50-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:38:50):**  discussion of cars without giving them investment advice, because that's not what we do.  But what would you tell them to look for or to read or where to go to learn more or where  to go and to start if they want to be active, if they have this urge like you had and have  
**[0:39:08-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:39:08):**  as an entrepreneur and investor?  Yeah, that's a difficult question because I think I'm more of an entrepreneur than I'm  an investor.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:39:16):**  Luckily, I have some money to invest, but then I invest, then I see an opportunity to  start something and then I invest in that.  So I don't know what a passive investor actually could do, but finds other entrepreneurs that  
**[0:39:34-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:39:34):**  they believe in.  And I think it's also a question of what kind of investor are you and what do you want with  your investment?  
**[0:39:43-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:39:43):**  And what, so this brings me back to my thinking about the financial system and what do you  do when you have too much money?  And too much is not a light word.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:39:53):**  You know, you can simply calculate what you need for yourself and maybe you want to give  your kids a nice start in life.  But everything above that, you can't take it with you when you're six feet under, you  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:40:09):**  know?  So what do you want with that?  What is it?  
**[0:40:14-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:40:14):**  And how did you get it and where did it come from?  And why are you afraid to lose it?  Why do you want to make more with something you never can spend?  
**[0:40:28-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:40:28):**  So the question, I also says, do you want more money or do you want more ecology?  And I, I'm not arguing that you should just give it all away.  But what I do is I invest that excess money in something that, I mean, I can lose it and  
**[0:40:53-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:40:53):**  then I've actually, I've lost nothing because I already had that piece that I needed for  myself.  But I'm just, I'm going to start someone and start, you know, buy a piece of land and just  
**[0:41:08-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:41:08):**  pay people to do the right thing there and then try to make a business around it and  see where that gets you.  And hopefully you're building something that adds value to the lives of the people around  
**[0:41:19-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:41:19):**  it and then, and then they will pay you for that, you know?  But you can't calculate that exactly when you, when you, when you start.  So you're saying that the question before is actually, who are you serving?  
**[0:41:32-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:41:32):**  And Charles said it on our podcast, I think, who are you serving?  Ecology or money?  Like who is your, your, your master?  
**[0:41:39-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:41:39):**  And like, what is enough?  Where did it came from?  In this case from, from a company and very lucky.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:41:45):**  I mean, you worked really hard, but got very lucky and suddenly accumulated way too much  money for one person or one family to ever spend.  And we've seen many examples actually that going where that goes really, really wrong.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:41:57):**  So you're saying go to go a few steps back.  Like what does it mean?  Where does it come from?  
**[0:42:02-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:42:02):**  How much is enough?  And then what do you do with the rest?  So you, the investor advice would be, you know, it depends on, I mean, is it okay if  
**[0:42:14-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:42:14):**  you lose a little bit of it?  If not, then I can't give you good advice because I think there are no more investment  opportunities in this world where that are safe.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:42:24):**  You know, that's been, those opportunities have gone a long time.  So what's your risk appetite?  Both in ecology and in money.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:42:34):**  Yeah, but also what do you want to build?  I mean, and if you, if you have money and you invest it and then like 10 years later  you get it back with the 50% gain, then you have to think of another thing to invest it  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:42:47):**  in.  Oh man.  Yeah.  
**[0:42:51-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:42:51):**  So just put it in something that builds something, creates something and then yeah, just leave  it there, you know, and get the gains from there or something.  So it's a natural bridge.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:43:03):**  It may not seem like that, but what would you do if tomorrow morning you wake up and  maybe get an inheritance or somehow you get access to a significant amount of money?  Not that you didn't have that before, but like a billion euros, like which used to be  
**[0:43:18-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:43:18):**  crazy amount.  Now it's even less with all the inflation.  Let's say you had a billion and I'm not asking this for specific euros amount, et cetera,  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:43:26):**  but I'm asking what would you prioritize?  In your case, would you put it all in land ownership?  But what would you do first?  
**[0:43:31-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:43:31):**  Would it enable you?  Would you say, actually, I don't want any of this because it's too complex.  What would you do with a billion euros if you woke up tomorrow morning to in control  
**[0:43:39-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:43:39):**  of that, which could be the longest investments you can imagine.  Like it doesn't have to be any, any fund like returns, but what would you do?  You know, I'm already doing Lantaland, you know, and I put 10 million in there.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:43:56):**  I wouldn't know what to do with 1 billion.  So in my, the true answer is if I got 1 billion and that this accounts for everybody that  earns some money, it comes from somewhere, you know.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:44:16):**  Meaning money and money and debt are two sides of the same metal.  So basically when you simplify a little bit, the economy is a zero sum game.  So if you gain something, it's coming from somewhere and someone else has more debt.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:44:34):**  That's why I think people with more than enough money should also feel that they have a responsibility  because your money came from somewhere and there are now, it's drained something, you  know.  
**[0:44:50-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:44:50):**  So you have to get it flowing again.  And if I got a billion tomorrow, I would seriously think of just giving it away to the people  that have the least.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:45:02):**  So I would just give directly to the poorest.  And if you would be pushed to quote unquote invest, I mean that's an investment because  it for sure pays back whatever X, 50 X in terms of life safe healthcare environment,  
**[0:45:22-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:45:22):**  et cetera.  They're very, there's very good data.  Let's say give directly and provides if you, if you don't know the movement, but what would  
**[0:45:30-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:45:30):**  you find inequality thing you have to do?  But if you would be forced quote unquote to put your investor hat on, where would you  focus on?  
**[0:45:40-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:45:40):**  It's so difficult because like Bill Gates is buying up farmland everywhere around the  world.  That's not what we want.  
**[0:45:49-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:45:49):**  You know, I could think, okay, I would buy farmland and then put it into cooperatives  and neutralize the land ownership, but I don't think that's the way it should be.  I shouldn't, I shouldn't be then I shouldn't be the owner of all this land that, and then  
**[0:46:03-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:46:03):**  start all these farms, you know, the community should be the owner.  So if I were forced to invest.  Would you donate to like the local community around this current farm in the Netherlands  
**[0:46:13-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:46:13):**  to enable them to.  Yeah, why would you donate it?  They can, they can buy it themselves, you know, so if I were forced to invest a billion.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:46:22):**  Maybe you're the first one ever on the podcast that says, no, I don't, I don't pick up the  phone.  I don't, you can figure it out.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:46:31):**  I wouldn't know.  No.  Of course, with the iPhone we invest in startups and scaleups and usually we invest a few hundred  
**[0:46:41-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:46:41):**  k per company.  So I could, I could use some extra funds to fund some more stars, but a billion, I wouldn't  know what to do with it.  
**[0:46:51-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:46:51):**  So if you, if you would say 10 million, I would know what to do with it, but a billion  is too much.  And we take away your fund.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:47:03):**  So the billion and this, this, this, this heavy lift on your shoulder so you can breathe  again.  But you do have a magic power now.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:47:10):**  You have a magic wand that you can change.  One thing could be in food and egg specific, but actually let's say your, your global view  and your interest in the money system and economic system and in ecology makes me want  
**[0:47:25-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:47:25):**  to ask this question a bit wider.  So if you could change one thing anywhere, even on the moon, what would you do?  The root cause of every, every predicament we're in is the financial system.  
**[0:47:39-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:47:39):**  So also regenerative agriculture and all the things we're doing, it wouldn't be this necessary  if we wouldn't have this capitalist economy that's working on advertising and consumption  and more consuming more than we need.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:48:00):**  And this drive of people are being forced in competition with each other.  We need to win from each other or from the earth.  That's the only way you can survive in this capitalist game.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:48:13):**  And the root cause of that is interest.  So if I had a magic wand, I would change the property of money that's called interest.  Before there was money, all real assets in the world, they slowly become less valuable  
**[0:48:36-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:48:36):**  or you have to maintain them and it costs a lot of money or you have to guard them with  a lot of money.  But every real asset doesn't increase in value.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:48:43):**  Yeah, maybe compared to the money system we have now, but in intrinsic value, everything  decreases in value.  Your boat, your tree, your land, your house, your clothes.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:48:55):**  So maybe compared to in euros, your house, if there's no euros, your house decreases  in value.  Everything decreases in value.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:49:04):**  In nature everything decreases.  And that's because we have a money system with a different property than nature.  That's why they're so much apart.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:49:22):**  If we have a money system where your money just loses 5% each year, then you're there.  Then you don't have to, then the economy doesn't have to grow exponentially.  Then I would loan you a thousand euros easily.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:49:39):**  And when you pay me back a thousand next year, it's a good deal for me because then I have  more.  So then you bring economy in line with ecology actually.  
**[0:49:49-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:49:49):**  And then also inequality becomes less and less and unsustainability becomes less and  less.  So you would use the magic wand to raise interest.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:50:03):**  And I want anybody interested in this.  I don't want to raise it, make a negative interest.  Anybody interested in this, read Sacred Economy, Charles Eisenstein in general.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:50:15):**  And there's a lot on that actually.  How does that, like if that's the root cause, why did you, this could be a whole different  rabbit hole, why did you decide to start Lendaland?  
**[0:50:30-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:50:30):**  Is that an indirect way of like fixing the land ownership discussion to fix this interest,  this positive interest, which should be negative basically?  I don't know what it does to the sound.  
**[0:50:42-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:50:42):**  Lendaland is also, it's not addressing this root cause, it's also a symptom.  Yeah.  If I, for years I have been thinking about starting a new currency and I've researched  
**[0:51:03-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:51:03):**  it for years, made plans, made a coin design, everything, a coin that wouldn't be speculative  of course, that's the problem with all these cryptocurrencies that are speculative.  We're in the middle of one of the big fraud cases again.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:51:19):**  And that stimulates local economies at all kinds of properties.  Why didn't you do it?  Because when I was going to do it the way I wanted to, I had to get a bank permit and  
**[0:51:36-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:51:36):**  then I thought, well, let's do that.  Cost us something, cost some time and then let's do it.  But in the end I thought that the chance that that would succeed was, you know, rounded  
**[0:51:53-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:51:53):**  was zero.  So maybe it was a 0.001%, but the chance was just too small.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:52:02):**  I can't change the financial system.  So yeah, I gave that up.  But it stays.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:52:07):**  Yeah.  I mean, I was going to say it's in your fridge, just like other plants and seeds which have  been there for a while.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:52:12):**  And do you see it ever, what would be needed or to get that chance to tend or something  that makes you want to give it a go?  Are there conditions that need to be, like what is the area needed for this seed to start  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:52:26):**  blossoming?  Because it's planted and with many people, I think.  I don't know.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:52:32):**  The forces of the system are so big.  One of the things, when I made these plans, I knew that the first years of this new coin  would be very difficult and it would be very hard.  
**[0:52:47-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:52:47):**  You had to push very hard to get a small base of users, companies and private people.  And then you had to build a small economy that the money could also circulate and not  all end up in one place, which usually happens with alternative currencies.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:53:06):**  And then the only way that it would really grow big is if the current system would fail.  Because then what you saw increase years ago and in other places where the currency fails,  then alternative currencies have a chance.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:53:23):**  But the current system is too easy for everybody.  And that's also when I researched all the other alternative currencies that are there.  And the only predictive value about how big they would grow is how much the group of starters,  
**[0:53:44-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:53:44):**  or what do you call it, the people that started it, the founders with how many they were and  how long their stamina was.  But it felt like having a balloon with a small hole in it.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:54:01):**  And if you blow really hard, it can get some volume.  But if you stop blowing, it's gone.  And that's what it probably would be.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:54:09):**  So I didn't find a way yet to design it in a way that there wouldn't be a balloon with  a hole in it.  It's very interesting because I suddenly remember with Thomas Rippel of Kulturland that he was  
**[0:54:26-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:54:26):**  researching a stablecoin as well and was, I think, many people in the, let's say, not  the alternative currency world, but that are deeply questioning the current economic system.  Funnily enough, end up, or I know two of them, but they end up in land ownership, which is  
**[0:54:41-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:54:41):**  very interesting and probably as a sort of roundabout way.  That's why you can do something.  You can do something.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:54:47):**  So that's also what I see with Landelung.  I mean, it's kind of a small, I don't know how to change the system.  I don't know how to change the political system.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:54:56):**  I don't know how to change the capitalist system.  I don't know how to change the agricultural system.  I don't know how to change the financial system.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:55:02):**  But I do know, I think, how we can start a small new system where everything works in  the way we want it.  And that's also a little bit of a Landelung.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:55:12):**  Just a small system with a few hundred households around the farm.  And maybe we can make four and maybe we can make 400 and maybe we can make 4000 and then  we don't need the existing system anymore.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:55:27):**  Because there you can almost naturally pan it out.  There will be complementary currencies born on these experiments because it would be crazy  to use euros for many of those things.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:55:39):**  Especially when they fail.  And that's not far away.  That's my prediction.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:55:44):**  Yeah.  But I think you've been saying that for 10 years.  But it's always like the moment before it seems very stable as we just saw with a massive  
**[0:55:50-0:55:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:55:50):**  crypto crash.  And then two days later, everything is in these systems are also very unpredictable,  very fragile.  
**[0:55:58-0:56:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:55:58):**  And yeah, we don't know when and how it happens.  But it's very interesting to see that land ownership is such a, it's probably the base  of many of the speculation and many of the wealth created or quote unquote wealth created  
**[0:56:11-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:56:11):**  because somebody put a fence around something and said, this is mine.  And now you have to pay to rent it or you have to pay to even walk on it or you have  to pay to eat from it, etc, etc.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:56:22):**  I think it's a topic we're going to explore more and more on the podcast.  It keeps coming back as one of the root causes, if not the.  And I want to thank you so much for your time.

**[0:57:38-0:57:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:57:38):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  how to put money to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:57:52):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision-making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:57:59-0:58:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:57:59):**  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:58:04-0:58:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:58:04):**  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  
**[0:58:08-0:58:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:58:08):**  How to approach this space for whom is this course?  You the soil builders and investors in the space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  
**[0:58:22-0:58:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:58:22):**  platform builders, act tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  designers, holistic management, consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:58:34-0:58:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:58:34):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  et cetera.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:58:45):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:58:48):**  Meaning, I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:58:59):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you.  And if you have the means to consider paying what you think it's worth, thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:59:09-0:59:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:59:09):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:59:22-0:59:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:59:22):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:59:34):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:59:47):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:59:53-1:00:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wouter-veer#t=0:59:53):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

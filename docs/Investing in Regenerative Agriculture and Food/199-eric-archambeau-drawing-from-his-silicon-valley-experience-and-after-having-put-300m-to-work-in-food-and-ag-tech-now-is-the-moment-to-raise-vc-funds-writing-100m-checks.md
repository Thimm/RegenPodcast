### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2022-12-20)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:00:14):**  We talk about it at conferences and discuss it over coffee.  We should get institutional investors, the pension funds, the insurance companies and  a very large asset managers investing in this space.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:00:25):**  But very few people have actually raised from these players and thought about their role.  Today we are joined by someone who has done just that and plans to raise a lot more and  put it to work.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:00:36):**  As the early stage space is slowly getting crowded.  Luckily we need to start thinking about who can write hundred million dollars or euro  checks to give the scale ups in the region ag and food tech space the time to really  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:00:48):**  grow.  And we discuss why now is the moment for regenerative food and ag as healthcare costs are getting  out of control.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:00:55):**  Computational players are forced to invest in impact technology and raw computational  power make almost magic possible.  And most importantly, the enormous influx of talent focusing on food, ag and soil.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:01:15):**  This is the investing in regenerative agriculture and food podcast investing as if the planet  mattered where we talk to the pioneers in regenerative food and agriculture space to  learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil people local communities  
**[0:01:30-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:01:30):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  have their roots in how we treat our land and our sea grow our food what we eat wear  
**[0:01:44-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:01:44):**  and consume and it's time that we as investors big and small and consumers start paying much  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet to make it easy for fans to support  our work.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:01:55):**  We launched our membership community and so many of you have joined us as a member.  Thank you.  If our work created value for you and if you have the means and only if you have the means

**[0:02:22-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:02:22):**  One that's been a long time in the making friend of I can say friend of the podcast  or a follower and supporter as well which obviously I want to thank Eric for.  I've been following the journey of Eric and Asta Noor and also Qualia for a long time.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:02:35):**  We had Qualia many many years ago.  I think it was the first 30 episodes or something.  But I really wanted to have Eric on to explain a bit of his journey into this fascinating  
**[0:02:46-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:02:46):**  world of impact investing and then even deeper into food and ag.  So welcome.  Thank you for hosting us as a podcast in your office with a magnificent view on the city  
**[0:02:54-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:02:54):**  of Brussels and I see some some wind turbines turning not so many farms but probably if  I look far enough I can see some.  But welcome on the podcast and thank you for making time.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:03:03):**  Thank you very much Koen.  And to start with a personal question we always love to ask.  Why soil?  
**[0:03:10-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:03:10):**  With all the career paths you could have chosen I would say after your time in Silicon Valley  like you could have gone a hundred different routes.  How did you end up in the world of food, ag, farming and not the easiest path let's say  
**[0:03:25-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:03:25):**  and impact investing?  Well impact investing is something I've been growing into for over 15 years now.  But what led me to soil is more like food that led me to soil.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:03:44):**  One is I'm definitely a big foodie.  That helps.  I got involved in a number of food related projects, personal projects including investing  
**[0:03:55-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:03:55):**  in a few restaurants not because of the trying to make money.  You never make money in the restaurants.  Listen to this.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:04:02):**  If you're interested, if you're at the curve of investing in a restaurant for money reasons  step back and think of it as a hobby because statistically you're not going to do it.  You're not going to make money.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:04:13):**  Even in the best restaurants at best you're going to get your money back.  But I was very fortunate to meet a few chefs that were really inspiring in their vision  of the need to change our approach to food and that led to in the supply chain to where  
**[0:04:37-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:04:37):**  this food came from.  And working with a few scientists also, again, I became close to one of the very well known  chefs in London called Jamie Oliver who through a series of evolution in our relationship  
**[0:05:01-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:05:01):**  asked me at some point to become chairman of his foundation for food education.  She was mostly working with kids and I discovered the really deep problems of our food system  which has been, and I've said that a couple of times before, but has been developed over  
**[0:05:22-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:05:22):**  the past 70 years to deliver very efficiently cheap calories throughout the world but not  cheap nutrients.  And in doing so we have been producing huge problems on the health side so people are  
**[0:05:39-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:05:39):**  being developed all kinds of metabolic diseases, especially diabetes type 2 that should not  exist in the world but unfortunately does exist and is touching more and more people.  In the US it is estimated today that 30% of people who are born after 2000 will have developed  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:06:03):**  diabetes type 2 by 2030.  So this series of...  Tomorrow basically.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:06:07):**  It's tomorrow, it's huge.  And the other number which I wanted to give before I go back to the soil is that, which  is a really scary number.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:06:17):**  Today Americans spend $1.1 trillion on food every year.  And by coincidence, but definitely it's linked, the healthcare system in the US spends 1.1  trillion, the same amount of money to try to cure the diseases that are caused by the  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:06:48):**  poor nutrition of people.  And we're talking mostly about diabetes type 2.  Plus then another...  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:06:54):**  1.1 trillion.  Yeah, another two times that amount.  I think there was a Rockefeller study on true cost accounting.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:07:01):**  The cost of the food system just in the US is three times what the US population spends  on it.  So it's the health and then two times environmental and social.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:07:09):**  Exactly.  And then I get to the soil because...  It's four basically, four X.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:07:12):**  No, it's three X.  So 1.1 spent on the food by the consumers.  1.1 spent partly by the same consumers, partly by the state to deal with the healthcare issues.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:07:27):**  And 1.2 trillion spent that is not being accounted for really today, but is the cost to the environment,  including the soil, a lot to the soil, biodiversity, environmental and so on.  And so it all starts with the soil.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:07:46):**  It all starts with the fact that we have been growing mono crops for the past...  Do you remember when that clicked?  I mean, you started with food and of course the connection with these chefs to soil, but  
**[0:07:57-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:07:57):**  do you remember, was there one moment when you were like, whoa, it all starts with soil.  This is not just on the taste, but also actually on the environmental piece, which is for many,  I think actually for me was a big shift going from, of course, we eat better food, it's  
**[0:08:10-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:08:10):**  better quality, better taste, better paid for farmers, et cetera, et cetera.  But to see the switch to water, carbon, biodiversity, like it literally all starts with the soil  was quite an eye-opener for somebody who didn't grow up on a farm.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:08:22):**  Was that the same for you?  Or was it unnatural to see the potential of the issues and the potential of soil in all  these areas on health, carbon, water, biodiversity?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:08:34):**  So as I said, I didn't grow up in a farm.  I didn't study...  I spent quite a bit of time now with scientists, UC Davis from Van Eenigen, from other places  
**[0:08:48-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:08:48):**  on.  I don't agree now, but at the time I was really new into that space.  So I came from this food side being really aware of all the things around corn and high  
**[0:09:04-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:09:04):**  fructose corn syrup, all the things that I got into, trying to understand these monocultures  and how, including in Europe, the monoculture, which is sponsored by subsidies to keep this  status quo, where you basically have a system that you keep subsidizing, not just the farmers,  
**[0:09:31-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:09:31):**  but the system that brings all the entrance that you have to put in the soil.  And the soil becomes just a very dead substrate.  And the ha-ha moment on the soil itself goes entirely...  
**[0:09:48-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:09:48):**  The credit goes to my friends at Soil Capital.  So I became, at that time, at the very beginning of Soil Capital, Chuck came to me.  I became the first private investor in Soil Capital because I really believed in the vision  
**[0:10:05-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:10:05):**  of soil, of Chuck.  And he took me to Fredrick Thomas' farm in Solong.  And Fredrick Thomas showed me the difference between his soil, was using regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:10:25-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:10:25):**  and the soil of his neighbor, who did not see the point of using...  I think today he still doesn't see the point of the neighbor because he gets all the subsidies  to do things.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:10:37):**  Why would you?  And suddenly it was the ha-ha moment when Fredrick started to dig in the soil and showed  me the difference in the soil between the two.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:10:48):**  And everything clicked together.  I'd write a number of books on the invention of synthetic fertilizers and all these things.  And then suddenly I saw that.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:10:59):**  It was very abstract until then, and that very moment was the famous ha-ha moment where  I said, geez, there's something to be done here.  And I decided to dig in, whether there would be a number of technologies that could be  
**[0:11:15-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:11:15):**  developed and or sponsored for that.  And that was by Céline Dibéty.  I didn't meet her because I already met her before, but this very famous scientist in  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:11:28):**  France who happened to have a summer house next to my summer house in France.  Céline Dibéty.  Céline Dibéty.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:11:34):**  Dr. Pascal Kosar, who is the Secretary Perpetua de Académie des Sciences.  So she's like the chairwoman of the French Science Academy.  So someone fairly knowledgeable.  
**[0:11:49-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:11:49):**  And she's the person that actually discovered the role of listeria and how listeria goes  from cows to the soil, back to the cows and everything, and how things, there's a link  between the microbiome of the soil and the microbiome of the animals and people.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:12:10):**  And until her research in the 1990s, people did not really understand that there was a  microbial life on the soil because it's anaerobic, which means that as soon as you bring it to  A lab.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:12:25):**  The lab is dead, so you don't see anything.  You say, okay, you know what?  We don't have to worry about it.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:12:30):**  Just put NTK and everything will be fine.  So her work or pioneering work with listeria gave birth to all the things we have been  looking at.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:12:39):**  And it was a very new field of understanding the microbiome of the soil.  You were discussing that in front of your summer house.  You happened to talk about gardening maybe in soil.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:12:52):**  You discovered that she was-  And fishing.  Fishing and that she was that key figure or-  
**[0:12:57-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:12:57):**  Yes.  And I said, wow, this is a signal, I have to do something about that.  So between the visit to Fethi Toma, then a few weeks later, my discussion with Pascal  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:13:11):**  and I thought, this is fascinating.  Things are happening right now.  There's a new sector, there's a new potential revolution.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:13:18):**  And then my friends in Silicon Valley, around 2009, there was a big breakthrough in deep  learning.  So the first company I started as a CEO and co-founder was one of the first deep learning  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:13:34):**  companies, but way too early.  Was very frustrating.  We didn't have enough computing power.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:13:38):**  We're dealing with single layer neural networks.  Shallow learning.  Shallow learning, single layer neural networks, very slow.  
**[0:13:46-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:13:46):**  It was a bit frustrating from that point of view.  Then my friends who the people I hired in my company fresh out of universities in the  early 90s, where by then senior or even senior engineers or even managers or directors of  
**[0:14:04-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:14:04):**  data mining in the big companies at Google.  And so a friend of mine actually was the head of search for Google and working on all these  things.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:14:14):**  And then some people who worked for me ended up being the head of data mining for Amazon  and for Twitter.  A good birthplace for many careers.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:14:24):**  Yes, exactly.  But they were reporting to me with a lot of excitement this breakthrough in artificial  intelligence.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:14:33):**  And I kind of say, maybe there's something to be done between applying that to, so basically  what has become today, synthetic biology and all these things.  So I started to look and I found that there were quite a few people working on that already,  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:14:50):**  starting to work on that.  So I said, OK, you know what?  This is happening.  
**[0:14:53-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:14:53):**  There is a big breakthrough, a combination of AI and biology that's going to change.  It will eventually change the way we look at agriculture.  It's going to be changing the way we have been looking at things.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:15:06):**  We have been making very important simplifications that are not correct anymore.  Agriculture is not linear.  It's not NPK gives life.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:15:19):**  It's much more complex than that.  And now we have the means from a computing capacity to actually have much more complex  models that will lead to a new order in the way we look at things.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:15:36):**  So it's a very high level kind of thinking.  But it's a fundamental question that I think investors like yourself ask, OK, why now?  We knew or there's been reports coming out on the poor quality of soil and it's going  
**[0:15:50-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:15:50):**  down and of course, books coming out for the last 2030.  In some cases, if you go back with David Montgomery to 100 years ago, I mean, the early organic  pioneers in the UK did observe like observe science, but still saw the connection between  
**[0:16:04-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:16:04):**  healthy soil and other things.  And we still went on the path of 70 years of extremely intensive extractive ag and food.  So why now is it different than the underlying answer in your case seems?  
**[0:16:16-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:16:16):**  And there's a huge breakthrough in computing power, which enables 10,000 other things we  cannot even imagine yet.  And so you said, OK, I'm not going to continue.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:16:27):**  You can, of course, continue part of that in my foundation work and NGO work.  But I see an opportunity here to apply my VC and my Silicon Valley knowledge into this  new world and apply this breakthrough into ag and food.  
**[0:16:44-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:16:44):**  Was that already, was it a logical step like you from those few weeks of these celebrity  encounters, was it a very logical step to found Astanor or like what happened to it?  Like, OK, this is actually this could be a massive investment opportunity or it has to  
**[0:17:01-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:17:01):**  be and it should be.  And let's build that compared to many other paths you could have chosen, like invest in  some of these or set up a foundation to push against corn syrup and or to push computational  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:17:14):**  and deep learning.  Like what was that click to, OK, we're going to build an investment house, like quite a  substantial one.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:17:20):**  We'll talk about that and to invest in this space because there's the why now is now.  Yeah, I think I think it is.  It's exactly what you what you describe was this moment that I said, OK, there should  
**[0:17:36-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:17:36):**  be something happening.  But quite frankly, there was enough naivete in my in my in my thinking.  I didn't know enough about the sector to to think, OK, it's going to be so difficult.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:17:57):**  I shouldn't do it.  I think if I'd been a really follow up, a deep expert in the area, maybe I would have  said, you know what?  
**[0:18:05-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:18:05):**  I'm going to stay in, you know, what we didn't call metaverse at the time and and do gaming.  But the thing that really pushed me into that is I'd been fairly schizophrenic for a while,  you know, making investments in companies that were making money, whether they were  
**[0:18:25-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:18:25):**  social networks or Spotify or whatever, early stage, fascinating, you know, work to be a  venture capitalist is really great.  And I'm super grateful I've been able to do that for a long time.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:18:41):**  And when companies actually do succeed in becoming big companies, listening to this  through Spotify, is that a podcasting player?  Yeah, but there was something itchy.  
**[0:18:50-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:18:50):**  Yeah, it's fascinating to do that.  But at the same time, schizophrenia came from the other side of my my work, not for profit  was to, you know, work with social entrepreneurs, which were not very skilled.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:19:03):**  You know, they were not scaling for the most part.  Actually, all of them, none of them were really scaling when you think about.  And and then I saw the possibility of doing the two things together.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:19:16):**  And that gave me a boost of energy, you know, like, wow, you know, maybe I can do something  which is meaningful, which is really fun.  And making money at the same time so that making money is very, very important because  
**[0:19:31-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:19:31):**  it gives you the sustainability, it gives you the attractiveness of working with more  and more investors and really have a potential maybe one day to have a systemic impact, which  is really what I've been aiming for.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:19:46):**  Can we as a as a firm have a systemic impact on the planet?  Of course, we're not going to change the entire planet, but can we have, you know, some for  some part of the system?  
**[0:19:59-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:19:59):**  Can we really change it because of some of the investments we've made, some of the risk  we took, some of the conviction we managed to bring to others.  And that's really exciting and much more than making money for the sake of making money.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:20:13):**  And much more than giving money to a charitable organization that, you know, you feel good  about it, but you know that it's not going to change the world.  And so what was the original idea of Astana?  
**[0:20:33-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:20:33):**  Because you went big, you didn't go for let's raise 10 or 20 million and put that to work.  And you really went for it.  And we're going to unpack that as well to go after maybe not with the first fund necessarily,  
**[0:20:45-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:20:45):**  but definitely with the follow up ones to attract institutional capital.  Was that from the beginning your conviction, we need to go, I mean, I'll ask the one billion  dollar question, but you're pretty close to that.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:20:55):**  You're going to get very close to that.  Like was it from the beginning?  Okay, we need to move lots of zeros and not just a few to move the needle or was it something  
**[0:21:04-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:21:04):**  that happened because the wave started to roll as well and you managed to serve it quite  nicely.  Yes, we have 20 years of venture capital prior to Astana and a bit more from my co-founder  
**[0:21:19-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:21:19):**  George Guero, more like 30 years in this case before we started Astana, had told us that,  you know, money matters and amount of money matters in this business.  Why does it matter?  
**[0:21:34-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:21:34):**  Because of what we do?  We do things that require high conviction for a while.  Well high conviction, what I mean by high conviction is there are several ways of practicing  
**[0:21:48-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:21:48):**  venture capital.  One is you just follow, you know, the trend or you follow some people who are doing things  and you put money following those people.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:21:58):**  And statistically, if you have good investors in front of you, you don't have to have a  lot of conviction.  You just have to be, you know, to be convinced in a way that those people know what they  
**[0:22:09-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:22:09):**  are doing.  So I'm not going to give you names of firms, but you know, everyone knows.  Yeah, you can follow those firms and you'll do well and you don't need to have yourself  
**[0:22:18-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:22:18):**  full of conviction about the sector or the companies or the people that you're working.  There are times where it takes a while for a company to really take off, to really go  through a certain amount of time where, you know, things are going to look pretty bad.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:22:39):**  I mean, take Amazon, you know, it took quite a while for this company to become the powerhouse.  It lost money for a while.  And so investing in such companies, I'm not talking about Amazon.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:22:54):**  You need to have the stomach to stay.  Exactly.  But you need to have the conviction that between the idea, between the timing, the idea, the  
**[0:23:05-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:23:05):**  product market fit, and very importantly, the management team, which you may have to  augment, or you may have to do something about it, which is what we do most of the time,  you know, is help in one way or another.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:23:19):**  We help bring new people into that.  That's, you know, you're going to be pushed by a lot of people around you saying, I don't  believe in that.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:23:32):**  I don't understand how you can believe in that.  I don't understand how you can put money into that company.  I don't see the future.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:23:39):**  It's a big mistake and so on.  But if you are really convinced of that, you have to have the staying power to do that.  So if you have a really small fund and you're going to be pushed away by other people or  
**[0:23:55-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:23:55):**  you're going to be washed away or you won't be able to put the resources to sustain this  company for a while.  So that's what we thought from the beginning.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:24:10):**  Maybe we need to have that power to back our convictions.  It took much, not much longer.  It was much shorter than we thought.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:24:23):**  So yeah, the first fund that we wanted to raise, I mean, we had a very small fund that  was more like us and a couple of friends.  But the first fund we wanted to raise, we thought maybe we would be 100 million and  
**[0:24:39-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:24:39):**  then we'll have another one.  And then it turned out to be pretty much 300 million.  So that's three times.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:24:46):**  And then the next one, which I remember at the time, he said, we raised a bit more than  we expected, which is good, but it's also a challenge because of course, you have to  put it to work.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:24:56):**  It's not that you can leave it on a bank account for a while because you can follow your convictions,  etc.  But yeah, your investors expect you to put that away.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:25:05):**  So what made you decide to not put a hard cap at 150 or 200 and call it a day and take  the 300?  I mean, of course, it's a constant decision, but you were like, OK, actually, I can see  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:25:18):**  the deal flow and the quality for even that amount.  So let's do it.  Yes.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:25:22):**  I mean, that's the latter, actually.  When we started to look at the sector and made a few personal investments around 2015-16  at the very beginning, there were very few projects that made sense.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:25:38):**  We invest in the agri-economy at the very beginning of agri-economy, companies like  that, which now just raised a big round of financing.  But there were very few entrepreneurs that were having the combination of vision, a level  
**[0:25:59-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:25:59):**  of ambition that much desire to have a systemic impact and the technology breakthroughs, the  product.  Is that a fundamental one for you that it has to have that breakthrough piece you mentioned  
**[0:26:15-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:26:15):**  before that happened around 2009 at the core somewhere to not at the core somewhere at  the core, because otherwise it won't scale fast enough.  Would you say most of your companies have that somewhere?  
**[0:26:30-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:26:30):**  For the most part, yes.  I mean, virtually all of them.  But the technology breakthrough is not necessarily a company AI breakthrough.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:26:41):**  It could be something most of the time now, by the way, it is linked to biology in one  way or another.  And if it's not biology, it might be mechanical like monarch tractors, but linked to a way  
**[0:26:55-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:26:55):**  to deal with the soil in a very different way.  Because if you can pinpoint very precisely where to do things in the least intrusive  way and be very precise in what you are going to put in the soil, that's a big breakthrough  
**[0:27:18-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:27:18):**  from that point of view.  And it's time and the normal, let's say, VC timeframe of a fund.  We've discussed it many times on a podcast that it's not, yeah, it's tricky, let's say.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:27:34):**  It's difficult or it's a challenge, the speed of which returns are required and the speed  of which does these companies have to scale and grow, etc., which we need for the planet.  Let's not discuss that because of course, it's not we can wait 20 to 30 years because  
**[0:27:48-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:27:48):**  that's way too late, but the seven or eight or nine years, do you see that that was designed  for Silicon Valley and software, most of it and maybe part of hardware.  Have you experienced that as a challenge for, let's say, the food and tech space to like  
**[0:28:04-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:28:04):**  we need these returns relatively fast and we need to put 300 million to work.  Is that been a puzzle and thus a challenge or you said actually there's enough deal flow  that can do that and we are convinced that also with the normal VC, the traditional quote  
**[0:28:20-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:28:20):**  unquote VC methods we structure, we can actually we can make a meaningful bend.  That's a very good question.  I don't think we have a full answer to date, but you're right.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:28:33):**  It's not just about agri-food, it's also about other sectors that require longer time than,  if you develop an antivirus software, you push a button and you have a billion antivirus  software that are being pushed to customers.  
**[0:28:51-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:28:51):**  If you grow insects in a vertical farm, you push a button and then it takes nine months  for the thing to...  Which is fast for animal protein.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:29:01):**  And then another year for that and so on.  So it takes, you have to deal with nature and nature as seasons and nature deals with  these things, even if you can incredibly accelerate thanks to AI and computing power, for example,  
**[0:29:19-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:29:19):**  the selection of new species or new variety of plants that correspond to certain level  without doing gene editing necessarily, just looking at the acceleration of that today  with AI, you can go from 12 years to a year.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:29:36):**  But still it's a year and it's not three days.  That's why I meant initially about the breakthrough.  So did you tell your investors like, look, this is not your typical SaaS, Series B, this  
**[0:29:49-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:29:49):**  could take...  Or did you build something in to make it, to give you a bit more time or was that tricky  in the first place?  
**[0:29:56-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:29:56):**  It's a tricky thing.  Eventually we'll get there.  But you're right, you have to remind our investors for the most of them that it takes time.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:30:04):**  So every year we remind them that it takes time because it's human.  You know, you put money somewhere and you're antsy.  You say, okay, I want my money back.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:30:15):**  And they might go through that J curve and the difficult years.  And now with Fund2, are you doing things differently or is it mainly same investment thesis, bigger  obviously, or are there structural things you do differently?  
**[0:30:35-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:30:35):**  I think we have built a team.  So there's a difference between what we're doing at the very beginning.  You had two guys in the garage making small investments.  
**[0:30:50-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:30:50):**  And now we have more of a professional team with about 35 people on two continents.  And so it's a very different process.  But what we do and we really work hard on is to keep that pioneering spirit of every  
**[0:31:12-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:31:12):**  single deal is the most important deal we're working on.  And every single company we have invested in is the most important company that we have  ever invested in before.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:31:23):**  And keeping that, I would call that almost animal spirit, especially in the case of AgriFood  is very important.  So we are not, I think we're not complacent or anything like that.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:31:38):**  We think that it's just the very beginning.  I mean, this transition is going to be unfolding for the next 15, 20 years, at least in front  of us.  
**[0:31:49-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:31:49):**  And so we're just at the very beginning of what's going on.  And what has changed or has something changed of the appetite of investors, like the conversations  you have now compared to 2017, 18, when you were raising the first fund?  
**[0:32:06-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:32:06):**  Has that changed?  Are the institutional ones, the larger pockets, are they finally coming?  What has been in a very challenging environment we're in now, obviously we're recording this  
**[0:32:17-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:32:17):**  in November 2022.  What is your feeling of the markets or also of the second fund?  Is there more interest and also commission to actually put significant amount of work?  
**[0:32:32-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:32:32):**  I mean, you already raised 300 million almost, so significant definitely, but now you're  targeting a considerable larger one.  What has been the response from investors?  
**[0:32:42-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:32:42):**  So it's interesting because this year, not surprisingly, private investors, especially  in smaller family offices, are much more cautious about making long-term illiquid commitments.  There are a number of endowments and pension funds that have rules, prudential rules that  
**[0:33:08-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:33:08):**  make sense because of the disbursement.  You know, university endowments need to be able to disburse to students that need bursaries,  they need to do things with research.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:33:19):**  Time for pension funds need to be able to.  So they have ratios of public equities which are liquid to private equities.  And because of the collapse in the value of public equities, suddenly the value of private  
**[0:33:35-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:33:35):**  equities have gone up.  And for them, many of them totally stopped the new commitments in private equity, which  includes venture capital.  
**[0:33:46-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:33:46):**  So that's a little bit of a challenge.  On the other hand, what we are seeing for the first time is that the really large asset  managers, the big insurance companies, you know, the big multi-asset managers have a  
**[0:34:02-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:34:02):**  mandate or political pressure, depending on which countries they are in, to invest in  impact investing.  But being big institutions, they are looking for big tickets.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:34:15):**  That's why they have invested in some of the very large TPG and so on.  But now they are looking at...  Big tickets are 150, 200.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:34:25):**  It's very difficult for many of them to put less than 100.  For some really, really large ones, it's like 500 minimum.  And then the smaller one is 50 plus, you know, so.  
**[0:34:36-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:34:36):**  But we are seeing them suddenly because we have been growing recently in our fund size.  And we are Article 9, 9.3, which is very rare in terms of investment.  So it's the SFDR taxonomy to say that we are real impact, because real impact feels like  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:35:00):**  Twitter blue.  We are real impact.  You are real blue.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:35:04):**  Exactly.  It was 9.99 per month.  Exactly.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:35:08):**  So thanks to that now we are Article 9.  And that's, you know, there are not that many places where those people can invest.  So suddenly we see a lot of interest, the theoretical interest for now.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:35:20):**  But I think it's good news for all of us who are working sincerely in that sector that  are genuinely investing in impact investing for the agri-food space.  There's a handful of funds that are doing that at a certain size.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:35:38):**  And I think it's very important that we have that power to invest in later stage investments.  They are not just seeds, they are not just series A, but we can go at a higher level  because those companies will need sustained power because, you know, they are changing  
**[0:35:54-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:35:54):**  the world.  It's not going to happen overnight.  They will not be profitable overnight.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:36:00):**  And that again requires high conviction.  We have a lot of colleagues, venture capitalists who are dealing at the lower amount level  because it's earlier stage.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:36:13):**  They are doing a fantastic job of nurturing those companies.  There's not enough money going into the next stages, you know, the growth stage.  The growth not in the sense of what people are doing today with more mature industries.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:36:30):**  These are still pioneering industries.  And if it takes another five years for a company to be profitable or another three or four  years, it's really difficult to find today that to fund that gap.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:36:42):**  Ten, 20 million to go or more.  Probably more, like 100 million.  How do you find that today is a challenge for many companies?  
**[0:36:50-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:36:50):**  So we think, you know, this new interest from the very large asset managers for this type  of impact fund, some of them like ours will be channeled to the agri-food space.  This is key for the sector to get there because otherwise we won't be able to fund this transition.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:37:14):**  And what would you tell the private investors that are holding back a bit now?  Let's say we're in a theater and it's a room full of private investors and the smaller  endowments and family offices.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:37:26):**  What would you tell them, obviously we're not giving investment advice, but would you  like to leave when they leave the room, when they leave the theater, what should be the  thought on their mind?  
**[0:37:35-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:37:35):**  Where should they go and dig a bit deeper?  Where should they go and understand more of this space?  What is a good place to start?  
**[0:37:45-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:37:45):**  As you said, we don't want to give investment advice, certainly.  I think the first thing to really realize is regenerative agriculture is going to happen.  Do you like it or not?  
**[0:38:00-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:38:00):**  Because there is no choice.  The good news is what we are seeing right now is you have thousands of really bright  entrepreneurs who were not thinking about that before.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:38:14):**  They were not thinking about, you know, about regenerative agriculture.  They were not thinking about biology that needs to be developed.  They didn't think about mechanical engineering that needs to be developed, about big data  
**[0:38:27-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:38:27):**  that needed to be developed for region ag to become really the mainstream.  Do you see the deal flow now coming?  Do you see also a shift in the investments Aston has been making?  
**[0:38:42-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:38:42):**  Is it getting more into the ag space or the region ag space or has it always been food  plus ag or has it been the themes?  Have they been shifting over the years of investing and thus going forward?  
**[0:38:56-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:38:56):**  I think initially the low-hanging fruits were more on the food side, you know, because it  made a lot of sense and so on.  Ag, we have been trying to do things around that, but there is some fundamental data plays  
**[0:39:14-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:39:14):**  that need to happen for region ag to be on par in terms of profitability from a farmers  level point of view.  The other thing is farmers don't have the money to invest in that, so it needs to come  
**[0:39:29-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:39:29):**  from something else or we need to have the means to point them into a new process, new  form.  The good news and the bad news is there is a huge generational transition happening everywhere  
**[0:39:47-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:39:47):**  in the Western world when it comes to farmers.  So the numbers vary between 50%, 75% in the next 10 years, 15 years in the US, in Canada,  in Western Europe, there will be new farmers.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:40:06):**  I mean, you know, existing farmers will need to retire or will retire and then someone  needs to take over.  So the bad news is many, many, I mean, a large proportion of the children of farmers don't  
**[0:40:23-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:40:23):**  want to become farmers because they've seen the progressive destruction of lifestyle that  this current generation has had, they had a great time regardless of what they were  using in terms of techniques and products and everything until recently, but they have  
**[0:40:44-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:40:44):**  been going down now.  And we might be able to, as a society, I'm not talking about us, those two here on this  table, but we might be able to attract people back into a new form of farming because of  
**[0:40:58-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:40:58):**  technology, because of data driven decisions and so on that will make farming much more  livable.  I'm not even talking about, you know, but you'd be, if you can be in the countryside  
**[0:41:16-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:41:16):**  in nature every day, if that's something you are really attracted to and you don't have  to break your back, you don't have to walk 90 hours a week to make barely minimum wage  and even less, you know, that's not very attractive, but if you can do something better than that,  
**[0:41:35-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:41:35):**  if you can actually have a business model that makes sense.  So we have been working with Hector in France and Audre Boulot, she has done a fantastic  job at modeling, you know, what it takes to make farming again an attractive position,  
**[0:41:57-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:41:57):**  I mean an attractive career proposition.  And I think this is the important thing to realize is we are getting to the point where,  you know, what we see in terms of technologies everywhere, new technologies, new processes  
**[0:42:14-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:42:14):**  is likely to make that happen.  So there are a number of companies out there that are just starting to grasp what needs  to happen and what needs to be delivered to the farmers, to the companies that are buying  
**[0:42:30-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:42:30):**  from farmers, which is very important, the ecosystem, companies that are selling to farmers,  so all this ecosystem needs to adapt.  And to me, looking at the trends and the willingness from a number of people to push that evolution,  
**[0:42:52-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:42:52):**  I think it's going to happen.  So the message is, it will happen, and there are already some really interesting companies  to invest in.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:43:02):**  So the choice is you want to be part of the journey or not, and are you optimistic?  You said it's going to take 15, 20 years, and then you described a number of technologies  and we don't have time to unpack all of them, but are you optimistic at this moment?  
**[0:43:21-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:43:21):**  Yes.  VCs always have to be optimistic.  Otherwise I will do something else, definitely.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:43:29):**  No, I'm okay.  Everyone tells me I'm too optimistic.  They've been telling me that for 25 years.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:43:35):**  I'm right enough times to continue to be optimistic.  I think not every company is going to be succeeding in that space.  It may take longer.  
**[0:43:46-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:43:46):**  Something will go faster than what it was before.  Something will go faster than others.  But I can see this momentum building into what is really the most, you know, the highest  
**[0:44:04-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:44:04):**  reason to be optimistic is to see the level of brainpower that is being poured into that  sector to think about next level solutions in the right direction.  It's unparalleled.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:44:22):**  People who are meeting more and more on a higher frequency basis is really amazing.  So that's what makes me optimistic because when you have this connected brainpower with  the type of technology we have that powers it between biology, synthetic biology, AI,  
**[0:44:44-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:44:44):**  and so on, I cannot tell you about all the projects we are seeing, but some of them are  mind blowing.  And the consumer is starting to shift.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:44:54):**  And then on the other side the consumer is...  Because somebody has to buy this.  We cannot just throw it on lower cost and that will be okay and input costs, et cetera.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:45:02):**  I mean, at least...  Yeah, but if we go back to the very beginning, if you have a, take the US, and you have a  mostly private sector health insurance who are going to die, I mean, these companies,  
**[0:45:17-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:45:17):**  these healthcare companies are all going to go bankrupt if they don't do something.  They're going to move and they're going to mandate a number of things.  They're going to push people, they're going to push enterprises, they're going to push  
**[0:45:28-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:45:28):**  consumers, they're going to push a lot of things to happen.  You think the health angle is the...  The health angle is one of the big ones.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:45:36):**  And the consumers themselves, the younger generation, who...  I think the health angle is going to be the real driver more than environmentally conscious  people which are a big minority, but they are not the majority yet.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:45:54):**  People still think that someone else can take care of that, not them, because they are busy  and they need to take their cars to go somewhere and I fully understand them.  But the health side is going to drive that.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:46:13):**  And I want to be conscious of your time and ask a final question, which is never the final  question, but if you had a magic wand, you could change one thing overnight.  Could be in food and air, could be in general, economy, society, et cetera.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:46:25):**  What would you change?  Have people then say, yeah, which is this, this, this, not one thing.  If you could change only one thing overnight, what would that be?  
**[0:46:35-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:46:35):**  Probably, I think they're not one thing to change.  That's the issue.  It's okay.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:46:43):**  There are so many pieces in the system that need to change and they all are interconnecting  to one another.  I would start with the soil.  
**[0:46:53-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:46:53):**  I would start with the soil.  I would give every farmer a magic wand that says, yeah, now I know that I need to take  care of my soil differently and I have this new toolbox that doesn't cost me more than  
**[0:47:17-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:47:17):**  before that I will be using from now on and that will progressively originate the soil  in Amman.  If you give that to the farmers, they will all say yes because the land, as David Montgomery,  
**[0:47:29-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:47:29):**  I really admire, has been very lucky to have spent quite a bit of time with him personally.  Every farmer knows that the land is the most important part they have, the most important  asset they have, but if they cannot, if it's too expensive for them and too time consuming  
**[0:47:48-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:47:48):**  to do it, they won't be able to do it.  But if I have this magic box, they have this box and now they are putting that on their  tractor and it will regenerate the soil over time.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:47:58):**  I think that's what we should start with.  Everything else will then flow through.  And it's also a mindset piece there for farmers that want to, but might not, like the neighbour  
**[0:48:08-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:48:08):**  you mentioned earlier on, might not want to see or are able literally to see that there  are other ways because if you're stuck in this system for 70 years, it's very difficult  and very confrontational to think that might be something going wrong and to step out of  
**[0:48:28-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:48:28):**  that is for the very few and the stubborn, the crazy, etc.  And not everybody can be there.  So to change the, I think somebody said the most, probably Gabe Brown, the most difficult  
**[0:48:39-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:48:39):**  piece is between the ear, the real estate between your ear to change.  Maybe I'm not quoting him right.  And final question and I really stop.  
**[0:48:48-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:48:48):**  When you go, I don't know if you go often to like regen conferences and not so many,  but when you are in the regen crowd, where are you contrarian?  This is definitely inspired by John Kempf who asked that question, like, where do you  
**[0:49:00-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:49:00):**  think differently or where you don't agree or where others don't agree with you in your  own, in your own bubble, let's say.  When you go there, what's, where do you, where are you contrarian?  
**[0:49:09-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:49:09):**  Is that the machine learning piece or the technology piece?  Is the optimism piece maybe?  Or we need more than a billion to put to work or VC can work here, but what would be the  
**[0:49:18-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:49:18):**  main thing is that I'm actually thinking quite differently than a lot of other people in  regen and I can afford.  Could be a kind of worms.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:49:31):**  No, I think, and again, I invited John Kempf and he came here to Brussels a couple of years  ago.  It was really fun.  
**[0:49:41-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:49:41):**  He's a great character.  And we, I think the idea that people, consumers will actually, majority of them will say,  you know, I make that purchase decision because of environmental, it is bigger for, better  
**[0:50:05-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:50:05):**  for the environment.  I'm not really convinced of that.  I'm not convinced of that.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:50:13):**  You know, it's, I think people, I mean, and again, I'm not sure they will make very easily  a decision about their health.  The big issue we are having, if I stop being totally optimistic for now, for one second,  
**[0:50:30-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:50:30):**  is that when you tell people, wow, you're eating really badly, I'm going to show you  all kinds of different things, you know, your sugar spike and everything and so on.  And people say, oh, okay, that's bad.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:50:44):**  What's going to happen to me?  We say, well, in 25 years, you're going to develop, you know, diabetes or in 35 years,  you'll be dying of at much higher rates of some cardiovascular thing.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:50:58):**  They say, wow, well, that's bad.  Maybe I do something in 20 years.  And for the next 20 years, I don't care.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:51:04):**  I'll continue to eat my-  How do we bring it forward?  So yeah, people, you know, people have been, I mean, people as animals, you know, we have  
**[0:51:15-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:51:15):**  been wired to be extremely efficient at, you know, fleeing immediate danger.  So we are really good at getting a lot of adrenaline and run.  But when you tell someone, you know, stop eating this milkshake every day because, you  
**[0:51:34-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:51:34):**  know, in 10 years or even five years, something bad is going to happen.  We're not really good at dealing with that.  Climate change and sea level rise.  
**[0:51:43-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:51:43):**  Like, stop driving this because in 15, 20, 35 years, maybe, yeah.  It's only when people get exposed to immediate issues.  So big droughts, extreme hail that destroy everything around them.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:52:01):**  When people are exposed to that and they see that it's happening more and more, then suddenly  the climate becomes part of the global discussion.  But it's not yet on the horizon for- It's starting with water for agriculture, but it's  
**[0:52:20-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:52:20):**  not yet on the food and ag space.  People are not yet feeling the real pain, even if- See, when you have 30% of people  or in the Middle East, it's 40 to 60% in some areas of the population who have developed  
**[0:52:36-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:52:36):**  diabetes type 2.  When you get past 50%, it means that every single person knows someone around them that  has that disease, that came from bad food, they are saying to pay attention.  
**[0:52:49-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:52:49):**  So I think we are just getting to the tipping point where things are.  But when you are in these conferences and where people are trying to convince each other  of what they're already convinced of, that's what I'm thinking.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:53:04):**  Maybe we need to think a little bit differently.  What are other people thinking?  I want to be conscious of your time and thank you so much, Eric, for having us here and  
**[0:53:14-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:53:14):**  for sharing.  And of course, good luck in these challenging times to raise a significant fund and hopefully  a few of the institutional ones will not just- Talk is cheap, not just do, oh, we're interested  
**[0:53:28-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:53:28):**  and now we're- But actually follow through, which is way more difficult because you have  to jump through.  I don't know how many institutional hoops to get it signed, but you have experience  
**[0:53:35-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:53:35):**  with that.  So good luck with that and hopefully we have some nice announcements soon.  Thank you, Kon.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:53:47):**  Thank you so much for listening all the way to the end.

**[0:53:58-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:53:58):**  If you liked this episode, why not share it with a friend or give us a rating on Apple  podcast that really helps.  Thanks again and see you next time.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:54:16):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:54:29):**  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  how to put money to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:54:39-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:54:39):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision-making framework?  
**[0:54:49-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:54:49):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:54:57-0:55:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:54:57):**  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  
**[0:55:01-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:55:01):**  How to approach this space for whom is this course?  You the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  
**[0:55:14-0:55:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:55:14):**  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  designers, holistic management consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:55:26-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:55:26):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  et cetera.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:55:37):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:55:41):**  Meaning, I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  
**[0:55:51-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:55:51):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you.  And if you have the means to consider paying what you think it's worth, thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:56:01-0:56:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:56:01):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:56:15):**  So risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:56:26):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:56:40):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:56:45):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/eric-archambeau#t=0:56:56):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.  Click on the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

**[0:01:11-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:01:11):**  In 2020 we'll be launching more Patreon-only content and perks like Ask Me Anything webinars and Q&As with interviewees of the podcast.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:01:20):**  So you can ask all the questions I did not.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:01:23):**  Become a patron with the link in the show notes below.

**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:01:32):**  My current long list contains more than 240 names, but definitely keep sharing them.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:01:37):**  But it's safe to say that I cannot do them all. And even though the Patreon community is growing, podcasts are something I do next to paid work.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:01:44):**  So in the beginning of this year, in 2019, since then I've been trying, but not always succeeding, to focus on the parts within the RegenEgg and food space with the highest potential impact.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:01:55):**  I built and used the decision-making framework to come to the following three themes.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:02:00):**  Nutrient dense food. Technology-enabled landscape design. Payment systems for farmers for ecosystem services.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:02:07):**  And a fourth sort of overarching theme, which is transition finance. So how do we finance the above three themes?  
**[0:02:15-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:02:15):**  If you want to know more about the framework I made to select these subjects, find out more on the website investing in regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:02:23):**  And definitely let me know what you think about it. What did I do wrong? How would you agree or not agree in the comments below or reach out to the website?  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:02:32):**  This is obviously, remember, a very personal list because personal fit weighs quite heavily in this framework.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:02:38):**  So you would probably come up with a different set of priorities. And I'm very interested about it.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:02:43):**  So please let me know. Wishing you an extremely joyful holiday season and looking forward to regenerate much more soils and many more hectares in 2020 and in the next decade. Many thanks.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:02:55):**  And now a deeper dive into the four themes of the RegenEgg and food space. Enjoy!  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:03:00):**  Technology-enabled landscape design. What is needed to take regenerative agriculture to the watershed ecosystem level?  
**[0:03:07-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:03:07):**  To answer the question, what to plant, where and why? Taking into account climate models for the next 20 years, indigenous knowledge, market circumstances and much more.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:03:16):**  A series of interviews with the leading landscape doers, which might make this shift finally possible.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:03:22):**  Look for the playlist on SoundCloud or in the description below. Why is this now possible? Deep learning maybe finally make it possible for network effects in landscape restoration to be able to see those effects and to actually connect those.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:03:35):**  And to answer part of the question, what to plant, where and why for maximum effect?  
**[0:03:41-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:03:41):**  I've done some recent interviews on these, which can be found below with Praza, Landlife Company, WWF Landscape Finance Lab and Zach Wise of Elemental Ecosystems.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:03:51):**  Making nutrients visible. Another huge theme of 2019. How to make nutrient differences visible in regenerative food.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:03:59):**  Will new technologies show the link between healthy soils, healthy produce, healthy gut and healthy people to consumers and investors and thus revolutionize the food and agriculture industry?  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:04:10):**  This is a series of interviews with new technology providers who are promising this over the next, let's say, five years.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:04:16):**  Again, this playlist can be found on SoundCloud or in your favorite podcast app. Why is this now happening? Technology may finally make this instant and affordable and show the relationship with healthy soils.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:04:28):**  Some recent interviews on these, Dan Kittrich of the Bionutrient Food Association and Craig Schumacher of Teak Origin. And stay tuned for 2020 for more interviews on this.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:04:38):**  Payment systems for carbon water storage in healthy soils. Pay farmers for ecosystem services like biodiversity, water storage and carbon storage.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:04:46):**  Paying enough for good nutrient dense food isn't enough for the huge transition needed. Why is this happening now?  
**[0:04:52-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:04:52):**  Blockchain and similar tech plus maybe, maybe markets are finally getting ready to pay for water storage, biodiversity and carbon storage.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:05:01):**  Obviously, we don't know when this is going to happen. Some recent interviews on this, Tony Lovell of SLM Partners and Paul Chatterton of WWF Landscape Finance Lab.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:05:10):**  And then transition finance, transition finance, which is needed to finance this huge transition mentioned above.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/10/what-we-learn-in-2019-about-investing-in-regenerative-agriculture-and-food/#t=0:05:16):**  How funds, investment vehicles are stepping in to finance these transitions in companies and on farms.

**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:13):**  You're going to listen to an interview with Eric Jackson of Pipeline Foods, where we are  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:17):**  discussing large scale conversion of land to organic farming.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:22):**  What holds farmers back while the demand is growing so rapidly?  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:25):**  Eric could have retired but decided to dive into regenerative agriculture and get as many  
**[0:00:29-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:29):**  acres as possible on the journey to be a positive force instead of a negative one.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:35):**  Learn how he built an organization of over 50 people in 18 months, projected to do 150  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:40):**  million in sales this year.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:44):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:45):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:49):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:51):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:55):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:00):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:05):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:07):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:11):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:13):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:18):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:23):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:27):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:30):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:33):**  Share more interviews, there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:37):**  food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:39):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:43):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:48):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:53):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:00):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:03):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:04):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:08):**  I'm Koen Van Zeyer, your host, and today I'm talking to Erik Jackson, the CEO of Pipeline  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:12):**  Foods, working to accelerate the availability of organic, non-GMO, regenerative grown food  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:17):**  to the market by working together with the whole value chain.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:20):**  I have a lot of questions around how they put farmers first and what regenerative agriculture  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:25):**  means to them.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:26):**  So let's not lose time and dive straight in.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:28):**  Welcome Erik!  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:29):**  Hi, very nice to be here.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:31):**  So to start with a personal question which I always love.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:34):**  What brings you to building soil, regenerative agriculture and using agriculture as a force  
**[0:02:41-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:41):**  for good?  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:42):**  Very, very big question I know.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:44):**  Yeah, well, like many folks my age who've been in agriculture for a career, when we  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:53):**  started in the business, in my case 35 years ago, we were never given any information and  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:59):**  that really wasn't the topic of conversation about how agriculture and sustainability could  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:05):**  work together.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:06):**  In fact, sustainability had yet to be sort of raised as a business proposition or as  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:11):**  a mandate by consumers.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:14):**  So you go through your career in the conventional space and in my case I had the opportunity  
**[0:03:20-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:20):**  to retire in 2007 and I took that opportunity to move out of the direct involvement in the  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:28):**  agricultural trading business and get into the carbon sequestration business through  
**[0:03:34-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:34):**  the Chicago Climate Exchange and the programs around cover cropping and grasslands, minimum  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:43):**  tillage programs.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:45):**  And it was really through that two years or so that I was doing that business that I started  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:49):**  to connect some dots that I didn't really even think about prior to that.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:55):**  So this would be now almost 12 years ago.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:01):**  When we started taking a look at carbon sequestration and the possibilities for using agriculture  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:06):**  as a carbon sink, you know, the forest projects had been already been used for quite a while  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:12):**  but agriculture, particularly production agriculture as a carbon sink was something that was relatively  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:19):**  new even across the sustainability community at that point in time.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:24):**  And I've got a commercial mindset.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:27):**  I'm not really a scientific person but I do have a set of personal values that I found  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:34):**  that were in alignment with this idea of creating food in a way that also had these secondary  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:40):**  and tertiary environmental benefits primarily.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:43):**  There are some social benefits as well but I really got hooked on this notion of linking  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:51):**  environmental outcomes to food production.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:53):**  And do you remember when if there was a light bulb moment or a farmer you visited when with  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:59):**  your traditional agriculture background you suddenly saw like, wait a minute, it could  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:05):**  not just be less bad but actually it could be more positive effects as well.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:11):**  Was there a specific moment or was it more like those two years like you mentioned before?  
**[0:05:15-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:15):**  Yeah, it was mostly a slow process but there were times when I was out in fields, enormous  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:23):**  fields out in the northern part of the US.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:28):**  You know, I grew up in Illinois where everything was black dirt and the farmers prided themselves  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:35):**  on how clean their fields were before they planted them, how clean their fields were  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:40):**  during the season through the use of pesticides and herbicides.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:43):**  And it seemed natural to me of course.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:45):**  A clean system is a, you know, a clean looking system must be a better system.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:49):**  And then I went to these projects in North Dakota and Montana and Wyoming and I started  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:56):**  seeing a different type of agriculture.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:59):**  Very messy one.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:00):**  Yeah, much more messy.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:02):**  This was actually not organic that I was looking at at that point in time but it was this idea  
**[0:06:08-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:08):**  of using nature as part of the cycle instead of fighting nature in between the times when  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:17):**  we want to use the land to grow a crop and, you know, the balance of the year.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:23):**  So you have the fallow period post harvest and using cover cropping during that post  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:29):**  harvest period.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:30):**  The dirt was healthier, you know, and this was the description of the growers telling  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:35):**  me that they noticed that their dirt was getting better as they were using cover crops.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:41):**  The idea of using minimum tillage in concert with nature as opposed to fighting nature  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:49):**  every step of the way during the growing season was producing every bit as much yield for  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:55):**  these guys as conventional and their cost structure was much lower because they weren't  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:01):**  using, they weren't having to buy all these inputs.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:05):**  So that was sort of an aha moment for me because I was a believer at that point in time that  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:12):**  you had to fertilize and you had to hammer the earth with things to keep it in check  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:17):**  so that we could do what we wanted to do during the growing season at least in the northern  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:22):**  hemisphere.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:24):**  But I would say mostly it was an accretive process.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:26):**  You know, it was learning mostly through stories by listening to growers talk about what they  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:31):**  were doing and changes that they saw.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:34):**  Multi-generational farms, you know, that would do something for a long period of time the  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:40):**  same year after year and then they recognized that some of the things that their grandfather  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:45):**  used to do was actually better.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:47):**  But, you know, they had to go through a change in the mindset.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:50):**  They, farmers as a rule I would say have to learn by doing and they have to be taught  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:58):**  through lessons on their own land.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:00):**  But it was really more of an accumulated process of listening to these growers as they went  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:07):**  through different changes, tried different things, very experimental to try to, you know,  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:14):**  at the very least earn environmental credits for what they were doing.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:18):**  But then they noticed something good was really happening so it became more than a monetary  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:24):**  endeavor and became, you know, more of a missional type endeavor for many of these growers.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:29):**  So I really learned from the farmers the benefits, the much broader set of benefits of doing  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:35):**  things I would say in the non-conventional way.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:39):**  And then when you, when basically the market of compensation didn't really take off in  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:45):**  the US or North America, what made you, I mean that sort of forced you to switch but  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:50):**  you could still retire, what made you found and start Pipeline Foods?  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:55):**  Well there's actually a chapter in between.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:59):**  So from 07 to 09, 2007 to 2009 I was involved in the carbon sequestration projects and then  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:07):**  I took another sort of detour and I got involved in the software business.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:13):**  And the idea was to build a business software platform for large scale farmers, part of  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:19):**  which was to give them better control over their, over the economics of their business  
**[0:09:25-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:25):**  and part of it was to give them more visibility into how sustainability practices impacted  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:32):**  their bottom line.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:34):**  And then to give them the opportunity through the use of data to be able to participate  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:39):**  in sustainability programs whether they were driven by their buyers or whether they were  
**[0:09:46-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:46):**  driven by governmental or NGO initiatives, either regulatory or non-regulatory.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:54):**  So the thing I was connecting in my head at that point was the data was critical to respond  
**[0:10:01-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:01):**  to market forces, some of which would be regulatory in nature, mostly around water quality and  
**[0:10:08-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:08):**  some of them would be market based in nature mostly around addressing interest coming  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:15):**  from the consumer side in terms of knowing where your food came from and the practices  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:19):**  used to raise that.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:20):**  So I spent 8 years in the software industry building that platform which is called Conservice  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:26):**  and that is still a going business.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:28):**  And that was quite exciting because I learned something new again that I didn't know really  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:35):**  much about technology before I got into that business and I was the agricultural expert  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:40):**  in on the team and I started to learn a lot about how technology could play a positive  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:46):**  role through the use of data management in terms of exposing best practices as well as  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:52):**  connecting farmers to market opportunities and or giving them a response to a regulatory  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:59):**  pressure from their environment.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:11:01):**  So that was a long intermediate chapter of 8 years and it was really through that process  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:11:07):**  then again I spent virtually all of that 8 years mostly out in the field with growers  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:11:13):**  and started seeing a whole wide variety of different types of growing schemes and started  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:11:20):**  bumping in more and more to folks that were at least diversified into organic row crop  
**[0:11:26-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:11:26):**  production and so my education of production agriculture, different types of production  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:11:33):**  agriculture continued during those software years.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:11:37):**  So then I got bored again.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:11:39):**  There's a common theme here, when I get bored I get dangerous.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:11:43):**  I didn't want to say it.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:11:45):**  So in late 2015 I started sort of dreaming about maybe how to get more deeply involved  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:11:54):**  in specifically in the organic space which I would say, we will talk about this a little  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:12:00):**  bit more later, but organic is one of the ways in which regenerative agriculture might  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:12:04):**  be expressed.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:12:06):**  I was looking at the marketplace and watching the growth in the industry, double digit growth  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:12:14):**  year over year for many, many years and again with my commercial hat on I was wondering  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:12:19):**  what had been, what was being done in terms of the infrastructure.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:12:22):**  And the supply.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:12:25):**  So the midstream between the farmer and the consumer, there's a lot of steps that happen  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:12:29):**  and I was fascinated to try to figure out and see if that infrastructure had been keeping  
**[0:12:36-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:12:36):**  up with the whole marketplace and I found out that it was really an under invested space.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:12:43):**  I'm talking about grain elevators, grain processing, feed manufacturing, grain processing for various  
**[0:12:51-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:12:51):**  types of foodstuffs, food ingredients and really that's a critical link because neither  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:12:59):**  the demand side or the supply side can function without that midstream.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:13:04):**  And so I thought okay well maybe my contribution to this effort is to develop the midstream  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:13:10):**  so that both sides of this, of the pipeline, there's a name, that's where it came from,  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:13:17):**  both sides of the pipe can benefit if the pipe is built in such a way that it honors  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:13:22):**  the desires on the demand side and honors the desires on the supply side.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:13:27):**  So this notion of building a pipe, the most efficient means by which to get product from  
**[0:13:32-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:13:32):**  A to B started coming into view and I started putting a team together in early 16 to explore  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:13:41):**  this a little bit more and we spent about six months doing some research and developing  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:13:47):**  the thesis more clearly and then I stepped out into the capital markets to raise money  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:13:52):**  because the midstream business is very asset heavy and it takes a lot of capital to put  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:13:58):**  the pieces together.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:14:00):**  So that's sort of the condensed version.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:14:03):**  I could go on for hours about other aspects of it but that's sort of the condensed version  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:14:08):**  of how I came to form a pipeline as a company.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:14:13):**  And now you have, I counted on the website, over 50 people working with you and can you  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:14:19):**  give the condensed version of what pipeline foods, obviously changing constantly, but  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:14:24):**  what it is today, what you focus on, what's your theory of change?  
**[0:14:29-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:14:29):**  Yeah, so again consistent with the initial thesis that somebody or somebodies had to  
**[0:14:36-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:14:36):**  take out their checkbook and start investing in the midstream so that the product from  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:14:43):**  the farm can reach the consumer.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:14:45):**  And if you don't have that midstream in place then neither side gets to do as well as they  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:14:51):**  could.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:14:52):**  So today after not quite 18 months in business we have headquarters here in Minneapolis,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:14:59):**  we have a team in Canada that manages our Canadian program, we have a team in Buenos  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:15:04):**  Aires that manages our South American program and we've created a partnership with a like  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:15:10):**  minded group out of Europe that gives us a global program in terms of being able to work  
**[0:15:17-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:15:17):**  directly with growers today in about 20 countries to be able to number one get them the best  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:15:26):**  price possible for the products they're producing and then on the other side working with consumer  
**[0:15:31-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:15:31):**  groups, consumer companies, people that put branded product on the food shelf to take  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:15:40):**  their sustainability programs and be able to express those back to the farmers so that  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:15:46):**  those farmers who choose to participate in those programs sort of have a translator to  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:15:51):**  get them there because the food companies have a challenge in terms of their sustainability  
**[0:15:58-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:15:58):**  programs and how the promises they've made to their stakeholders and to their customers.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:16:04):**  Most food companies don't directly touch the farm and most midstream groups that are sitting  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:16:10):**  in the same position in the universe as pipeline don't have an interest in making that connection.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:16:16):**  They operate in a black box model where actually their stock in trade is not…  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:16:22):**  The less you know the more I can exploit you.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:16:26):**  No information shared so we took the exact opposite approach and said well that's not  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:16:30):**  what the consumer wants, we know that there are some farmers that would like to participate  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:16:35):**  downstream and understand what the consumer wants while the consumers want to participate  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:16:39):**  upstream and understand how their food is grown.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:16:43):**  So we said let's be completely transparent and create sort of a two-way telescope consistent  
**[0:16:48-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:16:48):**  with the thesis of a pipe I guess and give both visibility to each other and strengthen  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:16:56):**  the food system in a way that hasn't really been done at least at a commercial scale before.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:17:02):**  So again today like you said we have somewhere in the neighborhood of just over 50 people.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:17:11):**  We have four grain elevators, two in Saskatchewan and two in North Dakota.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:17:18):**  We have a small oil seed crushing operation in Missouri.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:17:23):**  We are exploring more elevators, exploring feed milling for animal feed for the organic  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:17:29):**  dairy sector in particular.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:17:33):**  We're looking at elevators and grain processing facilities in Argentina and we again through  
**[0:17:40-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:17:40):**  our European partnership we've got projects in Kazakhstan, Uganda, Malaysia and various  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:17:48):**  other areas around the world.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:17:52):**  All follow the same trajectory where we say we have boots on the ground.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:17:57):**  So we are not simply buying and selling product but we are actually actively working with  
**[0:18:01-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:18:01):**  the growers to try to help them improve their opportunity as well as to give our customers  
**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:18:08):**  assurance that the products that they receive are in fact from this particular farm or this  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:18:15):**  particular region of farms.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:18:17):**  So it's a very intensive business.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:18:19):**  It does take more labor, more arms and legs than your traditional business but so far  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:18:26):**  the market signals are telling us that we're doing the right thing.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:18:29):**  And in terms of a concrete example let's say I'm a grain farmer and maybe I'm already organic  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:18:35):**  or maybe I'm thinking about and I knock on the door of pipeline food.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:18:41):**  What would be our journey?  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:18:43):**  Yeah, so in the case let's say that you do not have any organic production but you've  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:18:50):**  been dreaming about it.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:18:52):**  The three challenges…  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:18:53):**  I've seen my neighbors doing it and I wanted to.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:18:57):**  I would like my children to come back to the farm and they didn't want to at the moment.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:01):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:02):**  That is very much about the next generation in many cases.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:06):**  But there are three primary challenges for embarking on the journey and we've consistently  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:12):**  uncovered these to the point that we're convinced these are the three sort of hurdles that have  
**[0:19:17-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:17):**  to be overcome.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:19):**  One is economic uncertainty.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:21):**  There's a three-year period.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:23):**  For the US organic program there's a three-year transition period.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:27):**  So you have to do…  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:28):**  I think it's exactly the same here.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:30):**  So you have to do three times 365 days of agriculture that includes no prohibited applications  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:41):**  of materials.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:43):**  So during that period of time there aren't very many market opportunities to get a better  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:49):**  price for your products.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:51):**  You're essentially still selling into the conventional market but you're doing everything  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:19:56):**  different on your farm as a farmer.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:20:00):**  And so normally during that transition period you have some yield drag as you're learning  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:20:06):**  the new system and you don't have a better economic opportunity.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:20:09):**  So the first challenge is the economic peace and out of that then your traditional lenders  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:20:18):**  may or may not be willing to support that.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:20:22):**  So we put together a toolkit of third-party partners from the banking side.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:20:29):**  We continue to discover more and more bankers that are interested and willing to sponsor  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:20:35):**  if you will this transitional period.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:20:37):**  To finance I guess, right?  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:20:40):**  Exactly, transition finance.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:20:42):**  We also have put together and continue to add to a portfolio agronomic support tools.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:20:48):**  We ourselves are not agronomists.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:20:51):**  We do not pretend to be but we do have one agroecologist on the team whose primary job  
**[0:20:58-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:20:58):**  is to identify agronomic support organizations or individuals in various places that can  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:21:05):**  be brought to bear in support of the grower who's embarking on this journey.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:21:11):**  And then the third piece is a long-term view of the market because it's one thing to get  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:21:17):**  through the transition but then there's still the question of where am I going to sell my  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:21:22):**  organic product and what sort of prices am I going to get for it.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:21:27):**  So this is primary to our business.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:21:30):**  We are able to put together a framework that supports the post-transition world.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:21:39):**  Now that you are organic and now that you are producing organic, then we can provide  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:21:43):**  the market access through our day-to-day business model.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:21:47):**  So putting all that together into a package that we can sit down and talk to an aspiring  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:21:53):**  organic farmer, that would be the journey that we would embark on with you.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:22:00):**  Now if you're existing organic, a little different approach, the thing that we look for with  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:22:09):**  the existing organic growers in addition to doing business with them here and now is to  
**[0:22:15-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:22:15):**  explore whether they're interested in expanding their opportunity, their acreage.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:22:22):**  And oftentimes the answer is yes, but I don't want to or I can't buy more land.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:22:27):**  So we are matching landowners with farmers who want to expand and essentially helping  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:22:35):**  them put together long-term arrangements, normally seven to ten year arrangements that  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:22:42):**  are sympathetic to the organic thesis in terms of the lease structure.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:22:47):**  And again, we stand there as the market maker for the product so that the landowner has  
**[0:22:53-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:22:53):**  confidence that the farmer will have the means by which to pay them.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:23:01):**  There are landowners increasingly that are more and more concerned about how their land  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:23:07):**  is managed and so this is sympathetic to their view as well.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:23:13):**  So with existing organic growers, we look to help them expand by connecting them to  
**[0:23:19-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:23:19):**  landowners that have an interest in the organic regenerative sustainability thesis overall.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:23:27):**  But it's a lot of education on both sides because a lot of people know the words but  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:23:32):**  they don't really necessarily completely understand the meaning.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:23:37):**  So we're teachers, every day we're teachers out in the marketplace.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:23:42):**  And just to unpack that a bit because you provide long-term agreements etc. for me that  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:23:49):**  when I'm through that journey because I'm going to be organic to basically make sure  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:23:55):**  I have off-take agreements etc.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:23:57):**  I read somewhere you're buying the whole rotation because as an organic farmer I'm going to  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:24:01):**  rotate probably quite a bit.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:24:03):**  Does it mean also livestock or is it basically the grain and seeds etc. rotation that I'm  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:24:10):**  going to grow from year now but from year four or five etc. are officially organic?  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:24:15):**  It's the grains.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:24:16):**  So the livestock side is a very interesting, can be a very interesting piece.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:24:22):**  We do have some of our farmers that are using livestock really as the transitional crop.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:24:27):**  Yeah I see a lot of people experimenting with it.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:24:30):**  Yeah it's a very interesting concept.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:24:33):**  We ourselves do not get directly involved in the trade of meat, milk or eggs.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:24:43):**  So our concentration is really on those crops that are, I mean nothing is completely non-perishable.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:24:51):**  That's the market that we try to stay with.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:24:52):**  There are things that can be stored for a long time.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:24:55):**  They may require some special handling and care but they are not, we do not deal with  
**[0:25:01-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:25:01):**  meat, milk, eggs, produce, fruit or any of the fresh to table products.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:25:08):**  And on the already organic farmers that want to expand and you help them basically getting  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:25:16):**  proper lease agreements on other land, how does that work?  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:25:21):**  Do they get any, do they capture at all the value they create by regenerating that land  
**[0:25:27-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:25:27):**  probably going to organic or going beyond organic?  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:25:30):**  Because I see a lot of opportunity there and a lot of tension at the same time because  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:25:35):**  you are basically helping somebody else's asset grow.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:25:38):**  And what do you see in terms of developments on that side?  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:25:42):**  A great question.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:25:44):**  So we talk to people across the value chain in agriculture and everybody, well unless  
**[0:25:51-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:25:51):**  you are against organic, there are still plenty of people that are fundamentally against organic,  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:25:59):**  you know from an academic perspective, from an intellectual perspective understand of  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:26:03):**  course that you are building soil health and you are increasing pollinator habitat and  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:26:08):**  biodiversity and improving water quality.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:26:11):**  But the valorization of that, all those good things is still very, very immature.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:26:21):**  And what I mean by that is that the idea that land would trade for a higher value once it  
**[0:26:27-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:26:27):**  has been converted to organic should be supported by the economics associated with being an  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:26:35):**  organic farmer which is, at least in our part of the world or the parts of the world that  
**[0:26:40-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:26:40):**  we operate in, our farmers make a lot more money per acre than their conventional neighbors.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:26:47):**  And that should be what drives land value, but there hasn't been enough organic, organically  
**[0:26:52-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:26:52):**  certified land change hands to positively prove that thesis.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:27:01):**  Maybe everybody likes to hold on it.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:27:03):**  Well quite frankly the flip side of the same discussion is there is concern about, okay  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:27:12):**  if you are not doing traditional weed control and if you are not doing traditional fertilization,  
**[0:27:17-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:27:17):**  maybe you are actually mining my soil and you are going to give me back a weedy patch.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:27:24):**  So there is still some tension in that whole proposition about being able to monetize,  
**[0:27:33-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:27:33):**  valorize the actual improvement in the soil itself.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:27:41):**  It's again, intellectually everybody understands it, but we are just too young in the practice  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:27:48):**  yet to be able to positively affirm the marketplace has not come, for the land anyway, has not  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:27:54):**  come along as quickly as the marketplace for the product.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:27:58):**  And actually you touched upon a very interesting point as well when you mentioned the three  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:28:03):**  pieces of the toolbox basically you are using.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:28:06):**  I think you highlighted somewhere in one of the documentations a fourth as well which  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:28:10):**  comes back to this point and I am quoting here, perhaps one of the hardest parts of  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:28:14):**  this journey is to walk into a local coffee shop and getting a cold shoulder for doing  
**[0:28:19-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:28:19):**  something different.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:28:20):**  How do you work on that psychology piece that I am going to be the weird one in the village  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:28:26):**  and the community because I am going organic and I am going to have a very messy field?  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:28:31):**  That's the hardest part for us to address directly.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:28:37):**  We're not running a social agency here and we're not running a psychological agency.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:28:45):**  One of the things that we are starting to do, again being a young company we had to  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:28:50):**  do things in a particular order, but one of the things that we are starting to do is to  
**[0:28:54-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:28:54):**  create a community and connecting various farmers to each other, giving them the opportunity  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:29:03):**  to understand that although they may be odd in the local coffee shop, in the global coffee  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:29:08):**  shop they are not that odd.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:29:11):**  Having those connections to other farmers who have been through this journey and have  
**[0:29:15-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:29:15):**  come out the other side and are successful, that level of support obviously we can't force  
**[0:29:22-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:29:22):**  it on people but we are creating those connections both to help the new farmer from a transitional  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:29:30):**  standpoint, sometimes the best mentor for them as an existing organic farmer, but also  
**[0:29:35-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:29:35):**  to give them a community that they can interact with either over the phone or through events.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:29:44):**  We have a lot of field days for example during the summer, we're very actively involved in  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:29:48):**  that right now where we convene communities of growers that some of them know each other  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:29:55):**  but some of them don't and giving them a chance to form a peer group if you will between themselves  
**[0:30:02-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:30:02):**  in order to establish the fact that they aren't maybe quite as odd as some of the local folks  
**[0:30:11-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:30:11):**  might treat them.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:30:12):**  It is very interesting when you find somebody who broke ranks a number of years ago and  
**[0:30:17-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:30:17):**  went organic a number of years ago and now they are successful, all of a sudden they  
**[0:30:24-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:30:24):**  are not the odd one anymore but they are the one that is sought after.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:30:27):**  There is a period of time, maybe three to five years where you may have this feeling  
**[0:30:33-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:30:33):**  of isolation but if you are successful, particularly in the farming community, then you become  
**[0:30:40-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:30:40):**  admired.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:30:41):**  You have to sort of go through the valley of death.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:30:46):**  The yield drag is also your reputation drag.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:30:49):**  Yes, right.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:30:51):**  That's what the coffee shop is all about.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:30:53):**  Everybody tells a story about the fishing trip in the form of yields, how big things  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:30:59):**  are and how much they sold it for and blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:31:02):**  Never on the input side of things.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:31:04):**  Yes, right.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:31:05):**  But you are right, that is a very complicated piece of this and quite frankly probably the  
**[0:31:13-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:31:13):**  least discussed but probably the most real barrier when a grower starts thinking about  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:31:23):**  going in this direction and he starts socializing the idea with his neighbors and his neighbors  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:31:27):**  all react negatively.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:31:28):**  Oftentimes, then the grower just goes back to what they were doing before and it is easier.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:31:38):**  We can't conquer the world.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:31:40):**  We have to find those bright spots where we can be successful.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:31:43):**  I see a lot of parallels with the impact investing space which is clearly booming but in many  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:31:49):**  countries there are only a few that actually see their portfolio and their investments  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:31:54):**  and their family office as a potential to actually be a force for good and actually  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:00):**  invest, get return and be able to sleep at night and not having to worry that your money  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:06):**  is invested in certain pipelines that aren't so sustainable.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:10):**  If you are the only one or the first one to start there, mainly your family is very worried  
**[0:32:14-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:14):**  they are going to lose a lot of return.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:17):**  Your friends probably say why don't you buy a boat and go sailing and so it is a very  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:21):**  lonely field until you discover peer groups which luckily start to happen in a lot of  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:26):**  places because the tools are there to transition the journey to clean up your portfolio to  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:30):**  actually invest it in very deep impact or lighter impact, etc.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:34):**  That is all there.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:35):**  The main question is are you able to do that journey which might take like an organic 3,  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:42):**  5 or 10 could take quite a long time but you need that support group because it is not  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:46):**  easy being the only one walking to the right when everybody is walking to the left.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:51):**  That is a very good parallel example.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:54):**  I fully agree.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:32:57):**  At a personal level we made the transition several years ago to first start taking things  
**[0:33:04-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:33:04):**  out of our portfolio.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:33:05):**  That is kind of the first step.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:33:09):**  First step I would say is looking at what is in it because most people actually don't  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:33:12):**  know to the full detail level if you have outsourced part of it.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:33:17):**  First for us at a personal level is finding an advisor.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:33:22):**  Finding an advisor that knew the journey and that could help us think through and demonstrate  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:33:27):**  to us, help us figure out what it is we really cared about and what we really wanted to accomplish  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:33:32):**  over what period of time and with what risk return profile and etc.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:33:39):**  To a certain degree we kind of play that advisory role in the business that we are in.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:33:45):**  I don't want to overemphasize that point.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:33:49):**  We speak with impact investors all the time.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:33:51):**  I have been contacted by a long stream of folks that are somewhere on the continuum.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:33:58):**  I would say that even our first investor, our initial investor, although they weren't  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:34:04):**  well organized around ESG theme, their LPs, this is a private equity group, their LPs  
**[0:34:11-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:34:11):**  were increasingly asking them to analyze their portfolio of investments as a GP and start  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:34:20):**  grading their investment portfolio along certain ESG frameworks.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:34:26):**  We have actually been helping our primary financial sponsor understand what this means  
**[0:34:31-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:34:31):**  at an operating company level and have helped them create their ESG policy and now they  
**[0:34:38-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:34:38):**  have hired at least one person full time for that endeavor internally.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:34:45):**  They themselves are in transition between what I would consider to be a conventional  
**[0:34:49-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:34:49):**  investment shop and a more ESG driven investment shop.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:34:56):**  But there are some much more pure impact investment groups.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:35:01):**  Many times they are in the form of a family office who have come to us specifically along  
**[0:35:08-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:35:08):**  those lines and they understand that we are not ourselves the agricultural producer but  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:35:15):**  once they understand the critical link that we are providing that makes it possible for  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:35:19):**  these agricultural practices to find a commercial return and they connect those dots we become  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:35:26):**  a very interesting opportunity.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:35:28):**  So I have those conversations all the time.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:35:31):**  That's an important part of what we think our future is.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:35:34):**  Yeah, because let's dive into that a bit.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:35:38):**  You have only been around with this company, you have been around a lot more, about 18  
**[0:35:43-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:35:43):**  months.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:35:44):**  What about the rest of, it's now June 2018, what does the rest of 2018 look like?  
**[0:35:48-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:35:48):**  What are the main exciting projects you can share obviously?  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:35:54):**  Yeah, well it's actually relatively simple.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:35:58):**  So we are in the northern hemisphere anyway, we are already done planting essentially.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:36:05):**  So the work that we did prior to planting was to organize as many farm based contracts  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:36:11):**  as we could and to go through a planning process with the organic farmers to help them understand  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:36:17):**  what the opportunities were for the various crops that could be grown in their area.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:36:21):**  To your earlier point about rotation, rotation is a much more important part of the organic  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:36:29):**  framework than it is the conventional framework.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:36:32):**  So you have sort of two different decision horizons.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:36:36):**  One is an agronomic horizon, i.e. what should I be doing agronomically in order to optimize  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:36:42):**  not just this year but the next several years in my system.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:36:46):**  And then right alongside that is the economic piece.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:36:51):**  Okay what will it cost me or how much can I make?  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:36:55):**  So it's a matrix type decision approach and we get to sit with the growers and do that.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:37:00):**  So that's all done now in the northern hemisphere.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:37:03):**  We're embarking on that in our South American operations right now for the winter season  
**[0:37:08-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:37:08):**  down there.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:37:11):**  So now a bit of it is sit and wait because the crops are growing.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:37:18):**  We're working with customers primarily right now to help arrange their supply chains for  
**[0:37:24-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:37:24):**  the upcoming harvest.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:37:26):**  And because of the assets that we purchased we're still doing some basic capital projects  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:37:33):**  work to improve those assets and make them a little bit better than they were necessarily  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:37:39):**  when we bought them.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:37:40):**  And we're always talking to people across the value chain about additional acquisitions.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:37:48):**  Today so far that has not meant additional companies that we are buying that have strictly  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:37:52):**  been assets but we are certainly in the market for acquisition opportunities.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:37:58):**  Being as young as we are we're still struggling a bit with just some basic internal infrastructure  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:38:03):**  with accounting systems and things like that.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:38:05):**  So still getting that sharpened up is important.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:38:10):**  Our fiscal year ends at the end of June.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:38:12):**  So taking stock of what milestones we met or exceeded or missed and doing the planning  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:38:22):**  for the upcoming year.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:38:25):**  But when you're in agriculture you – if you're in agriculture in a single hemisphere  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:38:30):**  you really have one cycle a year.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:38:34):**  So agriculture is maddeningly slow in the sense that it's not a factory where you can  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:38:42):**  run down and turn a knob every five minutes and make adjustments.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:38:46):**  You have one time a year to get things done and you have to accept that cadence as a fact.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:38:51):**  It's a little bit different because we have operations in the north and south hemisphere  
**[0:38:55-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:38:55):**  so we get to do this twice a year.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:38:57):**  But nonetheless there are certain realities that you simply can't change.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:39:00):**  So you have to – you get into this cadence of plan, plant, grow, harvest, handle, ship,  
**[0:39:11-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:39:11):**  wash, rinse and repeat.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:39:14):**  That's just the nature of the business.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:39:17):**  So there's no real big exciting projects this year.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:39:21):**  We've got a couple of assets that we're looking at to expand our footprint.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:39:26):**  But our program development work particularly on the farm – what we call our Farm Profit  
**[0:39:32-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:39:32):**  Program which is our farm facing program goes on year round because once we get into post  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:39:38):**  planting then we start having these field day events and community building events and  
**[0:39:43-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:39:43):**  things like that.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:39:44):**  So that's – it's not mundane by any means but it's not – it's incrementally improving  
**[0:39:52-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:39:52):**  what we've already started.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:39:53):**  I guess that's the best way to describe it.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:39:55):**  It's a good rhythm and in terms of what means regenerative agriculture for pipeline  
**[0:40:01-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:40:01):**  foods and what are your plans in that?  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:40:04):**  You've mentioned organic is a way to express that.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:40:08):**  Can you expand on that a bit?  
**[0:40:10-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:40:10):**  So the term regenerative in the commercial sense is really very new.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:40:19):**  Now if you go back to Rodale Institute many, many years ago the term was being used but  
**[0:40:26-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:40:26):**  it wasn't being used as a commercial label.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:40:28):**  And really the power of a market to make change is when you can connect the demand side to  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:40:35):**  the supply side because the primary exchange is money.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:40:40):**  And without money the universe of participants shrinks to only those who are mission driven  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:40:48):**  which is important but in my mind not sufficient.  
**[0:40:53-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:40:53):**  So we're trying to figure out how the signals are going to get sent if you will.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:41:00):**  And regenerative is a relatively new signal in the commercial world.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:41:04):**  We have a regenerative organic certificate now that some food companies are considering  
**[0:41:12-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:41:12):**  adopting which is sort of organic plus.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:41:15):**  The organic community itself is fracturing a little bit from those who think that the  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:41:21):**  current regulatory environment is sufficient and those who think that it falls short of  
**[0:41:27-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:41:27):**  meeting their own personal aspirations to be more environmentally friendly, more socially  
**[0:41:35-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:41:35):**  responsible, and have a higher degree of governance over their business.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:41:41):**  But this conversation about regenerative as a commercial communication tool upstream and  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:41:48):**  downstream on the value chain is still new.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:41:52):**  Our approach at this point is a little bit of a wait and see not because individually  
**[0:41:57-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:41:57):**  as people we aren't sympathetic to many of the ideals expressed in regenerative conversation.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:42:06):**  But again if the market signal does not turn into a commercial opportunity we believe that  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:42:16):**  the outcome is going to be too small to be measured.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:42:21):**  So the commercial signal can come in many different ways.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:42:25):**  Consumers are certainly the preferred mode but it can also come through the investment  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:42:29):**  community because the investment community has the opportunity to use money again to  
**[0:42:34-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:42:34):**  incentivize certain behaviors and you do not even need to have somebody who is mission  
**[0:42:41-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:42:41):**  oriented to stare at a monetary opportunity.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:42:49):**  I tell my team at some level we shouldn't care about motivation as long as the outcomes  
**[0:42:54-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:42:54):**  are aligned with our business philosophy and our ethos.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:42:59):**  So if a person, if a grower for example is solely motivated by money and that's the way  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:43:05):**  that we can get that grower to behave in a different way that creates an economic opportunity  
**[0:43:10-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:43:10):**  for the grower and an abundance of additional environmental outcomes, we shouldn't care.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:43:17):**  We shouldn't be so altruistic that we need for the growers to stand up and salute some  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:43:25):**  sort of flag or some sort of icon.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:43:29):**  We should really care about the outcomes of the endeavor.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:43:32):**  And so that's sort of where we are in the regenerative journey because it's still a  
**[0:43:37-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:43:37):**  very new concept commercially even while we feel, I would say most of us anyway who work  
**[0:43:44-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:43:44):**  here feel very strongly personally that the notion of regenerative certainly makes sense  
**[0:43:51-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:43:51):**  and if the marketplace can at least align with that concept and certainly not penalize  
**[0:44:00-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:44:00):**  but if there's a reward system associated with it then we stand ready to use that as  
**[0:44:06-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:44:06):**  another way to create good outcomes at the farm level.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:44:14):**  But it's a tricky, regenerative is tricky right now because it is so new.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:44:21):**  And do you see, I imagine that within your group of farmers you have an enormous spectrum  
**[0:44:28-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:44:28):**  that some folks have been doing it for a long time and are maybe pushing the boundaries  
**[0:44:33-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:44:33):**  or are really going beyond organic quite a while ago.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:44:37):**  Do you see them going into even more complex rotations, adding, I mean we've discussed  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:44:43):**  livestock a bit but tree cropping into it etc. also doing things that are not part of  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:44:48):**  your ecosystem and do you see them going beyond organic?  
**[0:44:53-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:44:53):**  You know in the North American and South American commercial agricultural areas the answer is  
**[0:45:00-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:45:00):**  no.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:45:02):**  We do see some of that in areas that we don't necessarily practice in at this point.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:45:06):**  So at the small holder level where oftentimes there may be a corporate entity involved that  
**[0:45:12-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:45:12):**  is deeply concerned for example about their raw material supply of cocoa or chocolate  
**[0:45:22-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:45:22):**  or something more exotic that's typically not grown in a well-developed area, those  
**[0:45:28-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:45:28):**  types of schemes are I would say are more advanced than they are in Midwest US or Buenos  
**[0:45:40-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:45:40):**  Aires province and Argentina for example.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:45:43):**  So we haven't gotten that far yet at least at scale.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:45:46):**  There's always projects, interspersed cropping, either multi-species cropping or using permaculture  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:45:56):**  as part of the rotation, experimenting with different water management systems.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:46:01):**  That's all pretty small scale stuff at the commercial level anyway.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:46:08):**  That doesn't mean that it won't come.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:46:10):**  Again, assuming that the market continues to ask for, the food market continues to ask  
**[0:46:16-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:46:16):**  for a higher and higher value proposition and the market is willing to pay for that  
**[0:46:23-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:46:23):**  value proposition or at least support, incentivize conversions or extensions then they'll take  
**[0:46:33-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:46:33):**  hold as they take hold.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:46:34):**  Then the challenge in agriculture, the good news, bad news is the inertia that's built  
**[0:46:39-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:46:39):**  into the one-year cycle means that sometimes you have to go through an entire generation  
**[0:46:45-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:46:45):**  to see real change and it just simply takes time.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:46:55):**  And with your history of carbon sequestration, etc., do you measure that level of detail  
**[0:47:02-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:47:02):**  also with the farms you work with now?  
**[0:47:03-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:47:03):**  I mean, do you do the soil carbon tests, etc. to see, I mean, I don't know if there's a  
**[0:47:08-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:47:08):**  market now in the US for those kind of ecosystem services, but is that a level of measurement  
**[0:47:14-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:47:14):**  and transparency you also want to provide to your customers that end up buying the products?  
**[0:47:21-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:47:21):**  Just in the last 24 months, just prior to us getting started as a company and continuing  
**[0:47:29-0:47:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:47:29):**  on now with a little bit more velocity, the whole soil health discussion has really, particularly  
**[0:47:36-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:47:36):**  in the US, I mean, I'm impressed with how much that term is used because it really wasn't  
**[0:47:42-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:47:42):**  being used outside of sort of the NGO activist world until just a couple of years ago.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:47:50):**  So soil health, and that means a lot of different things, one of which is certainly organic  
**[0:47:55-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:47:55):**  matter, which is often expressed as carbon, microbial activity is another marker.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:48:05):**  There are a number of chemical analysis that can be done.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:48:10):**  And so with soil health being really the topic that's driving that conversation now getting  
**[0:48:17-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:48:17):**  commercialized by major food companies and major participants in the value chain, out  
**[0:48:24-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:48:24):**  of that conversation now the drive for measurements has started to take hold.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:48:33):**  So before it was really about soil health as a promoter of crop yield.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:48:42):**  So the tests that were being done was to see primarily how's my organic matter moving from  
**[0:48:48-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:48:48):**  year to year.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:48:49):**  There was a number of micronutrient tests and a number of, in some cases around carbon,  
**[0:48:55-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:48:55):**  but not so much.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:48:57):**  But now that it's moved more, the soil health concept has moved more mainstream, the measurements  
**[0:49:05-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:49:05):**  associated with what soil health, how do you measure soil health is becoming more of a  
**[0:49:12-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:49:12):**  commercial aspect of the business.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:49:15):**  We still do not have, as far as I know, we still do not have a major food company that  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:49:20):**  has any sort of specifications that they've come out with.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:49:25):**  But the indications are that we're moving in a direction in which, again, somewhat on  
**[0:49:32-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:49:32):**  a consumer-driven basis, that soil health, which includes the carbon component, is going  
**[0:49:40-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:49:40):**  to be something that is, those attributes are going to be more sought after in conjunction  
**[0:49:47-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:49:47):**  with the physical supply chain than they have been in the past.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:49:50):**  Doing those tests is not, you're not breaking any new ground by doing those tests.  
**[0:49:57-0:49:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:49:57):**  Those tests, we know how to do those tests.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:49:59):**  It costs money.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:50:00):**  The question is what is the motivation for doing those tests?  
**[0:50:05-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:50:05):**  And up until now, it's been mostly around understanding how the practices are affecting  
**[0:50:12-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:50:12):**  yields.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:50:14):**  But now increasingly it's becoming how are the practices affecting these other environmental  
**[0:50:19-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:50:19):**  outcomes.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:50:20):**  So if we would have this conversation again in a year from now, chances are there would  
**[0:50:25-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:50:25):**  be at least a few major companies that have made some statements around soil and hopefully  
**[0:50:32-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:50:32):**  actually also translated those statements into concrete questions and asks from their  
**[0:50:38-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:50:38):**  suppliers.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:50:39):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:50:40):**  Year over year over year, this will become more, I hesitate to use the term mandate,  
**[0:50:47-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:50:47):**  but conceptually more of a mandate in the supply chain.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:50:52):**  So this is where we start talking about, okay, which technologies are we going to use?  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:50:56):**  How important is blockchain in this whole world?  
**[0:51:01-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:01):**  But before you go into the technology of how you're going to-  
**[0:51:06-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:06):**  Somebody needs to ask it, yeah.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:07):**  Somebody needs to ask it, right?  
**[0:51:08-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:08):**  You have to have a, what I learned in my software days is you better be able to put it on paper  
**[0:51:13-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:13):**  before you start coding it, right?  
**[0:51:15-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:15):**  So we're still in that putting it on paper phase in this market.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:22):**  This will not, ultimately this will not be a technology problem.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:26):**  Technologies exist already to do a good job of capturing and expressing the data, but  
**[0:51:32-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:32):**  what is the motivation?  
**[0:51:33-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:33):**  And the craft question always comes up, who's going to pay for it?  
**[0:51:39-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:39):**  Yeah, no, it's an interesting question.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:40):**  I have discussions here with farmers in Europe and some forward thinking companies are starting  
**[0:51:50-0:51:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:50):**  to ask those questions.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:51):**  Like we've seen carbon sequestration, what does it cost per ton to put it down in an  
**[0:51:56-0:51:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:56):**  old gas field?  
**[0:51:58-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:51:58):**  And they start to slowly ask some forward thinking farmers, what would it cost to store  
**[0:52:02-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:02):**  it in your soil?  
**[0:52:05-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:05):**  And the same discussion is starting to happen around water, because it's a huge issue in  
**[0:52:09-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:09):**  the Netherlands, the amount of rain, and especially the intensity, and there's simply not enough  
**[0:52:14-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:14):**  space or not enough money to make the rivers a bit wider.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:19):**  And also the public authorities that are taking care of that system, which obviously is hugely  
**[0:52:25-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:25):**  important because otherwise it would be underwater, are starting to pay attention.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:30):**  Maybe we can use the water storage capacity of healthy soils and what would that look  
**[0:52:36-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:36):**  like?  
**[0:52:38-0:52:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:38):**  Very very early on discussions, about a year from now, there will probably be some pilot  
**[0:52:41-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:41):**  somewhere and somebody starts to figure out some of those things.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:44):**  So both water quantity management in excess and in drought.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:49):**  Yeah, drought is not so much.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:51):**  In summer it is actually.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:54):**  Both of them, plus quality which you mentioned before obviously, are all three around water  
**[0:52:59-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:52:59):**  and then your biodiversity is another one which tends to touch upon consumers a bit  
**[0:53:04-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:53:04):**  more.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:53:05):**  But yeah, water on all sides is a huge opportunity and a huge risk.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:53:12):**  Correct.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:53:13):**  In the US, one of the things that has become apparent, more apparent now to the rural communities  
**[0:53:21-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:53:21):**  is that they're groundwater.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:53:23):**  So in addition, take away the surface water discussion and go to groundwater.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:53:29):**  Many of the rural community wells that would be supplying a small town are impaired in  
**[0:53:37-0:53:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:53:37):**  terms of water quality.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:53:39):**  There's no secret about what the source of that impairment is, it's clearly agricultural  
**[0:53:44-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:53:44):**  leaching and it doesn't matter until it matters.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:53:49):**  And all of a sudden, we have towns even here in Minnesota where their community source  
**[0:53:57-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:53:57):**  of water is undrinkable from a safety standpoint.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:54:01):**  And this is not due to diseases and pathogens, this is simply due to chemical pollution.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:54:08):**  So once that starts to actually impact you and you have relatives in town even though  
**[0:54:15-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:54:15):**  you may still be out on the farm, you realize that some of what you've been told about these  
**[0:54:24-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:54:24):**  systems being benign and not being risky for the environment may not be quite so true.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:54:30):**  So there's a whole other level of conversation that I think will be the ultimate accelerator  
**[0:54:38-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:54:38):**  of conversion.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:54:39):**  Now if I could snap my fingers and turn the entire world organic overnight, I do not believe  
**[0:54:47-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:54:47):**  at this point, I wouldn't have said this a few years ago, but I do not believe at this  
**[0:54:51-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:54:51):**  point that you would see any decrease in production.  
**[0:54:54-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:54:54):**  And in fact, I would argue that over the long term, this is the only way that things can  
**[0:54:59-0:55:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:54:59):**  work over the long term.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:55:02):**  But you'd see an immediate impact in terms of environmental outcomes and I think people  
**[0:55:06-0:55:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:55:06):**  would be astounded and understand that they've been fed a bunch of stories that aren't necessarily  
**[0:55:11-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:55:11):**  true about the need for using synthetic production methods to be able to feed the world.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:55:19):**  This whole feed the world concept is a red herring.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:55:21):**  It's driving me nuts.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:55:25):**  And I think the healthcare aspect on the water, the general ecosystem around us, plus the  
**[0:55:32-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:55:32):**  nutrients in your food, the more comes out of that and the more I see some research early  
**[0:55:37-0:55:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:55:37):**  on from healthy soil to healthy produce, healthy gut systems and thus healthy people.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:55:43):**  There's a very clear link there, which we always knew, but slowly comes back and we  
**[0:55:47-0:55:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:55:47):**  have some scientific research to prove it, which is a huge, I mean that drives many of  
**[0:55:53-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:55:53):**  of course you have to do organic in a proper way.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:55:56):**  And we are going to see some examples of it not done in a proper way as a sort of a pushback  
**[0:56:01-0:56:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:56:01):**  from the industry to like, look, look, you can never feed the world because he lost 20%  
**[0:56:05-0:56:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:56:05):**  of his yield.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:56:06):**  But there are always exceptions like that.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:56:08):**  I think that healthcare and the ecosystem part in general, as we now slowly see, I mean,  
**[0:56:13-0:56:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:56:13):**  there's a paper out from Montana on the fallow, the summer fallow practice and what actually  
**[0:56:20-0:56:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:56:20):**  impact, if you only do cover crops, what's the impact on the local climate?  
**[0:56:24-0:56:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:56:24):**  And I should see a drop in temperature in the summer and more moisture in the air, which  
**[0:56:29-0:56:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:56:29):**  are two of the main dangers of climate change to high temperatures and not enough moisture  
**[0:56:35-0:56:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:56:35):**  and thus drought.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:56:36):**  So you start to hopefully see also like if I actually change enough farms to organic  
**[0:56:41-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:56:41):**  and beyond organic, we could somehow stabilize or reverse some of the huge challenges that  
**[0:56:48-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:56:48):**  this climate craziness brings with it.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:56:51):**  Well, and that's one of the reasons why we're interested primarily in row crops, because  
**[0:56:54-0:57:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:56:54):**  it's only through the broad acre system that you're going to, you know, and this is another  
**[0:57:01-0:57:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:57:01):**  interesting point of tension is because you've got what I'll call the legacy organic crowd  
**[0:57:09-0:57:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:57:09):**  who are typically farming smaller acreage and very intensive, you know, maybe 40 different  
**[0:57:19-0:57:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:57:19):**  crops on an acre, right?  
**[0:57:21-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:57:21):**  But it's mostly designed for local use and fruits and vegetables.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:57:27):**  And that's great.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:57:28):**  And not grain.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:57:29):**  But it's great.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:57:30):**  I mean, that's the food I want to eat.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:57:32):**  And I'm glad that those programs are up and going.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:57:36):**  But that is not going to make a systemic change on a local, regional or certainly global level.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:57:45):**  You have to get the broad acre involved.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:57:48):**  So you know, to us, the only way we get paid ultimately is through our handling and processing  
**[0:57:54-0:57:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:57:54):**  and transportation of broad acre crops.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:57:58):**  But it's also the only way that we think that that you can actually put a dent in the current  
**[0:58:03-0:58:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:58:03):**  trajectory is through broad acre schemes.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:58:06):**  So it's not the sexy side of agriculture, but it's we think the most important in terms  
**[0:58:11-0:58:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:58:11):**  of making these transformations.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:58:15):**  We'll make it sexy.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:58:16):**  I will keep repeating it.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:58:18):**  And just in terms of pipeline foods, whatever you want to share, obviously, but what size  
**[0:58:24-0:58:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:58:24):**  I mean, you're 50 plus people.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:58:27):**  Just to give an imagination, how many hectares are you working with or how many tons or if  
**[0:58:32-0:58:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:58:32):**  you want, how much money have you raised just to give a bit of an understanding what kind  
**[0:58:36-0:58:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:58:36):**  of size you're dealing with?  
**[0:58:38-0:58:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:58:38):**  Yeah, so I mean, so these some of these figures are estimates.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:58:44):**  But in our most recent review of the acreage that we are currently working with, North  
**[0:58:54-0:59:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:58:54):**  America, I believe it's 1.4, give or take 1.4 million acres.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:59:03):**  In Argentina, it's about 150,000 acres.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:59:09):**  Best of world through our European partnership, which we take credit for each other because  
**[0:59:14-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:59:14):**  that's the way that we've structured our deal.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:59:18):**  That's a much harder number to get our head around.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:59:24):**  We know that, for example, we've got a Sesame project in Uganda that is 60,000, give or  
**[0:59:31-0:59:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:59:31):**  take small holders.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:59:33):**  Each one of those small holders has give or take a half a hectare.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:59:39):**  That's just a single project.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:59:40):**  But measuring these things are tough, I would say.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:59:45):**  No, no, obviously, but just to have a grasp of more or less the size and not asking the  
**[0:59:51-0:59:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:59:51):**  half a hectare or acre dimension.  
**[0:59:55-1:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:59:55):**  In terms of sales for our fiscal year 19, which starts on the 1st of July coming up,  
**[1:00:05-1:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:00:05):**  we are anticipating sales of product in the range of $150 million to $175 million.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:00:16):**  I cannot share with you precisely how much money has been invested in the organization,  
**[1:00:21-1:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:00:21):**  but there's a lot more to go.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:00:26):**  When you start with private equity, you understand that there's a clock ticking.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:00:31):**  The group that we chose, I think we did a very nice job of determining who to work with.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:00:38):**  Because when you take on investors, now you've taken on more than just money.  
**[1:00:42-1:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:00:42):**  You've taken on a relationship.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:00:45):**  There were many investors that were interested in writing checks for our thesis at the beginning,  
**[1:00:50-1:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:00:50):**  but I realized that the upward management that I would have to deal with to work with  
**[1:00:59-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:00:59):**  these folks.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:01:00):**  It's key, yeah.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:01:01):**  It's key to time consuming.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:01:03):**  But even our group, they're in the business of growing businesses and then moving on.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:01:11):**  Yeah, because I was going to ask your timeframe as you are in agriculture and regenerative  
**[1:01:16-1:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:01:16):**  and sustainable agriculture takes time.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:01:18):**  Is this a 10 year?  
**[1:01:21-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:01:21):**  What kind of long term mission focused?  
**[1:01:25-1:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:01:25):**  How do you lock into that if you take on even a patient private equity party?  
**[1:01:30-1:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:01:30):**  Yeah, so we're already now discussing, we've got some very specific investments that are  
**[1:01:37-1:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:01:37):**  appealing to very specific pools of capital with a mission orientation, an impact orientation.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:01:44):**  I would guess that within the next 12 months, we will already start accepting limited investments  
**[1:01:51-1:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:01:51):**  from those groups.  
**[1:01:52-1:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:01:52):**  Already starting to build a path towards what I'd call the next-  
**[1:01:56-1:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:01:56):**  I mean like specific vehicles, et cetera, to put money to work.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:02:00):**  So, there's already this sense of, look at ultimately the ownership of this business  
**[1:02:09-1:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:02:09):**  from a financial standpoint should be in the hands of those who have an evergreen view  
**[1:02:16-1:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:02:16):**  and want to perpetuate and are interested in the very long term.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:02:22):**  But many of those are risk adverse.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:02:24):**  I mean as you know in the impact space, the challenge of the quality of the investment  
**[1:02:30-1:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:02:30):**  opportunity or the maturity of the investment opportunity are two of the key issues in the  
**[1:02:38-1:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:02:38):**  impact space.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:02:39):**  And it's no different in agriculture than it is in other components.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:02:44):**  But now that we have a little bit of time under our belt and we can demonstrate that  
**[1:02:48-1:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:02:48):**  we are making progress towards some of the milestones that we set out and initially advertised,  
**[1:02:55-1:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:02:55):**  some of the initial conversations we had with impact investors weren't necessarily as financially  
**[1:03:02-1:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:03:02):**  sophisticated but are much more sophisticated in other means and therefore need a little  
**[1:03:09-1:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:03:09):**  bit more maturity of the platform into which they're investing.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:03:13):**  We are now reconvening with those folks and I do expect within the next 12 months that  
**[1:03:20-1:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:03:20):**  we will have additional investment into this organization from impact investment institutions  
**[1:03:28-1:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:03:28):**  whether it's again family office or in some cases we're talking to some foundations.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:03:34):**  With a specific long term view and then might at some point the private equity group needs  
**[1:03:39-1:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:03:39):**  to move on and that's then possible.  
**[1:03:41-1:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:03:41):**  And I see that a lot.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:03:42):**  I mean you really need to stage it and find the right capital for the right moment but  
**[1:03:46-1:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:03:46):**  then how do you structure it in a way that the mission is locked in but you can still  
**[1:03:51-1:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:03:51):**  raise capital.  
**[1:03:52-1:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:03:52):**  I mean those are a few juggling balls to play with.  
**[1:03:55-1:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:03:55):**  Just to finalize because I want to be conscious of your time as well.  
**[1:03:58-1:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:03:58):**  If you would be, I mean imagine there's a room full of very smart impact investors listening  
**[1:04:04-1:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:04):**  to this podcast who are ready to move into soil.  
**[1:04:07-1:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:07):**  They've read the books.  
**[1:04:08-1:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:08):**  They've been to Rodeo.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:10):**  They're ready.  
**[1:04:11-1:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:11):**  What would be your, without giving investment advice, what would be your path?  
**[1:04:16-1:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:16):**  Your advice to look out for and to orientate and basically to get started?  
**[1:04:23-1:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:23):**  That's a tough one to come up with a spot answer.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:29):**  So I obviously have a bias.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:33):**  I think that one of the things that sounds like I'm pitching pipeline but one of the  
**[1:04:40-1:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:40):**  things I think is that...  
**[1:04:42-1:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:42):**  You went through that process and started pipeline.  
**[1:04:44-1:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:44):**  So there's a very, I mean that's what you obviously thought after you could have retired.  
**[1:04:50-1:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:50):**  It's very hard for any investment community to participate in agriculture in the space  
**[1:04:56-1:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:56):**  in which we're in.  
**[1:04:57-1:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:04:57):**  I don't mean even the sustainability space.  
**[1:05:00-1:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:05:00):**  I'm talking about the midstream asset based commodity space because most of the large  
**[1:05:06-1:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:05:06):**  scale projects, if your mandate is that you can't do it, you can't write a check for under  
**[1:05:13-1:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:05:13):**  $20 million let's say just as a number.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:05:18):**  It's very, very hard for you to find something to invest in assets in agriculture.  
**[1:05:25-1:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:05:25):**  You can buy businesses.  
**[1:05:27-1:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:05:27):**  You can certainly buy land.  
**[1:05:31-1:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:05:31):**  But the midstream piece is very tough to get access to because there's a whole bunch of  
**[1:05:35-1:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:05:35):**  really, really tiny projects that would be too small and then all the big stuff is owned  
**[1:05:41-1:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:05:41):**  by the big guys and they don't need your money.  
**[1:05:44-1:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:05:44):**  So Cargill is not looking for impact investors or any investors frankly to come along.  
**[1:05:50-1:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:05:50):**  They have a bank.  
**[1:05:52-1:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:05:52):**  So we represent, and I had to learn this during the fundraising process, I learned how to  
**[1:05:58-1:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:05:58):**  present ourselves as an aggregating platform of a bunch of relatively small individual  
**[1:06:04-1:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:06:04):**  components that in total represent the opportunity to take a relatively large check and put it  
**[1:06:10-1:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:06:10):**  to work and we deal with all the paper cuts associated with the smallness of the individual  
**[1:06:15-1:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:06:15):**  pieces.  
**[1:06:18-1:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:06:18):**  So in the impact space where a lot of things are still being tried and may not be proven  
**[1:06:26-1:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:06:26):**  to be commercially successful, what you're looking for clearly, this is true everywhere  
**[1:06:33-1:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:06:33):**  is you're looking for a strong management team, but the ability to pivot during the  
**[1:06:40-1:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:06:40):**  inevitable curves in the road, particularly in the early years of an organization, is  
**[1:06:47-1:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:06:47):**  critical in the impact investment space and even more so the diversity of the management  
**[1:06:51-1:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:06:51):**  team in terms of their backgrounds so that they can think about things in a more holistic  
**[1:06:58-1:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:06:58):**  sense is critical.  
**[1:07:00-1:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:07:00):**  We have people from the airline industry.  
**[1:07:01-1:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:07:01):**  We have people from the processing industry.  
**[1:07:03-1:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:07:03):**  We have people from traditional agriculture.  
**[1:07:05-1:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:07:05):**  We have people from the financial industry.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:07:08):**  We've got this wonderful melange of skill sets so our conversations can really span  
**[1:07:16-1:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:07:16):**  pretty much across the spectrum of what you might not usually think about in business  
**[1:07:21-1:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:07:21):**  but can be much more important when you're dealing with trying to create a new paradigm.  
**[1:07:27-1:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:07:27):**  And I know that that sounds all very wonderful, quite ambiguous.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:07:33):**  That's why I don't give investment advice.  
**[1:07:37-1:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:07:37):**  But I think at the end of the day, the quality of the management team and their experience  
**[1:07:43-1:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:07:43):**  in some aspect of execution prior to whatever it is you're considering investing in is critical.  
**[1:07:51-1:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:07:51):**  I think it's an excellent point to look at.  
**[1:07:55-1:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:07:55):**  From our conversation before, looking at scale, what do you want to achieve?  
**[1:08:00-1:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:08:00):**  Impact is great, but if you're looking at small scale organic farms of a few acres but  
**[1:08:06-1:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:08:06):**  you want to actually change local climate, you need to look at many, many, many.  
**[1:08:12-1:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:08:12):**  And then looking at an experienced management team to actually change, to get a new paradigm.  
**[1:08:19-1:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:08:19):**  And probably, I mean, I would add long term view because this is a generation and generations  
**[1:08:24-1:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:08:24):**  work.  
**[1:08:25-1:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:08:25):**  So unless you're in it for the long run, probably agriculture in general is not a good idea.  
**[1:08:30-1:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:08:30):**  I would absolutely agree with that.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:08:32):**  One of the things, I mean, again, selfishly, what we would love to see is we would love  
**[1:08:36-1:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:08:36):**  to see a pool of capital that has somehow been formed that is expressly intended to  
**[1:08:44-1:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:08:44):**  be used to help the conversion process.  
**[1:08:50-1:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:08:50):**  And I would suggest that it can be an evergreen pool that regenerates itself.  
**[1:08:54-1:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:08:54):**  So another form of regenerative, so it's not a one time capital.  
**[1:08:58-1:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:08:58):**  And the way that it regenerates itself is it participates in those out years in terms  
**[1:09:02-1:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:02):**  of the profitability.  
**[1:09:05-1:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:05):**  I toyed with a concept that's essentially a green bond concept until I realized that  
**[1:09:15-1:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:15):**  to put money together in a green bond at scale, then I have to put the money to work right  
**[1:09:18-1:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:18):**  away and we're not quite there yet.  
**[1:09:22-1:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:22):**  They are coming.  
**[1:09:23-1:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:23):**  They're coming.  
**[1:09:24-1:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:24):**  I'm talking to some people.  
**[1:09:26-1:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:26):**  I hope to have an interview up for a climate bond actually in India that's taking, I have  
**[1:09:31-1:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:31):**  to say the numbers right, I think about 8 million smallholder farmers to beyond organic  
**[1:09:35-1:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:35):**  as they call it, natural budget farming.  
**[1:09:39-1:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:39):**  And there's a region that takes on that challenge and they are probably going to raise 2.3 billion  
**[1:09:45-1:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:45):**  through BNP Peribas for that climate bond.  
**[1:09:48-1:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:48):**  Of course, it's a state government doing it, etc, etc.  
**[1:09:51-1:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:51):**  But it shows that we're moving in a direction where serious capital, hopefully if that one  
**[1:09:57-1:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:57):**  is successful, still takes probably a year.  
**[1:09:59-1:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:09:59):**  But we're moving into the direction of serious capital, which is quite exciting.  
**[1:10:03-1:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:10:03):**  Yeah, no, I fully agree.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:10:05):**  And I'm envious that that can be put together in a place like India.  
**[1:10:11-1:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:10:11):**  And yet we seem to struggle to put that together, to put even a small scale version of that  
**[1:10:15-1:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:10:15):**  together in some place like the USA.  
**[1:10:20-1:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:10:20):**  Investment in soil health, you can create a whole wheel of fortune, if you will, with  
**[1:10:28-1:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:10:28):**  lots of slivers of benefits all coming from essentially the same thing.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:10:35):**  And so if you can pool capital and that capital can be put to work to help sponsor the initiation,  
**[1:10:44-1:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:10:44):**  because our biggest problem in the US is we do not have enough acres that are organic  
**[1:10:48-1:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:10:48):**  to support our domestic demands.  
**[1:10:50-1:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:10:50):**  So we're importing, now granted, we're always going to import things we can't grow here,  
**[1:10:54-1:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:10:54):**  but we import 75% of our organic corn and soybeans.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:10:59):**  And let alone whether those imports are truly organic or not.  
**[1:11:05-1:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:05):**  That's a whole different discussion.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:08):**  But the point is we are the king of soybeans and corn, and yet we're importing organic  
**[1:11:11-1:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:11):**  soybeans and organic corn because we don't grow enough here.  
**[1:11:15-1:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:15):**  So one of the ways to accelerate that conversion is to have sympathetic capital available that's  
**[1:11:23-1:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:23):**  not looking to make a one-time investment for a one-time return, but is looking to perpetually  
**[1:11:27-1:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:27):**  spin that wheel.  
**[1:11:28-1:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:28):**  Transition finance.  
**[1:11:29-1:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:29):**  Transition financing.  
**[1:11:31-1:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:31):**  And so we've had several people, and they're still investigating this, putting together  
**[1:11:36-1:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:36):**  essentially a soil health bond or organic conversion bond.  
**[1:11:41-1:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:41):**  So at some level the name may or may not be important, but the whole concept is.  
**[1:11:47-1:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:47):**  No, the name is important because it signals a lot of things.  
**[1:11:51-1:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:51):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:52-1:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:52):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:53-1:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:11:53):**  So I'll hold up my hand and say we'd be more than willing to work with investors who are  
**[1:12:00-1:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:12:00):**  interested in that.  
**[1:12:01-1:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:12:01):**  And our job in that would be to get the acres up and going.  
**[1:12:06-1:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:12:06):**  Our job in that would be to commercialize the product.

**[1:15:49-1:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:15:49):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:15:51-1:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:15:51):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture

**[1:16:08-1:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:16:08):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what

**[1:16:21-1:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:16:21):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:16:22-1:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:16:22):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:16:24-1:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:16:24):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.

**[1:16:30-1:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=1:16:30):**  It's also not investment advice.

### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2020-00-12)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  So welcome to the third Patreon and supporter exclusive Q&A webinar, this time on a more  Asia Australia and also actually Europe friendlier time zone.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:00:28):**  I'm very happy to have Geert van de Weer, founder of Herrenbuhl in here.  We know each other, I always look back, I think three or four, maybe five years.  And I still remember the first time you shared the concept of Herrenbuhl.  You come from a lot of experience in the farming sector.  And I remember spending, I think two hours, we had a tea or coffee somewhere trying to  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:00:49):**  shoot holes in the concept and I couldn't find one except for the investor side of things.  So that's definitely something we're going to talk about.  And that was actually also your question, like how do you invest in something like this  or how do you put money to work?  And that's something we have been looking at actually a number of times.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:01:05):**  We organized a dinner in the Netherlands with a number of investors.  We have done obviously two interviews and we're very happy to have you at this Q&A because  I always felt the two interviews we did are very nice, but they only scratch the surface.  I think they're both more or less half an hour and they only scratch the surface of  the immense world that there is behind Herrenbuhl.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:01:25):**  And so I wanted to take this opportunity to have you here and be able to ask you a few  more questions and obviously also get the audience to ask a few more.  Thank you for having us.  So to kick off, what does a moment of crisis, I hear a lot of stories of people working  local food systems that are seeing an enormous increase or an enormous stress if they're  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:01:50):**  mostly focusing on restaurants and places where people eat out.  What do you see in terms of Herrenbuhl and when people suddenly realize maybe after the  toilet paper, where's the food, where's my food coming from?  I see empty shelves in my supermarket.  Is that something you see in the last few weeks?  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:02:09):**  Yeah, we do really have a lot of people.  Good morning.  Hey, Emi.  Good morning.  Good morning.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:02:18):**  I just asked the question, what does it mean for something like Herrenbuhl in a time of  these severe crises in terms of food interest, et cetera?  Sorry, Criat, go ahead.  Well, there is a two-side answer.  And the one side is that there are a lot of people thinking about where the food is coming  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:02:38):**  from, how systems nowadays work.  And they realize that international big world markets for food is not only, it's just actually  something for pure economic goals to reach.  And they start thinking like, OK, well, what can I do and how can I change my own behavior  towards the food system?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:03:03):**  And what we really notice right now is that a lot of people are taking, try to get in  contact with us.  So how can we have our own farm nearby?  Because that's the mainstream we nowadays feel that is happening outside.  But the other way around is that there is a big social aspect in our farm concept.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:03:28):**  So people are used to gather and come together on the farms to do some help or organize other  activities.  And that's only in the, in one way, it's kind of entertainment.  So you could have skipped that part.  But it's also necessary to come together to take decisions because our members are the  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:03:53):**  ones taking decisions on the farm.  So that's something that is really, well, for a lot of people not used to using Zoom  or Skype.  It's a new world.  And we really have to try to train them in this.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:04:10):**  So this is the new standard at this moment.  That's the only thing we can do.  So like tonight, there is this big Zoom meeting with all the board members of the farms.  We have now seven farms up and running the 32 projects here in the Netherlands.  So we have a lot of people together tonight and we're discussing this topic.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:04:31):**  How to continue the production on the farms so that might not stop.  And how to take, how to keep the movement going because people are inside, you know,  and we are used to get outside and to meet each other and to really also to really feel  each other.  You know, you can gather through Zoom, of course, but physical meetings are more, yeah,  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:04:57):**  there is more layers in that meeting than just seeing each other.  So in one side, we are getting more and more busier and the other side, we are busier with  the stuff.  How can we keep this going?  But yes, people are really, really thinking here on, okay, what are we doing?  
**[0:05:17-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:05:17):**  I think, especially in my region where big world markets for, especially for pigs production  is really big and we have also some, yeah, a lot of negative consequences in this region  from that like, like smell stinks, it stinks here.  There are a lot of farmers with big farms, over 10,000 pigs in one square, one hexar,  for example, that's a lot of pigs.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:05:52):**  We have a lot of farms like that.  So in this region, people are really overthinking the consequence of what we have built in the  last decades.  Yes, we are in a way benefiting, but it's real hard when people are sitting in a home.  Yeah, I can imagine.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:06:08):**  And do you see that a lot of the local initiatives, the different here in Wuhan are getting more  interest, like the website visit is up, are people Googling for food or is that like,  do they get more inbound?  Obviously people cannot visit too much and too easy, but I think the production and the  pickup just continues as scheduled because that's quite an essential, I don't think it's  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:06:30):**  something they would close.  Yes, it is.  But yes, we see, of course, it happens when we see the increase in visitor on the website,  we see the increase in telephone calls we get or social media friends, et cetera.  So yes, we see a little increase, but it's hard when you are not before Corona crisis,  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:06:56):**  when you were involved with one of the projects, you know each other, you know, you can more  easily connect through Zoom or something, but to step in a project which is starting  right now because you want it right now, because right now you have this feeling of, okay,  I can do something myself, I got to start my farm.  It's hard to connect, you know, most of the projects we have, like I said, 32 right now,  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:07:25):**  they all start with a gathering, you know, a meeting somewhere in a public space where  people come together and we tell them the first steps and the why, et cetera.  And it's hard to organize something when you have to, you cannot have a big invitation  somewhere in the city or the local store.  It's hard to, but we are collecting all these people, maybe you should have, maybe you've  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:07:53):**  seen the dots on the map, we are plotting them right now, so people are leaving behind  not too much information because that's not, we're not able to collect them through legislation,  but they can at least see how many people show their interest.  Yeah, exactly.  And I think we have been measuring and counting, I think half of the people who are involved  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:08:16):**  right now is also with a dot on the map.  So it's people involved is more than double than you can see.  Just I'm realizing that I always jump straight in, but just to do one or two sentences, I  think most people have either listened to the interviews we did or had a look at farmingcommunities.org,  but just two sentences on here for anybody that it's too early or too late to think,  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:08:40):**  I heard about this, but which Q&A webinar am I on?  Which Zoom line am I on?  Can you very briefly intro it and then we dive deeper because already Emi had sent a  number of good deep questions to dive into.  Well the concept at the end is quite simple.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:08:58):**  We gather around 20 hectares, about 200 households representing 500 people and they become the  member of cooperative and we have 200 members and every member pays an entrance fee around  about 2000 euros once.  So together with 200 households we collect 400,000 euros and with this 400,000 we do  all the investment necessary to start the farm.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:09:31):**  So we buy the tractor, etc, etc.  And we hire the land and the cooperative has the farmer as an employee.  So the farmer is not the entrepreneur anymore.  People all together, you know, the big gathering of all the members, they are really the entrepreneur.  And what we do, we produce as much as possible to what they need.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:09:59):**  So I've never seen one man living just from one product.  We don't only eat potatoes.  So when you produce towards the needs of the members, you have a very various farm.  Like we are producing fruit, apples, pear, prunes.  We're producing 50 different kinds of vegetables.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:10:22):**  We have pigs for the meat.  We have chickens for eggs and meat.  We have cows for meat.  Not dairy yet, but that has something to do with regulation, but we could also have dairy  products.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:10:35):**  We also produce our own feather.  So we're trying to be as circular as possible.  And in the end there are three pillars underneath this concept.  We are producing with nature, so not against nature.  We could have another deep dive into that, but that's what we do.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:10:54):**  So it's called nature-driven production.  So nature tells us what to do, nature-driven.  We are socially bonded.  So that is something like we...  Actually the goal is to bring people together and to connect them with the soil again.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:11:12):**  And the other pillar is what we call economically embedded.  Like it's the economic part that enables us to run the farm instead of economy and gaining  money is a goal of itself.  Production and services, extra value for creation is that what's really the goal of the farm.  So these three pillars are beneath that.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:11:38):**  And when we deep dive into that, yeah, we can have another conversation.  I think we will with looking at a few of the people on the call.  But what I like, I mean, it sounds...  The first time I heard it, obviously, it sounds like some other concepts, CSAs, I would say  sometimes even a bit cute and funny.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:11:57):**  But then you've really built a machine or an organism to create many, many, many.  Of course you started with one and two, but it even tricked me into writing exponential  growth and regenerative agriculture in the same sentence as it is really scaling up.  We are 32 now in the pipeline of very, very concrete farms.  And if you look at that line, and we're all now statisticians and looking at models all  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:12:20):**  day, but for another reason, if you continue that growth, it becomes quite an interesting  footprint in the Netherlands and Europe.  And it becomes quite a few people that get up to 60% of their daily calorie needs and  nutrient needs from a very local farm.  Obviously, they're olive oil and they're oranges not, but a lot of other things come from a  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:12:41):**  farm, maybe a kilometer or two kilometers away.  And it's economically viable that you can actually pay a farmer to a very good salary,  which is something that most farmers, I would argue, to find a farmer that has a good salary  or has a good, easy, relatively easy income.  Obviously, it's not easy.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:12:56):**  You have 200 or you have 500 people that are trying to tell you also partly what to do.  But it's a very interesting model, obviously, from that sense in terms of the potential  of scale.  I keep coming back to a Heerbrunn as a very interesting model, but just not to keep the  questions away from the audience.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:13:15):**  I know Emi has one, has a few actually, but I would love to start with the first one.  You want to ask it yourself, Emi, on the multiple generation one, I think is very interesting  because you mentioned you're renting the land.  Yeah, exactly.  Yes.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:13:27):**  So in short, my name is Emi Hunkleif.  I work for Master Seed Trust and I'm actually also a Heerbrunn.  So it makes it very interesting.  I'm a Heerbrunn in Oberlis, near Breda.  Oh, okay.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:13:41):**  Nice.  Yeah.  And it's also, as you said, we have 125 members right now and we're trying to scale to 200  members to have the full membership cohort.  And these are interesting times because I can imagine anything happening within economic  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:13:56):**  recession might influence that as well.  But that aside.  Yeah, it was interesting.  I had to hear about, because obviously I know the concept well and I also through Coop's  podcast heard about other CSA initiatives, like for example, Büchterland in Germany.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:14:17):**  It's a bit of a different model, but there they kind of modeled the land ownership in  such a way that they perceive it as stewardship.  So there is this kind of separate cooperative that is investing together with the farmers  in a shared cooperative model.  And for each farm, they have then set up a different company and that company is then  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:14:42):**  a steward of the lands.  And then that allows the farm to be leader for generations.  So my idea, my question was like, what are your thoughts on kind of this multiple generation  lands ownership?  Like I know in the Hebrew concept initially it was this idea, but I see like in practice,  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:15:03):**  for example, on our lands, we hire it for six years on the government.  What are your ideas about this?  And quite sure you're struggling with this.  Yes, we do.  Yeah.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:15:15):**  So thank you for your question.  Do you know also, here, for example?  Yeah, I know that you have a collaboration there with StittinKumbir, right?  Yeah, that's true.  So what we did there is we, that has everything to do with the soil fund.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:15:33):**  And so what we see right now, and also that's something due to regulation that it's not  very interesting for the landowners to do something more than six years, 12 years.  That's the utmost.  Or give it away in, how do you call it?  So you get that.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:15:59):**  So for 26 years, that's what, and you've become almost the owner, but you cannot say you own  the land.  That's the long term something.  It's a very specific Dutch law.  Exactly.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:16:12):**  So it's hard to explain, but...  It's not easy to buy and it's not easy to rent long term, basically.  I think that's the...  Exactly.  That's the main problem.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:16:26):**  So what we see right now, what we did, we started the soil fund.  I already told something about it in one of the podcasts, but the next step is that, let  me a little bit explain about the soil fund.  What we do is we try to find investors.  Investors put their money into the soil fund.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:16:45):**  In this case, it's Kondbehe.  So they donate money or they get the mortgage or something for buying soil.  So the soil fund buys the soil and then there is going to be, depending on the construction,  whether it's give away money or it's investment money or is it not, it could be a mortgage  as well.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:17:07):**  So in this case of Land van Wijk, the farm in Wijk, we bought the land in that construction.  Next step is how do we get the land in the hand of the people?  And it's not necessarily the same group of people who are participating in the Heerboer  farm, but it's what, in my opinion, in our opinion, recombining land is one of the goals  of Heerboer.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:17:31):**  So we are now working on this pilot project, trying to give the chance to all the people  living nearby the farm of Heerboer Wirth.  And we are thinking of obligations, you know, like can we put on, can everybody buy a share  about let's say 500 or 1000 euros?  And how many people do we need together to bring back the money to the investor?  
**[0:18:02-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:18:02):**  And what we are discussing right now with the land trust right now is how much can we  have to say on the common land, all the people gathering this money, they will give it back  to the investor, you know, so they become kind of owner, but the ownership we want to  have in the soil fund itself, because that's a kind of lockdown, you know, or lockdown  in this terms, but it's locked up.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:18:34):**  That's what I need to say, you know, soil is locked up in the fund, but you want as  much, want the people have as much as say as possible.  So what we are doing right now, we are piloting this.  So we are gathering, I think it will be April when we start with this, we are trying to  gather a lot of people nearby the farm in Wirth who bring up money.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:18:56):**  We think of the less part, at least 500, you know, and they can buy, for example, five  times 500, because when you have one party buying thousands, you have no democracy anymore  in this project.  So we're trying to think of limiting the amount of investment.  So we think of shares of 500 and max five per person or per family.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:19:29):**  And this is how we try to bring back the ownership within like the ownership back to the people.  And the discussion right now is what do they have to say?  What are their rights when they do that?  It's not only gaining a little bit of interest because that's not much, but it's the questions  are can they have demands or how to use the land?  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:19:56):**  You know, can they have a say in who is going to be the farmer on the land?  And in this case, of course, it is a here to move a farm.  But when looking at the big perspective of the soil fund, you know, we are thinking of  okay, how, how are we selecting or electing the farmer who is going to work on the land?  And it's, it's almost as in a parallel with the farms, our farms, you know, they do the  
**[0:20:23-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:20:23):**  same democracy, they do decide what's going to happen.  So to me, it's a logic.  Next step in the soil fund to go and see how community or cooperatives can own the land.  But there is one aspect and I think it's typical Dutch or maybe it's more Western.  We don't want it.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:20:45):**  We don't want the soil to go back on the free market because it's too speculative.  So the all the people together could also take easily a decision, okay, let's sell the  soil and have a lot of money and spread it over the members.  And that's what we don't want to happen.  It's only I want to block and make sure I want to block that.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:21:07):**  Yeah.  So that's why why soil itself will be always in the trust.  But the rights on how to decision how to make decisions, they will be spread over the new  common.  Is that the answer to your question?  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:21:23):**  Yeah, that gives a good back up answer for like what's the next step in these pursuits.  Yeah.  Thank you.  So you see us as a foundation, Heerbu Foundation, actually we're starting a next concept.  We have the farm.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:21:38):**  People can own the farm, but the next concept is people can own the land.  I think that will be the big game changer in farming in the Netherlands.  Why do you say that?  Because what we see right now that the soil here in the Netherlands is very expensive  and the soil prices are rising every day.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:22:03):**  So soil is not as expensive as in relation to what it can bring, you know, so it's too  expensive.  And what you see right now is that not only a new coming concepts like ours are not able  to start a concept, but it's also the existing farmers who are not able to bring their farm  to the next generation.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:22:28):**  Because the amount of investment is really, really, really too high, too big.  What you're saying the production capacity of the soil, especially obviously if you're  I mean, in all types of agriculture, but the nature driven regenerative way you're farming  really looks obviously at the production capacity of the soil, the soil health, etc.  What can it bring for the next generations?  
**[0:22:52-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:22:52):**  That comes back to your question, Emi.  And not just for the next five years and how much can we squeeze out of it.  It's not connected or is no longer connected to the price on the market of a hectare or  of 100 hectares, etc.  Like those two things have been speculatively driven out, like away from each other, which  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:23:11):**  makes it very, very, very difficult for a farmer's son or daughter to take over the  city or for any new enthusiastic group of people that want to start a farm to get a  sufficient amount of hectares to just to give an understanding 20 hectares, what would it  cost normally very difficult because it depends on location.  But let's say for a few of the farms that have been started through you so far, what  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:23:35):**  would a 20 hectare project cost?  Well, I think we now pay about on average here in the whole country, I think it's seven  to eight euros per square meter.  But that's so that's 80,000 per hectare and we need 20.  So that's a big investment.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:23:55):**  But what I've seen already and I'm working in more than 20 years in this domain and I've  seen 20 years ago that we were calculating within euros.  I think we were calculating with five euros per square meter.  And what you're calculating right now, you have to double it.  But your income hadn't doubled.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:24:21):**  Actually it stayed stable or even decreased a little.  So you see that it's not it's only a half percent of return on investment or one percent  on return on investment.  So it's and in the 20 years I've been doing this work, I think it went from a two percent  to one percent to less than a percent.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:24:43):**  I think on average right now it's dot eight percent.  You mean a return of an investor of a farmer on his or her investment in and that doesn't  count obviously the crazy hours.  Yeah.  So it's very, very yet when they say razor thin margins, they probably talk about this  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:25:00):**  sector.  And when you look at it, I don't know whether we have time for that.  But in the Netherlands, the average farm has a value of three million euros and one third  of it is financed by banks or other financers like the company you buy the feather for your  animals from is also one of the parties giving the mortgages for example.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:25:29):**  So that's one third.  So one million is in loans.  So the feed company or the input companies also gives you loans, which could be up to  a third of your speaking about a locked in system.  Exactly.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:25:42):**  Exactly.  So that's what I want to illustrate.  And so that's that's a three million value for the farm.  On average, it's about three hundred thousand.  What they do on a yearly annual base and less than thirty thousand is what they have as  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:26:03):**  an income.  So it's three million, three hundred thousand, thirty thousand.  But the thirty thousand there is also on average one half fifty percent of it is coming from  the Brussels support.  So they can only make fifteen thousand themselves on an investment on three million.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:26:21):**  That's not doable, is it?  So that's that what that are the figures here in the Netherlands.  We're trying to beat that with our concept.  Just just a question.  I just did a quick calculation.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:26:35):**  If you sorry I'm Jan from.  Good morning Jan.  Good morning.  I just did a quick calculation.  If you if the hectare price is eighty thousand, the farm is one point six million.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:26:50):**  If you divide this by two hundred five hundred people, it's three thousand two hundred.  If you do that per household, it's eight thousand euros plus two thousand.  I need to pay for setting up the farm.  So it would basically be a ten thousand euro investment per family to have my food secured  for a generation, for generations basically.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:27:19):**  That I think makes this relatively seen a very attractive investment.  And have you ever thought to promote it like this and even maybe find a way to finance  it to a certain extent so that people can take a little mortgage on it or whatever?  Which I think comes to a question of accessibility.  It's very interesting.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:27:46):**  So I answer the question of Jan and then we can go on to accessibility because not everybody  has 10K.  And that's what I thought one of the other questions you sent me already Koon was also  about that.  You know it has everything to do with the accessibility to the concept.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:28:04):**  And we are already facing a situation that people tell us you are for the upper class  white, the one percent.  I think that's not completely true.  But because when you calculate and when you do what you did Jan it's true.  When I look at the market of solar panels here in the Netherlands people easily invest  
**[0:28:32-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:28:32):**  eight thousand euros to get solar energy.  So what's the difference?  And when you buy a house you have a mortgage of at least 200 maybe 300 thousand.  What is the other eight or ten thousand when you can secure your food?  That's a question.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:28:47):**  And that has everything to do with culture.  I think here in the Netherlands we are not that we think that it's not just normal that  supermarket is full of stuff and full with food.  And so it's a question of is there a real felt necessity to do this?  I think we're not there yet.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:29:11):**  We are with the corona and everything else it really helps in a way.  But we're not there yet.  And right now we are.  So we're trying to make it as easy as possible to step in.  So that's the that's and we kept on calculating and we over and over again that the figure  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:29:31):**  of the two thousand was the what we had to do.  But yes.  But I remember having discussions with you and you were saying I'm worried that people  may be not willing to pay that and we might need to find some financing even for the two  thousand which obviously doesn't include the land buying so that adds the eight thousand  
**[0:29:50-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:29:50):**  to it.  And so far I think you didn't really have issues with it like the two thousand hasn't  been a barrier but maybe now as you scale you see that more.  Is that something that changed from the beginning like two three four years ago to now?  No no no.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:30:05):**  Not at all.  So we have.  But in addition to what we exchanged at that moment there were a few experiences right  now and it's not the two thousand.  We didn't discuss it yet but on an annual base we share cost of the farm.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:30:19):**  So we calculate all the costs and we share it over five hundred people and so you do  not buy your food but you pay your contribution to the cooperative and that's the outcome  of how many costs are we going to make this year.  We are with five hundred people over fifty two weeks you are going to pay ten euros eleven  euros on average each member per week.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:30:43):**  So that's how we do it on an annual base but it's not the two thousand that is a problem.  You know it's the ten euros for the really lower class people to jump in.  And yes when we compare it to supermarket we are cheaper in organic food and around  around about the average price for food in the supermarket.  If you compare what you get from our farms to what you would have had in the supermarket.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:31:09):**  So there actually there is no no reason to do not jump into this concept but the people  who cannot afford a two thousand you can give it from it can subsidize the two thousand  of course but then the next problem comes ten euros per week is a lot of money for that  for the group of people.  And it's not ten euros per week because it's ten euros per person.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:31:32):**  Yeah of course.  But altogether it's still cheaper than organic in the supermarket.  Yes it's true.  It's ten euros per person per week what you pay for your food in the contribution to the  cooperative.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:31:48):**  Do you think it's something that changed like the discussion now of this food security piece  especially with virus but in general like what Jan was asking have you ever thought  about pushing that or marketing that or putting it like that like look you buy food security  or buy food security buy sort of food security for the long term.  Do you see people doing it because of that or it's mostly I want to be closer to my food  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:32:11):**  which is a type of food security but I want to see where it come from health but the food  security piece has it been a.  Not that much.  It's upcoming right now you know in terms of the corona time.  This is what people really say right now oh wow whatever happens in supermarket empty  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:32:28):**  shelves I don't care we have the food in the in the farm you know so it's right now it's  a kind of coming up but it's not that heavy yet but I can imagine in other countries we  are at this I've been given this assignment to one of these I gave this assignment to  one of these heroes here trying to find a country outside the Netherlands to start with  kind of here a bull concept right now which one is the best to start you know and I already  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:33:00):**  get some feedback from what they're doing and I think okay in other countries it might  be even a bigger issue than here in the Netherlands so here in the Netherlands it is how it's  produced know the people who are who did work on your food know where it comes from make  sure it's that there is no chemical chemicals use etc etc that are all arguments also in  addition it's just fun you know that's also one of one big aspect that's just nice to  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:33:32):**  go to the farm with your children and see the animals etc etc so that are the main reasons  people jump in right now and and food security is not yet an issue but I can imagine that  in other countries it might be the first argument.  Corona will be the game changer.  I think it is you know and it's it you're right it's quite easily to do this in from  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:34:01):**  the perspective from the concept is no it's no it's no difficulty you can your calculations  okay they might be right you know they're they're really close to what's what we're  calculating as well so it's not difficult to do that but it's not felt as a necessity  right now it's not the main argument to jump in the farm.  And I think Emi had a question on the inequality piece or the accessibility when you said it's  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:34:30):**  possible obviously we can subsidize the 2000 at the beginning to get in but then you have  the 10 euros per head of the family per per week and that also is connected to the cost  of the cooperative in a sense that if the cost of the cooperative go down goes down  because people are helping obviously the cost of the year after might be 9 euros or something  but there is a hard I mean there's a hard cost in running a small scale regenerative  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:34:54):**  very mixed farm and it's it's your your single apple might not be as cheap as others but  obviously the whole package and the costs are lower than what you get in the supermarket.  What's your idea how to get this to people that aren't buying organic now at the supermarket  and are looking at the cost and say yeah I would pay 6 euros for this if I would buy  the equivalent is that you get people to have that discussion on food quality food pricing  
**[0:35:22-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:35:22):**  as well like you see people coming in that you might be surprised about that they make  that decision now because they the 8 the 10 euros is quite a lot.  Well yes well there is maybe I can respond to this like this what we see is that it's  not only there is a difference between being a member and being a consumer and I think  that's the main answer to the question you know when you want to do this for the consumers  
**[0:35:52-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:35:52):**  or just used to pick what is offered and they have a lot of demands on quality and etc etc  of course we have to deliver quality as well let that be straight but there is a difference  between being a consumer with all the demands you have sometimes we deliver a lettuce with  a little bit of sandy soil in it you know you wash it at home perfectly you know no  problem but you have to do that and what if people now leave the farm with a big smile  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:36:23):**  I have my own lettuce hey wow I need to wash it at home no problem but what if this lettuce  would be in the supermarket I think supermarket manager would have a real big problem so there  is a difference between consumers and members and the members are really connected to their  project to the farm to the soil to their food and as soon as we are lowering the way people  can enter the system so let's try to find a subsidize for all the 2000s let's try to  
**[0:36:53-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:36:53):**  subsidize half of the of the weekly costs I think consumer behavior gets in and consumer  behavior creates a distance to your food because it's not you who has any responsibility you  can you can be really judgment judgmental towards the one who is creating your food  again it's not you having a responsibility as a consumer so there are it's more than  just a consumer project it's not just a choice it's a way of life it's it's taking responsibility  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:37:27):**  is I really want it to be connected to what you're eating and it's not just buying it  no and I think that's main answer to to the question is you have to think when you enter  the system you really have to think you know why do I want this is it just because it's  cheaper than supermarket I don't know whether that's the right the only the only argument  to step in thanks yeah thank you I'm working there but I don't know where he's angry yeah  
**[0:37:58-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:37:58):**  he's on my left I have one question here I remember from one of the podcast was kern  that you mentioned that one of the difficult one of the challenges is to find these farmers  who are actually capable of handing mop handling multiple crops and livestock and all these  together my question is what are you doing to to identify these farmers train these farmers  and how how do you scale that thank you for your question yes we see that now we have  
**[0:38:46-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:38:46):**  about seven farms up and running that it's that there is a lot of farmers think rethinking  it over so what was a difficulty might be not as difficult in future as it was in the  beginning because the examples are coming right now so what we have right now is we  we developed this let's say a training program right now we have two groups of 10 farmers  running it like for example the farmer from obelisk is one of the first members of the  
**[0:39:23-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:39:23):**  first training group so she's also one of the the victim how to say the kind of a victim  the guinea pig the guinea pig yeah we are really trying to find out what to teach what  not what can they bring up themselves etc so we don't want to pronounce the word as  a course it's not a course it's a training you know and in a training program you're  exchanging your experiences so we are having right now 20 farmers joining the program in  
**[0:39:54-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:39:54):**  two groups of 10 and the second group is already more focused on their here before because  in the beginning we also had to start the program as a program because we need some  income you know so there are also participants not wanting to become a here but wanted to  have some education on how to do sustainable farming but the second group is already a  group who 100 of the members is going to be a here a farmer so it's going to be the father  
**[0:40:26-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:40:26):**  they come from concrete projects that are somewhere in that pipeline of starting they're  one of the 33 farms that is going to start in the next exactly a year and a half and  they need to be trained so they have a very strong and they probably have a very strong  connection to their piece of land or there it's not there exactly and that makes they  know they know what their need to farm they know what kind of soil they're going to be  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:40:45):**  at exactly and they know and they also need they also know what to what their needs are  you know i want to have more information on this or that or how do i this or that so and  how did you find these farmers like how did you they came out of the community of breda  where where emmy is or yeah in in in the the example of breda yes that's one of the initiative  takers of breda it's now their it's now their farmer um but what we do is mostly post our  
**[0:41:18-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:41:18):**  our needs for farmers just over social media you know and then there is a reaction um we  are not looking specific in traditional um farm farmers uh platforms or existing farmer  platforms because when farmers can reach us over social media they are more into society  so to speak uh and that's what we need you know people who can also communicate so what  we get we mostly get them from uh the network you know we we know them or uh people in the  
**[0:41:49-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:41:49):**  local initiatives know their farmer um and then we gather them in info uh like one big  information meeting um you're wanting to be the farmer on one of our farms this is what  it is like and then they have to decide to because it's very very fundamentally different  from your normal potato or a single crop or a double crop farmer as you have a celery  and you have 200 families that are looking over your shoulder and also the techniques  
**[0:42:19-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:42:19):**  of course you know you probably you're good at producing vegetables but you never have  been working with animals you know or vice versa so that's that's that's that's what  what is happening but um what we do is uh we really want them to incorporate what they  are going to do so we start with what we call the boots camp so it's not a boot camp it's  a boots camp and we start with a with a weekend so the group of farmers is amongst each other  
**[0:42:46-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:42:46):**  uh for uh three or four uh two or three days uh and spend the night together as well you  know and we do that for a reason with it to start there we really give them an overload  of information you know and we also want to see how can they handle that how can they  handle the overload of information it's not that we think that they have to take that  they have to remember everything we tell them but we want to create a kind of oh this is  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:43:15):**  much how am I going to deal with this no so it's kind of overload that's one so we can  see what we have to do and how they react on it what we have to do on content and how  they react on it and on the other hand spending a night together and after after dinner and  have some good beers there is a lot of talking you know the community is one of the biggest  goals we are uh we we have with this training program know each other create a safe space  
**[0:43:42-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:43:42):**  that you can ask every question you want to ask in this group of farmers because that's  what is necessary and there is a little culture here like okay I know it myself and I'm getting  my answers and what we try to do is to create a community with a real safe space of farmers  and so that start within a very intensive weekend and then we uh based on what we gather  on information we start developing the program coloring in the the program so that is and  
**[0:44:18-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:44:18):**  then it's one year of training two days each month and after that we have a group with  farmers who are able to and I'm really telling this doing this this way who are about able  to run the farm but after that there is a lifelong learning and what we see right now  there is a lot of to do with on whatsapp groups the farmers on the seven farms they find each  other what did you do like this where did you get that what machinery do you use and  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:44:51):**  so it's it's more the community after the entrance through the training program who's  got to do this they have to find out a lot.  And just a quick question from Cindy what's more or less the the salary I mean it's it's  a proper full-time and let's say Dutch salary or part-time how does that work?  Yeah it depends on how the farms do want to do I have farms for example the farm in nearby  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:45:18):**  Eindhoven they are working with two farmers so one of them is working four days and the  other one is working three days so they have a seven days.  But there's enough money in the concept I think that that's the there's enough you've  made the calculation to pay a farmer full-time if that's necessary to run the farm yeah normal  salary that he or she doesn't have to take an outside job.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:45:41):**  Yeah and we can be clear about that in like I said they can earn about 45,000 per year.  Which is a good salary in a sense.  Yeah that's about and that's about a double income they have would have had when they  would have been the farmer on a own farm.  The farmer themselves yeah.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:46:02):**  With all the risks.  And in terms of Heronboo and itself you are are you set up like a cooperative and and  how does Heronboo itself help to to scale and grow and pay for the office behind you  etc.  Yeah exactly what we are right now is a foundation.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:46:21):**  So you help these initiatives to at some point because it's good to understand many of these  initiatives get started they have a certain set of steps which you have set out like you  need to find five people to start it they need to get to a hundred and there are I don't  know how many steps 15, 20 and at some point Heronboo and foundation gets involved to help  you design a farm help you to find the location but the first bit is done by and actually  
**[0:46:45-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:46:45):**  last bit as well by all the strong local energy.  Exactly and that's where it has to come from because that's the energy then it's their  farm you know but but somewhere let's say somewhere and we can could also deep dive  that but we somewhere we get involved and then we we make this then we start meeting  it making appointments on how our this involvement is connected to the central organization like  
**[0:47:10-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:47:10):**  right now it's the foundation and at the end of the year it should be a top cooperative  so that all the farms are a member of the cooperative Heerboer Netherlands.  So the foundation will have another role to play but what we need it is that what I really  want is that the member on the individual member on an edge of an individual farm has  an influence on what the national organization does and we couldn't start that earlier like  
**[0:47:40-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:47:40):**  a cooperative of co-ops you know because I really wanted to have this critical mass because  when we have a critical mass there is also a correction factor so to speak you know the  group is big enough to let's for example say someone says okay let's let's start using  chemicals could be something as someone brings up and I want to be I wanted the group big  enough to not fall for that so do not fall for that and right now we are at that stage  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:48:12):**  so at the end of this year there should be a cooperative of cooperatives.  And how many farms should you have at the end of the year just to I mean depending on  virus craziness and other things?  Of course but I think right now we have seven and I want to I think we can add at the end  of the year we can add two or three more.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:48:29):**  And then next year another?  Four to eight what we calculate right now is four to eight per year to establish.  Very cool and Jan had a question how does the farmer who manages to land deal with the  fact that he or she doesn't own it and yeah basically is not the entrepreneur farmer the  hero and the tractor I mean he or she is the hero and the tractor but the one that decides  
**[0:48:54-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:48:54):**  everything and wakes up in the morning and what's that psychology piece like?  Yeah we always put it like this you know the economically ownership of the farm is in the  hand of the members yeah so that they are they own the economically part of the farm  the entity you know.  The land is not necessarily owned by them so there is also a land owner who has some  
**[0:49:20-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:49:20):**  how do you call it now he's the let's skip that he's the owner you have the owner you  have the economically owners and you have the felt ownership of the farm and the felt  ownership should be in the hands of the farm farmer.  So we arranged this in the following way I think 95% of every decision taken on a day-to-day  basis should be taken by the farmer so he has to have this conversation with the board  
**[0:49:54-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:49:54):**  of his specific cooperative on where is how far can I go how much money can I spend per  decision which kind of decisions do you want me to get back to you to and so it's I think  it's 90 95% that should be taken on a daily day base with the farmer it's himself and  then the 5% is 5 to 10% it's necessary to go back to the board and within that amount  of questions there is amount the board gets got to get back to the members and when we  
**[0:50:29-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:50:29):**  when you do agree on this on this three layer decision letter you can reconsider it every  year in the gathering of all the members so what we what we really advise to the members  of the farm or the board members and the farmer is okay take at the end of the year when the  work in the field is not as as hard and that's not as much as in the summer take that time  to reconsider your decision letter and so are you still content with what is it satisfying  
**[0:51:10-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:51:10):**  you is it working etc so it's about the felt ownership you know as long as you are feeling  that it's your farm and you can service the people who own the farm but it feels like  your farm is your decision it's your animals it's your work it's your tractor you know  up till now it's going pretty well but what you see what you also see is that the board  members are really pleased in being a board member so they're almost taking over the farm  
**[0:51:43-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:51:43):**  and people who are not even connected in one way or another into the agricultural sector  are really deep diving and learning a lot and they're even so enthusiastic that they  take over the farm from the farmer so that's that's something we right now we are also  going to have a training program for board members to make sure that this is not that  this is still connected to each other you know this is the responsibility from the farmer  
**[0:52:07-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:52:07):**  this is yours as a board member it has to be a really especially in tough times as i  mean i remember you had a drought i think we had a drought last year and the year before  in netherlands and there were certain diseases coming from from chickens and coming by chickens  and you had to make tough decisions or the members and the board had to make tough decisions  to harvest all the chickens earlier because we didn't want to put them inside because  
**[0:52:33-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:52:33):**  it was by law suddenly the chickens had to be inside or to not plan certain things because  of drought at the end i think it comes down to the ownership like do you feel ownership  and do you make long-term decisions on okay do i want a crop next year thus should i do  certain things now and i want to be conscious of your time we have four minutes left i want  to see if there's any final questions i'm pointing around me the people that didn't  
**[0:52:55-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:52:55):**  ask anything yet and otherwise obviously there are feel free other people to jump in as well  i see no i see nicholas yeah sure let me just to say something um no i'm i'm really uh i'm  really uh impressed by the the concept and i'm also impressed by the way you're by the  fact that you're able to find the good farmers because this is something that we're really  uh struggling in our in our project to find people who are inspired but also got common  
**[0:53:30-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:53:30):**  sense good good some of some experience and some also uh appetite not to jump in but just  to to be able to to stay in the business because we see lots of projects for example in belgium  where they start producing fruit vegetables and and many of those projects are now stopping  just because of people and the guys were managing that are not capable economically or manually  or agronomically so i think it's a very uh very uh very interesting to to see that and  
**[0:54:06-0:54:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:54:06):**  i had a question regarding um when you have 20 hectares um it's quite a lot of land of  course for one person or one or two person even if there is some help from from the the  community um i i suppose that you're producing not only vegetables on this land but there  is also some sort of not commodity but grain or other stuff just to rotate or um to manage  that properly is there a project with those lower value crop or grain crop if i if i can  
**[0:54:38-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:54:38):**  say do you have something behind that you mean some kind of transformation yeah um out  of the high value crop i would say would you make pasta and bread and flour would you yeah  uh yes of course um we have been working on this program for our own bread and so with  with grains or something to to produce but here is the quality really coming in you know  the fact is that that's for example in france they make better they grow better grains than  
**[0:55:18-0:55:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:55:18):**  we can do in the netherlands so what you see right now is that we use the grains in our  rotation in our crop rotation you know that's because that's better for soil etc etc and  for diseases so we are we're already producing some but we're putting it back in the soil  for soil quality right now uh and i think uh once soil quality is back in order um i  think we can use it for consumption right now everything we produce what we have to  
**[0:55:45-0:55:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:55:45):**  work very hard on soil quality and we need every uh in crop rotation we need this kind  of product but what we do is we just put it back into the soil do you feed it to animals  as well like your chickens etc or that's still tricky no no no we do that already you know  but we do that with uh sun sunflowers that's what we produce as well um so the flower is  given to the chicken but the rest of the plant is going to back into it yeah because this  
**[0:56:16-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:56:16):**  is really something that uh of course for agronomical reason but also for impact reason  this is something we are interested in uh in belgium in any of our different projects  at soil capital how do we transform the large-scale farming around us because of course horticulture  is part of the solution but i think that this kind of project that you're developing uh  could also in the future have some link with people who are producing commodities around  
**[0:56:44-0:56:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:56:44):**  those projects to connect those people and to have an impact not only on the on a few  hectares but on on what we see when you travel on the on the highway on the left and on the  right it's most of the time grain and and and large-scale farming or it was just uh  to put that on the table yeah exactly one last remark i think it's really hard to transform  existing farms i think this because there is also an economical factor behind it there  
**[0:57:12-0:57:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:57:12):**  is a cultural factor behind it there are a lot of factors that it makes it not easy to  transform so i think there is an existing pillar of food production and we are going  we are coming from besides no and i think that makes it a little bit easier but um it's  really we have been thinking on transforming but that's really hard that's really hard  yeah and with that note sorry sorry guys i know here it has a hard stop so i don't want  
**[0:57:38-0:57:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:57:38):**  to keep him too much thank you so much all for calling in joining in thank you first  of all foremost obviously here for making time this early morning and for everybody  around from hong kong to copenhagen to um i think you're in belgium nicholas and obviously  brita so thank you so much for calling in asking your questions sharing and see you  next time and thank you for listening to me thank you very much thank you thank you bye

**[0:58:30-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:58:30):**  and recording this podcast since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned what  have we seen in the space over the last years how have we built our decision making framework  what to focus on with the podcast how have we picked interviewees and what questions  should you ask what is happening in the space what should you read what should you listen  what should you watch how to approach this space for whom is this course you the soil  
**[0:58:57-0:59:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:58:57):**  builders and investors in this space the soil builders people working in this space entrepreneurial  farmers fund managers vehicle builders crowd investing platform builders agtech companies  farm to gut food companies permaculture key line designers holistic management consultants  etc etc people that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own  money to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are  
**[0:59:21-0:59:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:59:21):**  putting other people's money to work through foundations institutional capital banks insurance  companies etc is this course free no this is pay what you think it's worth meaning i  have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and i'm very aware that among  the listeners of this podcast and we have people with very different means so i'm inviting  you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to consider paying  
**[0:59:48-0:59:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=0:59:48):**  what you think it's worth thank you so what is this course it's currently a series of  seventeen videos mostly ranging from ten to fifteen minutes plus pdf slides so you don't  have to ride along we're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why  extractive agriculture is so risky how to invest what kind of frameworks you could and  i think should build what to invest in what kind of co-investors you could find or what  
**[1:00:14-1:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/webinars/#t=1:00:14):**  kind of investors you could find if you're a soil builder every lesson will have a digging  deeper part where i will share what kind of reports what kind of interviews what kind  of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper we're going to look at nutrient  density landscape design and a lot more so what is it not it's not a list of investable  deals unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world we're really at the beginning of

**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:00:20):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:00:21):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:00:31):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:00:44):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:00:53):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:00:58-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:00:58):**  our work.

**[0:01:18-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:18):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:19):**  Welcome to another interview.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:20):**  Today a check in interview with the co-founder of Teak Origin, a food data company which  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:24):**  enables businesses and consumers to answer critical questions about their food.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:28):**  When is the right time to harvest?  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:30):**  What are the post-harvest conversion nutrient levels?  
**[0:01:33-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:33):**  Are we getting what we're paying for?  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:34):**  And how can food be used as its own label?  
**[0:01:37-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:37):**  And much more.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:38):**  We interviewed Greg more than a year ago, and I'm very, very happy he's back.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:42):**  He's one of the most listened episodes we have.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:44):**  And I'm looking forward to check in with them and see where this whole nutrient density discussion  
**[0:01:49-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:49):**  has been going over the past year.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:51):**  So welcome back, Greg.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:52):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:53):**  It's good to be back again.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:01:55):**  And to start with a short reminder for whoever listened to the episode last time or maybe  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:01):**  didn't, and I will obviously link it below.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:04):**  What is Teak Origin?  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:06):**  Essentially what we're doing is we're building the world's most up to date reference for  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:09):**  nutrition.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:10):**  And the reason why we're doing that is because until now there really hasn't been a scalable  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:16):**  or an easy way to measure the nutrient density in our food.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:20):**  Of course, in the past, you could always send food off to a laboratory to be analyzed and  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:24):**  it would be expensive and it would take a lot of time.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:26):**  Of course, it destroys the food, but none of that information ever got aggregated.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:30):**  And so it would always be done for a specific client or a specific need, but we never got  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:35):**  to see that information compiled and compared to one another.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:39):**  So essentially what we've been working on now for a number of years is we do the lab  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:45):**  work that you would normally do in a lab, but then we translate that into the field  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:50):**  so that a user, a non-technical user, whether it be on the farm or in a warehouse or in  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:54):**  the back of a store, can basically take an instrument and scan an item of food and within  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:02:59):**  a few seconds understand very accurately what the nutrient density of that particular food  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:04):**  is.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:05):**  So basically without me, let's say I'm working in the back of a big supermarket and a big  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:11):**  pallet of apples comes in.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:13):**  Without me taking a slice of the apple, sending it to a lab, waiting for the result, etc.,  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:17):**  what you're allowing me to do is that I have a small handheld device scan a slice of the  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:22):**  apple or whatever way that works.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:24):**  And because of the lab work you've done before, it gives me basically the context of the apple.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:29):**  It gives me where that apple lands in terms of nutrients.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:32):**  Is that a fair example?  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:33):**  Yeah, that's a great example.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:34):**  And I think it's really important to say that what we're doing differently, and we've only  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:39):**  learned this the hard way because we didn't start it out this way, is we're doing the  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:43):**  chemistry piece of that.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:44):**  And so we tried to sort of overcome the chemistry challenge of having to do the lab work, but  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:50):**  what we quickly realized is that nowhere in the world did it exist, you know, an accurate  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:54):**  source of information.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:55):**  So even if you could take an image of that apple, or even if you could use some form  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:03:59):**  of AI, the information that we were comparing it to was essentially garbage.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:04):**  And so we've had to go and do the chemistry and build this updated reference so that you  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:08):**  can indeed do what you just described.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:10):**  And in that case, it's good enough that I just scan the apple with a device and I'm  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:14):**  not doing the chemistry part.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:16):**  How come you make it possible that I don't have to send this slice of the apple to the  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:19):**  lab?  
**[0:04:20-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:20):**  So an apple is a good example.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:21):**  So we'll take an apple and in the case of apples, we have to actually go to the variety  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:23):**  level.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:24):**  So we'll say gal apples, and we'll identify, let's say, maybe there's 200 things inside  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:29):**  of an apple that can be measured in terms of nutrients.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:32):**  But in reality, a handful of those things really matter.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:35):**  Nutrients and moisture and vitamin C and malic acid, and in some cases, it's fats or antioxidants  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:40):**  and other foods, but it's number 300.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:42):**  It's usually eight to 20.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:44):**  We'll identify what those key nutrients are.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:47):**  Then we just go into our lab and we'll analyze hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of samples  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:50):**  of gal apples in this particular example, until we understand the chemistry as good  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:55):**  as any other food lab does.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:04:57):**  We take that information and we translate it to data models.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:01):**  And there's two types of models.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:02):**  There is a classifier model that allows us to identify that this indeed is a gal apple  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:06):**  without us having to tell an instrument or a user that it is.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:10):**  And then if we say, okay, hey, I know this is a gal apple, then the next type of model  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:14):**  is a prediction model.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:15):**  Now that I know this is a gal apple, I'm going to go ahead and make a prediction of those  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:19):**  individual nutrients that I've studied so diligently in the lab.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:23):**  And this instrument that we use, it's a handheld spectrometer.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:27):**  It's a multi-channel spectrometer, industrial grade.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:30):**  It's not one of these, you know, some of these consumer devices that you see out there.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:34):**  And by the way, we don't make the device.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:35):**  It's an off the shelf instrument made by other instrument companies.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:39):**  It gives you about 93 to 98, depending on the situation, percent accuracy to what you  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:45):**  would normally see in the lab.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:47):**  So that's great for nutrient density.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:50):**  You don't need to be at a hundred percent for nutrient density because today we're at  
**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:53):**  zero.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:54):**  So it's far better, exponentially better than what we have today.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:05:56):**  Now, what we wouldn't claim is we wouldn't want to look for allergens or pesticides or  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:01):**  things like that, because hey, 93% isn't good enough in those cases.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:05):**  So this is why we're focused right now on nutritional density.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:08):**  And it basically tells you this apple is, so we identified what type of apple, what  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:13):**  variety, and then it tells you compared to the others, it's relatively full of nutrients  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:18):**  or it's at its peak or its top.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:20):**  What does it tell you in that prediction model?  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:22):**  It'll compare it to a standard.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:24):**  So when we build the models, we default to the USDA standard just because we're a US  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:28):**  company, but in reality you can compare it to any standard.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:30):**  So we've compared it to the French nutrition label standard, UK, some companies have their  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:36):**  own standards in terms of quality that we can compare it to.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:39):**  So essentially what you'll say is, Hey, here's what we think is actually in this apple.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:43):**  And Hey, here's what the standard, whatever standard that might be says is supposed to  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:46):**  be there.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:47):**  Here's the difference.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:49):**  So it says there's supposed to be so many milligrams of vitamin C or you know, this  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:53):**  level of glucose or sucrose or this amount of moisture or antioxidants.  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:58):**  And here's what's actually there.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:06:59):**  And it gives you the individual differences between those two things.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:03):**  And then it gives you an overall score.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:04):**  It says, Hey, based on the levels of these nutrients, Hey, we think that this Gala apple  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:09):**  is about 76% of what you expect to be inside of a Gala apple, depending on that standard.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:15):**  And do you see like me being in the back of the supermarket with this palette of apples,  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:19):**  a huge variety, like a huge difference in different apples of that same box or that  
**[0:07:25-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:25):**  same palette or that same shipment.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:27):**  Is that important or is that relevant?  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:29):**  Have you seen that?  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:30):**  I mean your work with supermarkets?  
**[0:07:32-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:32):**  Not really.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:33):**  So I don't have to scan a hundred.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:34):**  Nope.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:35):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:37):**  You can scan, you know, 10 and that's a good point because you know, you could scan one  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:39):**  and the user will get a real time answer to say, okay, Hey, here's the nutrient density  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:43):**  of this particular apple, which is interesting, but far more interesting is sort of how that  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:48):**  apple then compares to all the other apples being scanned around the world.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:52):**  So the aggregated data is becoming much more interesting to retailers in that particular  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:57):**  case than it is that individual apple.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:07:59):**  But that's right.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:00):**  You can scan one or you can scan 10 and that's again, far more accurate than what you're  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:03):**  doing today.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:04):**  And then the question is where do those differences come from?  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:08):**  Well, so that's the question that we need to answer.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:11):**  So phase one of Teak Origin has been all about sort of establishing the baseline.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:16):**  So that baseline has been how accurate are the existing sources of information, meaning  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:21):**  nutrition labels or retailer websites.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:25):**  And probably the answer is not very accurate.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:26):**  That's right.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:27):**  I think it was the title of the last interview.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:29):**  There are hardly any nutrients in your food left or something like that.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:33):**  Of course, went for a nice one, but it was more or less the conclusion of the interview.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:36):**  And then how well are, you know, major supermarkets, which of course is the primary way we mostly  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:41):**  get our fresh foods, how well are they delivering nutrition and at what price?  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:45):**  And then how does where something is produced determine nutrient density?  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:50):**  So those are kind of the first things we wanted to look at, which we've been collecting now  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:53):**  hundreds of thousands.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:54):**  And the freshness, if I remember correctly from that interview, saying that the faster  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:08:59):**  moving supermarkets in general, but that was obviously before you were releasing a lot  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:02):**  of data, like the fresher the fruit in this case and the vegetables in many cases, the  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:08):**  better the amount of the more amount of nutrients left because freshness is something that just  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:13):**  goes away very, very quickly and the nutrients go with that.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:16):**  That's right.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:18):**  Once the food is harvested, it's essentially degrading.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:19):**  And so it's, you know, it's a race against time essentially.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:21):**  And of course, how it's stored and how it shipped, those things all have an impact on  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:24):**  it.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:25):**  But ultimately it's a race against time.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:27):**  And so the first phase has been, let's get to the update part.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:31):**  You've been very busy.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:32):**  I mean, if you look at the website, you're publishing the big database and research that  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:36):**  we talked about last time, but it wasn't live yet when we were recording.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:40):**  And also when we released it on comparing a lot of fruits and vegetables in US supermarkets,  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:45):**  but also in France and Canada, if I'm right, can you share a bit about that?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:49):**  Quite a big project and quite an ambitious one.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:51):**  So not Canada yet.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:52):**  So we're doing the top 18 supermarkets in the US.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:54):**  We just launched last month in the UK.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:09:56):**  So we're doing all the supermarkets and online delivery services in the UK only because it's  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:01):**  a smaller market.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:02):**  And then we've done a couple of special projects in France and then we'll do Singapore.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:08):**  We were going to launch Singapore next month, but we decided to wait till after through  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:11):**  the holidays and do that in January.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:14):**  And the reason why we're doing Singapore, the US and UK is those are obviously interesting,  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:18):**  what we'd call beachheads to enter into these regional markets.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:22):**  But more importantly, by choosing those three locations, we now will have a snapshot of  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:27):**  produce from 90% of the countries where these foods are produced.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:32):**  So we'll have the most complete global picture of the top produce items in the world.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:37):**  And when you say we do that country or we do the top 18 supermarkets like in the US,  
**[0:10:42-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:42):**  what does it actually mean?  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:43):**  So our teams every day just go out as you would as a shopper.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:47):**  And we walk into all these different stores around the countries and we just buy these  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:51):**  foods and we buy a minimum each time we go of 10 samples of each type of food at the  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:57):**  different retailers.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:10:58):**  And then we bring them back in the era of COVID, either to our homes and or a central  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:03):**  office and we use that instrument that you and I just talked about a few seconds ago  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:08):**  to measure the nutrient density of all these foods.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:11):**  And then all that information gets combined on a daily and weekly basis.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:15):**  So we've started at the market level, hey, what's being delivered?  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:19):**  Now we then sort of aggregate all the information and then we go to retailers and we say, hey,  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:24):**  here is the state of nutrition for your fruits and vegetables, but also the rest of the market.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:29):**  So your top competitors.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:31):**  And so here's how well you're doing against the market.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:34):**  Inevitably they'll have questions like you just asked.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:36):**  Well, OK, well, why are some of these things happening?  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:39):**  And then that leads to a follow on piece of work with that particular retailer or retailers  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:44):**  to say, OK, well, now let's dig into your supply chain and figure out where this is  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:47):**  breaking down faster than we're expecting, because we obviously don't.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:51):**  So that's the business model here.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:53):**  Like you're we talked about it last time as well.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:11:55):**  You might bring some bad news to some of these players, but also giving them the opportunity  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:00):**  to with you, obviously digging into their supply chain to start finding why their apples  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:05):**  or their avocados are not at par with their top competitors.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:10):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:11):**  Yes.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:12):**  And how has been the response so far of supermarkets?  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:14):**  I think overall it's been very positive.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:16):**  I think people are keen to have this information.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:18):**  It's unique insights that they haven't been able to see before.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:21):**  There are kind of two things that if you can say retailers have an emotional response,  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:25):**  the two things that have evoked sort of the most emotional responses have been the comparison  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:30):**  of nutrient density over price.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:32):**  That always gets everyone's attention because there's some surprises there.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:36):**  Like retailers, like maybe we talked about before, that aren't known for quality, if  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:41):**  you will, or freshness, but are known for their price.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:44):**  They're actually delivering high levels of nutrition versus the competitors that are  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:49):**  known to have higher quality products.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:51):**  So that's a surprise to a lot of people.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:53):**  Yeah, I think we discussed that whole foods versus the faster moving ones like Walmart  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:12:59):**  or Aldi as they sell fast, meaning their stuff is generally more fresh and thus holding more  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:06):**  nutrients in showing in this research.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:09):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:10):**  Which is surprising.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:11):**  But it's also, I think the one thing that we've learned over this, I mean on this whole  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:15):**  journey, but certainly the last year with getting as much data as we've collected so  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:18):**  far is it's really complex.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:21):**  It's complicated.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:22):**  There are no really straightforward answers.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:24):**  So like we were just looking at blueberries the other day and we compared winter blueberries  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:28):**  through the months of January and February in both the UK and the US.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:32):**  And most of those blueberries were from South America, as you'd imagine, because it's the  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:36):**  season there.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:37):**  Of course, so they're being shipped thousands of miles to the end market.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:41):**  And those blueberries were far more nutritious than summer blueberries were in the same markets,  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:46):**  even though most of the blueberries were sort of locally or regionally sourced.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:50):**  So most of the blueberries in the US were US grown blueberries over the summer and the  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:13:55):**  UK, they were either UK blueberries and overall nutrition was quite a bit higher in the winter.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:01):**  And like things like vitamin C, which are great, it's a great indicator of how something  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:06):**  is surviving the supply chain journey was almost 2x.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:11):**  So things like that are just sort of counterintuitive that we never expect to see.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:15):**  And so anyway, to your question, these things are really interesting to the retailers.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:19):**  And then when you start digging, what do you find?  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:21):**  Like are there different types, different ways of growing them?  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:25):**  Because yeah, you expect the long distance to destroy most of nutrients.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:29):**  In this case, it's not happening.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:31):**  So what we saw in that one example, blueberries, they were leaving the farms, if you will,  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:38):**  in Chile with higher levels of nutrients to begin with.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:42):**  And because they are in the business of exporting 100% of their products to far points in the  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:47):**  world, they had an extremely efficient supply chain.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:49):**  So they were just getting to the end markets efficiently and quickly.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:55):**  So that just seemed like that was partly the reason.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:14:58):**  Whereas in the case of the US, there were other modes of transportation.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:02):**  So maybe it wasn't air or fast ship, it was trucking, maybe stored extra time.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:07):**  It would go from small farm to consolidator, consolidator to major warehouse for big retailers  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:14):**  and then that major warehouse to more stores.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:17):**  So there were just more touch points for whatever reason in locally produced things.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:21):**  But then you look at something else and it's completely different.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:24):**  And of course, for large supermarkets who are carrying so many different items, it's  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:28):**  a never ending story, but a very interesting one.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:30):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:31):**  And we touched upon it last time and I don't know if you have made, I mean, it's been a  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:36):**  crazy year, obviously, the connection to which obviously we discussed a lot on this podcast  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:40):**  to soil health, soil management or the farming side of things.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:44):**  Have you made any steps there in going all the way down through the supply chain to see,  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:50):**  okay, why maybe these blueberries left with a higher level of nutrients to begin with  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:54):**  or on the apple side of things or avocado side of things?  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:15:57):**  Have you been looking into the soil side of things at all?  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:16:00):**  Or is that something that's on the agenda for the coming years?  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:16:05):**  That's right.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:16:06):**  That's part of the next phase is now how do production methods, shipping and storage methods,  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:16:10):**  how do they influence nutrient density and the degradation of nutrition?  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:16:15):**  But we do have a lot more information and insights than we had the last time we talked.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:16:18):**  So this summer we had a chance to study organic strawberries from Vermont farms here in New  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:16:24):**  England where we're located.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:16:25):**  And it was interesting because on average, so I'll speak in general terms to save time,  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:16:31):**  those organic strawberries were 100% more nutritious than what was expected to be there.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:16:38):**  So data that we've seen from other strawberries and or the nutrition label that was twice  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:16:44):**  as much of the key nutrients were present.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:16:47):**  In the case of the French tomatoes that we've recently looked at over the summer and in  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:16:50):**  some cases US tomatoes and biologic and organic equivalent, they were on average about 80%  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:16:57):**  more nutritious right off the farm than what you'd expect to be there.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:02):**  And then just in the last few days, because it's still apple season, again, in both France  
**[0:17:06-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:06):**  and the US, we've seen apples that are 422% right off the farm more nutritious than the  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:13):**  expectations.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:14):**  So what you would expect on the label.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:17):**  And those expectations, are they based on organic apples or that's the general US or  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:22):**  France label?  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:23):**  Okay, this is what this type of apple should be because we've done some lab work a long  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:29):**  time ago.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:30):**  Yep, just the general.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:31):**  So basically the basic models, like the labels are like what we expect is generally quite  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:35):**  far off.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:36):**  Is that a conclusion we can draw?  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:37):**  Well, it is, but then what's then sort of discouraging or what we have to dig into now  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:42):**  with both ourselves as a company, but also now our retail partners, is that when you  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:47):**  look at those same foods, now, of course, it's not the same food, meaning from the same  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:50):**  supplier, you know, the same actual pieces of fruit, but the same type of food, strawberries,  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:55):**  tomatoes and apples in the supermarket.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:17:57):**  So when you look at organic, from the major supermarkets, we see almost no differences  
**[0:18:03-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:03):**  between conventional and organic.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:05):**  So by the time it's gone through these big supply chains, they've sort of been equalized  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:09):**  for whatever reason.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:10):**  And I can't tell you why today, because what you were mentioning before was a farm, so  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:14):**  on the farm, actually immediately like harvested tomato, harvested apple and measured there.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:20):**  And you're saying when it gets to your organic supermarket or the organic aisle in your supermarket,  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:26):**  most of the difference, like the 420% difference or all the other is basically has disappeared.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:31):**  And we don't know why yet, which is a crucial question because you're producing more nutrients  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:35):**  as a farmer and those nutrients never get to the plate.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:39):**  That's right.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:40):**  So you're not getting credit for doing this great work of producing these foods.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:44):**  Some of that's natural.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:45):**  I mean, so obviously nutrients degrade over time once it leaves the bush or the tree or  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:49):**  the farm, but obviously it's degrading in some cases at much faster rates than it should  
**[0:18:54-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:54):**  be.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:18:55):**  And so sort of that's the next Holy Grail moment of figuring out why and where, and  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:00):**  then being able to fix that.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:02):**  And yeah, unless we go and harvest ourselves and eat it straight off the tree or the plant,  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:06):**  which won't happen anytime soon, we need to figure out how to get those nutrients to our  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:11):**  doorsteps.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:12):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:13):**  And what's interesting is this isn't organic or regenerative practices, but something else  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:17):**  we discovered in the last few months around avocados, because you had mentioned avocados.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:21):**  Just because I saw them on your website, not because they are always on my mind, but yeah.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:27):**  Well, I mean, but they're all the rage now, right?  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:28):**  I mean, hey, it's, you know, it's a healthy food and you see them everywhere now.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:31):**  Everyone's talking about avocados and how hard they are to get and how expensive they  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:34):**  are.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:35):**  So over the last few years, as fat has no longer been sort of enemy number one and people  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:40):**  have started to eat healthy fats, of course, we've been producing avocados to have more  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:44):**  of those unsaturated fatty acids in them and it's worked.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:48):**  So we're seeing much, much higher levels of healthy fats inside of avocados than the previous  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:55):**  lab work was done 20 years ago.  
**[0:19:58-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:58):**  So that's good news.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:19:59):**  But the unintended consequences of that are that the calorie count in avocados now is  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:05):**  more than 2x.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:06):**  Okay.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:07):**  Wait, basically you're saying that it's great because we get more of the good fat.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:11):**  The reason why we eat avocados over there in all the nutrient books and the diets, et  
**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:15):**  cetera, is there's much more.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:17):**  We've been growing avocados for more of those fats, which is great, but obviously the amount  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:21):**  of calories that we count in avocado too, if you're counting calories has been based  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:27):**  on like 20 year old research and that's also completely off.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:30):**  Completely.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:31):**  So if you're using a nutrition app or you're Googling how many calories are in avocado  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:34):**  or you're using a retailer website or the nutrition label, you're saying, okay, well,  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:38):**  hey, I'm going to eat this avocado on my toast and I get 300 calories.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:41):**  Great.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:42):**  In reality, you're probably getting close to 700 calories for that medium sized avocado.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:46):**  And so again, not saying don't eat avocados, but these are things that need to be updated  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:51):**  and we need to know these things to factor into what we're actually putting into our  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:54):**  bodies.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:55):**  Cause that's a massive.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:56):**  I mean, you could be doing your perfect diet you think because you're tracking it in your  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:20:59):**  app, et cetera.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:00):**  And actually you're eating, you're getting more than two X the amount of calories in,  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:05):**  which obviously ruins your calorie count if you would be counting your calories.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:08):**  Well, that's right.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:09):**  Even if you're not counting calories, if you ate two avocados in a day and got 1400 calories,  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:13):**  I mean, I mean we can only consume so many calories even if you're not conscious of it.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:18):**  So yeah, that's a big deal.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:19):**  It's a big deal.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:20):**  And that's only the avocado, which is all the rage, but still not our staple food.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:25):**  Imagine others that are way more consumed and potentially also quite off in terms of  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:31):**  nutrients, but also in terms of calories.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:32):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:33):**  Sometimes we'll talk to folks in the academic world or nutritionists.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:37):**  We have a nutritionist on staff and we'll talk about vitamin C and apples a lot.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:41):**  And they'll always look at us and say, well, no one measures vitamin C and apples.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:44):**  We don't think about vitamin C when we think about apples.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:47):**  But the reality is in some cases we'll see apples like the example I just shared a couple  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:51):**  of minutes ago that'll have more vitamin C in them than fruits like strawberries or citrus  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:21:56):**  that we're eating specifically for vitamin C. So it's these old ways of thinking, this  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:01):**  old mentality we got to get out of.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:03):**  And what has surprised you the most over this year of releasing and also doing a lot of  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:07):**  this, releasing a lot of this data and doing a lot of this study?  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:09):**  What's been the biggest, the biggest, not aha moment, but the weirdest thing that came  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:14):**  up?  
**[0:22:15-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:15):**  I think some of these examples that I just shared with you, but I think the most revealing  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:17):**  is just how complicated this really is.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:20):**  It's you kind of hope going into this world, Hey, one is going to work.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:24):**  And then two, Hey, we're going to identify something that is a clear path to solving  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:30):**  it.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:31):**  Hey, we're just going to, if you produce it differently, if you produce it in this region  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:33):**  or in this method, or we go back to seasonal or, Hey, if you just change the way something  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:38):**  was stored or the way something was shipped, or if we can sell it faster.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:42):**  And the reality is it's messy and it's always a combination of all these different things.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:47):**  And it's slightly different for each food and maybe even each harvest.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:51):**  And so that's the next level is okay.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:53):**  Well now how do we go fix that together?  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:55):**  I think we talked about this sort of in theory, the last time we got together of, Hey, nothing  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:22:59):**  leaves the farm at a hundred percent.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:01):**  And the whole entire supply chain is built around the fact that food leaves a harvest  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:05):**  site at a hundred percent.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:06):**  And then you do some math and it degrades from there, but it leaves at 10% of what should  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:11):**  be there.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:12):**  Or sometimes it leaves at 700% of what should be there.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:14):**  And so I think that is going to become more and more important to be able to establish  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:18):**  that baseline effectively, efficiently on the farm, because then it drives every other  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:24):**  decision from that point forward.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:27):**  And it even drives it.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:28):**  I mean, it starts to drive potential price decisions as soon as your clients and others  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:32):**  are starting to say, yeah, but actually I am supposed to paying for apples to reach  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:36):**  this level.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:37):**  And I now can tell that it didn't, or at least when they arrived here, they were basically  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:42):**  empty and basically water and sugar.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:44):**  As we discussed last time, I'm still scared that interview was really changed my image  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:48):**  on apples and spinach and some other things.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:51):**  But as a supermarket, I'm paying for certain things and I'm not getting it.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:54):**  And as a farmer, that relationship changes completely, but you're going to ask a lot  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:23:58):**  of questions as soon as you can do that measurement, both on farm during the transport and also  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:03):**  at the arrival, basically at the back of the supermarket or as a huge warehouse.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:07):**  A hundred percent.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:08):**  That's absolutely right.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:09):**  I think one of the things that's been interesting to see is a lot of retailers are worried about  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:14):**  sharing this information with their customers and rightfully so.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:17):**  And we have been as well, because the last thing we want to do is send a message and  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:20):**  say, Hey, stop eating avocados or don't eat bananas or whatever.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:23):**  We don't want that to be the message.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:26):**  It's more about, Hey, this is what you're actually getting.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:28):**  And so, Hey, maybe you need to try different fruits at different times or eat more of this  
**[0:24:32-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:32):**  or less of that or whatever.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:34):**  So it's more just about having a much more detailed understanding of what we're actually  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:37):**  consuming.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:38):**  But I think what the retailers sort of underestimated was that customers liked that.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:44):**  They liked that empowerment.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:45):**  So I won't say the name of it, but a retailer that isn't known for really delivering transparency  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:53):**  and looking out for the nutrient density of their customers necessarily learned very quickly  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:24:59):**  that, Hey, just by being open and giving our consumers the ability to make their own decisions,  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:05):**  Hey, this apple is the best for pie baking.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:08):**  Hey, it may not be the most nutritious, but this might serve the purpose if that's what  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:12):**  you're coming for.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:13):**  Or, Hey, this might be the best apple to put on your child's lunch, or this might just  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:17):**  be the best overall value.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:19):**  Giving the consumer credit for that and letting them make that decision, raise the level of  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:23):**  trust in that particular retailer.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:26):**  And ultimately I think we'll have a positive impact on their business.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:29):**  So I was really telling for them and it was really telling for us that that indeed worked.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:33):**  They didn't run away and say, Oh, well now that you're being truthful, I don't want to  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:37):**  deal with you anymore.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:38):**  No, and also because if somebody else does it, if one of their top 17 competitors does  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:42):**  it and they don't and people shop at different places, if they can, they will start asking  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:46):**  questions because you probably want to at least know, but it's encouraging to see that  
**[0:25:50-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:50):**  consumers at least, even if it's ends up being a relatively empty apple, they appreciate  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:57):**  the openness.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:25:58):**  And in terms of this is all being fresh produce, et cetera.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:02):**  Have you done any work?  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:03):**  I don't know that, or are you planning any work on the processed food side?  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:07):**  Like as soon as it stops being an apple and turns into something else before we buy it,  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:12):**  is that an area of interest?  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:14):**  I can imagine incredibly complex, but is that an area of interest for tick origin?  
**[0:26:18-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:18):**  Eventually?  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:19):**  Yes.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:20):**  So I think kind of the way it works, at least in our minds from a scientific standpoint,  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:24):**  is once we develop all these models for the main fresh foods, then that gives us a high  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:30):**  degree of confidence and accuracy to them to go look at processed foods that are made  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:33):**  up of a combination of these fresh foods.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:36):**  But until you understand the individual components of an apple and then you understand apples  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:40):**  and then apples go into applesauce, et cetera, et cetera, it's really impossible to get a  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:45):**  high degree of accuracy by looking at mixed foods.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:48):**  Now you can do it in the lab, of course, you can prepare samples and do all kinds of removing  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:52):**  the moisture and things like that.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:53):**  But from a field interrogation standpoint, we're not there yet.  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:57):**  But that is absolutely on our radar screen.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:26:59):**  And we think that we'll be able to do that someday or somebody will.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:03):**  That sounds extremely important, especially as there's a lot of discussion, obviously,  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:08):**  on processed food in general and how the processing, of course, depends on the levels, et cetera.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:14):**  That could be one of the reasons why there's so few nutrients left.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:18):**  But obviously, until you measure and eat and until you know the different pieces, it just  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:23):**  doesn't make too much sense to actually say those things, which obviously are shared widely.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:28):**  To switch gears a bit, I've been asking this question a number of times, but I'm pretty  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:33):**  sure not when you and when we were interviewing a year ago.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:36):**  So I've been experimenting with using the ITN framework, which is used extensively in  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:41):**  effective altruism, which stands for importance, tractability and neglectiveness.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:46):**  And in terms of importance, I think we covered that also last time, like what's the scale  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:48):**  of the problem and why is it so important to focus on actually knowing what is in your  
**[0:27:52-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:52):**  food in terms of tractability?  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:54):**  Like, is it solvable?  
**[0:27:56-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:56):**  Is it fixing?  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:27:57):**  It seems like you're that's the phase two of T origin after measuring, okay, how do  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:02):**  we explain these things?  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:03):**  And are they changeable?  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:04):**  Am I right when I summarize it like that?  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:07):**  Yeah, I think that's right.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:08):**  I think that's a fair assessment.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:10):**  I'd say technologically and scientifically, it's completely solvable.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:13):**  I think these problems, the solutions exist.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:15):**  We don't need any new tech to come.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:17):**  We don't need any new tech.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:18):**  That's right.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:19):**  But as I was saying before, it's extremely complicated.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:21):**  It's complex.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:22):**  And so it's, there's not a magic silver bullet.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:24):**  It's not a magic solution that just says, okay, we've invented this, so therefore problem  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:28):**  solved.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:29):**  And it's going to take a lot of highly coordinated efforts and patience to fix some of these  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:34):**  problems.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:36):**  But you can't do any of it until you have this common language that sort of is.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:39):**  Until we agree, basically.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:41):**  Well, until we agree.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:42):**  That's right.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:43):**  So the farmer is speaking the same language as the supply chain person who's speaking  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:45):**  the same language as the store person who's speaking the same language as the consumer.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:49):**  Until that happens, I think we're all still running around like crazy and scattered and  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:53):**  there's no concentrated effort to solve this problem.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:28:56):**  And in terms of neglectfulness, which I always stumble upon, how has that shifted over the  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:01):**  last, let's say year and a month since we talked?  
**[0:29:04-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:04):**  Have you seen more?  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:05):**  I mean, I've been talking about it a lot, but obviously we live in our little bubble.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:10):**  Nutrient density.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:11):**  Have you seen changes in the discussions you're having on the consumer side, but also the  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:15):**  company side, the big retailers you talk to in terms of this focus on what is actually  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:20):**  in our food?  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:21):**  Has that shifted at all?  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:23):**  And if so, where and how?  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:25):**  Incredibly so.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:26):**  So a year ago when we were talking and having some of these.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:29):**  Always happy when that answer comes back, like not because you could also say no, not  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:32):**  at all.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:33):**  And then it's sort of false that, but it's good.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:34):**  Like, please go ahead.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:35):**  Completely.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:36):**  So yeah, Hey, a year ago and Hey, I came out of retail.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:39):**  And so the conversations that we were having with either customers or potential customers  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:43):**  were all about, Hey, will this reduce waste and save me money?  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:46):**  And can I use this tool to renegotiate contracts or Hey, can I use this tool to communicate  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:52):**  to my customers that I am indeed better than my competitors?  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:54):**  And it was very heavily commercially oriented with, Hey, no problem.  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:58):**  Maybe it's the business they're in.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:29:59):**  And ultimately if it gets better food to people, fantastic.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:03):**  When COVID hit the conversation, at least specifically around sort of being able to  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:07):**  assess nutrient density and in our specific technology, the conversation shifted to supply  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:13):**  chain resilience.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:14):**  Hey, can I qualify food and or a food supplier from somewhere else in the world without having  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:21):**  to send a team there or without having to send food to a lab?  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:23):**  Because all the food labs in the world were shut down for several months.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:27):**  So could I send one of your instruments and have a supplier assess food?  
**[0:30:30-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:30):**  I get the results and say, okay, thumbs up.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:32):**  I'll go ahead and buy this from you.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:34):**  So that was a very short period of sort of just highly reactionary moments of just trying  
**[0:30:38-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:38):**  to keep food on the shelf.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:40):**  But now in the last few months, we have seen a wholesale shift like I've never seen before  
**[0:30:45-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:45):**  with all my years in doing this towards nutrition and its direct impact on health.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:52):**  And everyone I'm talking to, whether it's on the for-profit, you know, retail side or  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:30:56):**  working with big institutions, I think the general consensus is that we're at a place  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:31:01):**  now in terms of like the importance of nutrition that everyone expected we would be in five  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:31:06):**  years or maybe even longer.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:31:09):**  So I think if one positive thing has come out of this pandemic is everyone from a business  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:31:16):**  and from a personal standpoint are really focused on improving or maintaining our health.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:31:20):**  I'm very happy to hear that because if you follow, let's say the normal news, et cetera,  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:31:25):**  I'm always discouraged about the lack of discussion on health and the connection to nutrients  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:31:31):**  and what we eat and what we don't eat and how, et cetera.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:31:33):**  Like it's really obviously focused on the masks and washing your hands and all this  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:31:38):**  measures to not get this virus or others, but it's hardly, but it's obviously the mainstream  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:31:44):**  or the TV news you follow.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:31:47):**  It's hardly ever about the food we eat or what else can you do to make sure you're less  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:31:52):**  vulnerable or how sick actually are we all or what's the big discussion on healthcare,  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:31:57):**  which I think we are all having in our bubbles, but I'm very happy to hear that in the retail  
**[0:32:01-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:01):**  bubbles, et cetera, that discussion is also happening because it's such a crucial one.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:05):**  I think it's fair to say, I mean, there are probably 10 retailers that before COVID you  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:08):**  would probably never say that they had a grand vision around this, but they're talking about  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:13):**  it now and Hey, they're probably talking about it because their customers are talking about  
**[0:32:16-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:16):**  it, but nonetheless they're talking about it.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:18):**  Which is amazing.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:19):**  Yeah, it's amazing.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:20):**  And what's great about these companies is they have the scale to bring better food to  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:23):**  people faster.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:24):**  So yeah, I think it's a win for the entire food system.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:28):**  No, and I've seen, I mean, I've seen the numbers of many, I mean, direct to consumer brands,  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:33):**  but also farmers.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:34):**  I mean, they've all gone through the roof, especially at the beginning, obviously when  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:38):**  everybody was scrambling to get access to food and suddenly we were thinking, who do  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:41):**  we know who has eggs or vegetables, et cetera?  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:44):**  Where can I buy something?  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:45):**  But many of those customers stayed in, not all, not the 300% growth that many had in  
**[0:32:49-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:49):**  a few months, but many stayed for price, for quality, for convenience, for taste, for whatever,  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:32:56):**  for the connection and in the local food market, it has been a huge shift as well.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:01):**  Let's see how many have done numbers that they didn't expect for the next three, four  
**[0:33:04-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:04):**  years.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:05):**  So we're probably in a place where we thought to be in five years or so in many places of  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:10):**  the market.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:11):**  And of course it's been an enormous hit for many other places of the market, like the  
**[0:33:14-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:14):**  restaurants and hotels.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:16):**  And if you've been selling to them, you are and were probably in deep trouble.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:21):**  Just devastating.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:22):**  That's right.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:23):**  Many won't open again, but we'll see in the next years if this has been a general good  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:28):**  thing or at least happy accident within a huge pandemic and a huge suffering, but at  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:32):**  least a focus on food and health.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:34):**  I'm happy to hear that the big retailers are starting to pay attention a bit faster than  
**[0:33:38-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:38):**  we thought they would.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:39):**  Yeah, me too.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:40):**  No, that's knock on wood that that continues.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:43):**  Now that's true.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:44):**  But at least a lot more people, at least in lockdown, if you were in lockdown, started  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:47):**  cooking again and started looking at different things and probably paying a bit more attention  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:52):**  to food, which helped a lot of awareness to grow.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:33:56):**  To ask another question I didn't ask last time for sure, because I think I introduced  
**[0:34:00-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:00):**  it relatively recently, but I'm very curious about your answer.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:03):**  What if you would be in charge of a one billion dollar investment portfolio tomorrow morning  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:08):**  or this morning even?  
**[0:34:09-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:09):**  We're recording this on Friday, so you can actually have the weekend to think about it.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:12):**  Let's say Monday morning, you're in charge, you wake up and you're in charge of quite  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:15):**  a large investment portfolio.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:17):**  I'm saying a billion not because I think it's a perfect number, but I see a lot of interest  
**[0:34:23-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:23):**  into the space coming from larger investors.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:25):**  And I think the sector as a whole, we need to start thinking about larger numbers, not  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:30):**  because investment is perfect, not because we we all need to raise a lot of money, but  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:34):**  because there's going to be pressure on the sector and to reach the impact we want to  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:39):**  have.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:40):**  We need to be comfortable with a lot of zeros.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:42):**  So what if you would be in charge of an investment portfolio like that on next Monday?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:46):**  What would you focus on and how would you put that to work?  
**[0:34:49-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:49):**  Well first of all, I question the decision of anyone who put me in charge of that.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:52):**  But let's say nonetheless, I ended up with it.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:56):**  It's interesting because a couple of years ago, a few of us just got together who are  
**[0:34:59-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:34:59):**  super passionate about food system change.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:01):**  And we said, you know what, just for as a fun design exercise, let's build what we think  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:05):**  would be sort of the utopian food system.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:07):**  Hey, if we could start from scratch and just say, hey, how would this thing work from the  
**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:11):**  beginning to the end?  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:13):**  And that conversation broke down so quickly because we understood right away that there  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:17):**  were so many biases that each one of us had.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:19):**  It was so complex and it was just so confusing to kind of get around social norms and cultural  
**[0:35:24-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:24):**  beliefs and just the complexities of how food is delivered from one place to another that  
**[0:35:29-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:29):**  we said, you know what, it's impossible to do here on Earth.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:32):**  So let's do it as if you were traveling to space and needed to build a closed loop food  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:37):**  system for Mars.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:39):**  And none of us have any aspirations of being astronauts or going to another planet.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:42):**  But it became so hard to do here that we said, OK, let's just move to another planet and  
**[0:35:47-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:47):**  do it.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:48):**  And we were able to kind of say, OK, hey, at least academically, here's all the things  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:51):**  that would be needed to sort of deliver optimal nutrition, safety, resource utilization and  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:35:56):**  pleasure to a specific population.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:00):**  So if I had a billion dollars, I guess this is shooting from the hip here, I would probably  
**[0:36:04-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:04):**  take a million dollars of that and I would try to stitch together here real solutions  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:11):**  that already exist in places around the world of what's working from inputs to the farm,  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:17):**  to the supply chain, to how food is being delivered, how workers are being treated,  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:22):**  how people are actually getting the nutrition that they actually need or actually want while  
**[0:36:26-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:26):**  food is still enjoyable.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:27):**  And when you say stitch together, what do you mean by that?  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:29):**  I just mean trying to build like a we talked about earlier, sort of one of the issues in  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:34):**  terms of how solvable is this problem is that we're all operating in silence.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:38):**  And if we had more time on the podcast, I would say, hey, a lot of that is attributed  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:41):**  to the investment model and how we actually fund some of these innovations.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:45):**  We have time.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:46):**  This is not a strict format.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:47):**  So why is that the investment model like at the base of some of these issues?  
**[0:36:51-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:51):**  Now I'm going to dig, of course.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:52):**  I think the investment model that we rely on today for food system change was built  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:36:58):**  for another era and another industry, the tech industry.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:02):**  I think it's built for software and hardware.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:04):**  Of course, there's some software and hardware solutions in food, but it's meant very much  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:09):**  to say, hey, you get a little bit of money, you show a little bit of traction, you get  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:13):**  a little bit more money, you show a little bit more traction, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:16):**  And sometimes it works and sometimes you stop at one of those points.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:20):**  The challenge with doing that in food is kind of what we've been talking about now for the  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:23):**  last 30 or 40 minutes is that that creates silos.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:27):**  So if I'm investing in a company that's trying to increase yields, then there's a whole ecosystem  
**[0:37:34-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:34):**  of companies that are focused on yield expansion.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:37):**  And there's another silo around shipment and there's another silo around tracking and tracing  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:42):**  and et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:43):**  But there are a few exceptions, of course.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:45):**  Things are changing, but in general, they're not.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:47):**  There are no investment models that say, hey, I need to put all these things together.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:52):**  So I'm not going to invest in this little company and this little company that I'm going  
**[0:37:55-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:55):**  to make them compete for investment dollars.  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:57):**  I'm going to make them compete for talent.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:37:58):**  I'm going to make them compete for the same customers and may the strongest survive.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:02):**  Great.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:03):**  And 10 years from now, we'll find out who really is the best at improving yields, but  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:07):**  we don't have 10 years.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:08):**  So I would take a million dollars of that billion dollar fund and I would try to stitch  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:11):**  together some of those most promising solutions into a single solution.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:16):**  And it may be hypothetical and it may be only in pilot form, but if I can get 10 things  
**[0:38:21-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:21):**  to work together or at least identify what is needed for them to work together, then  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:25):**  I think the other 999 million dollars of that could be used to then scale that solution.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:30):**  But to put a billion dollars and invest it in a hundred different places and hope that  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:34):**  at the end of the day, three or four of those solutions or companies survive, that's just  
**[0:38:39-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:39):**  a broken model in my mind and it's not going to solve any of the major problems that we're  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:42):**  facing.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:43):**  So you would really try to apply a portfolio approach, but with a much longer horizon or  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:49):**  at least not the usual competing within the portfolio or competing with outside the portfolio.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:53):**  Do you have an example of that, how to make that that you stitch together 10 solutions?  
**[0:38:59-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:38:59):**  What could that be?  
**[0:39:00-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:00):**  Well, again, we couldn't come up with that before.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:03):**  So we came up with it like, hey, this is what you would do if you landed on a foreign planet  
**[0:39:07-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:07):**  that had hostile environment and limited resources and you needed to keep a population happy  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:12):**  and alive and safe for a prolonged period of time.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:17):**  And we had to do that again in sort of this simulated environment.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:20):**  So I don't have good examples of that, but that's what I would do with the first million  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:24):**  dollars is find those examples.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:25):**  I mean, I know there are thousands of companies out there in each one of these little silos  
**[0:39:29-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:29):**  that are doing great things, but today they don't find one another.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:32):**  They can't, they don't have the time to look up and say, okay, well I'm going to go and  
**[0:39:36-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:36):**  connect my work with someone else.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:38):**  That's just not the reality of the food system we live in today.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:40):**  You're either focused on your existing problems or trying to make that existing solution work.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:46):**  Maybe you have a nice conversation at conferences and when we were used to be able to go to  
**[0:39:49-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:49):**  conferences, but that's it.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:51):**  That's it.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:52):**  Then you walk away and you're like, okay, I'm back in survival mode.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:54):**  Now I got to go raise money or I got to go hire someone or get this customer deal or  
**[0:39:58-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:58):**  survive.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:39:59):**  And it's really tough.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:00):**  And I understand that's the nature of business, but we're talking about major problems here  
**[0:40:04-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:04):**  that are affecting humanity and threatening our planet.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:07):**  And so it requires a different approach and a different investor or a different investment  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:11):**  approach as well.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:12):**  That's right.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:13):**  And it's food.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:14):**  So there's always going to be a market.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:15):**  There's always going to be a return on that investment.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:17):**  Hey, the better you can connect all these dots and make it work more efficiently, there's  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:20):**  always going to be a return on that investment because people need to eat.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:24):**  So it's not a risky investment.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:25):**  It's just a complicated process and it's a complicated investment and we're not good  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:29):**  at complicated.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:30):**  No, that's definitely true.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:31):**  That's why no one gives me a billion dollars, by the way.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:35):**  Maybe after they listen to this, they think, ah, but actually, right.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:37):**  I mean, for me, one of the interesting parts is the amount of money that tries to get into  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:43):**  the space using the old model and in many cases using the software model, especially  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:47):**  on timing and horizon and indeed the competition.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:50):**  And it's going to be challenging.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:52):**  But what I'm seeing most is that the amount of money that tries to enter the space is  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:56):**  growing exponentially.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:40:58):**  The amount of investable and obviously that depends on the model you're using as an investor.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:02):**  The amount of investable companies or projects or et cetera is definitely not there.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:06):**  So there's going to be a lot of competition.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:08):**  Hopefully, let's say the company's on the ground.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:10):**  I don't know if you can affirm to that, can at least they can pick the investor or they  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:14):**  have a bit of choice or hopefully in the next year to have a bit of choice of what money  
**[0:41:18-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:18):**  they take on, what kind of money and what kind of conditions comes with that and not  
**[0:41:22-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:22):**  having to always go for the fund or if you see fund that needs to exit in a relatively  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:27):**  short period and meaning putting a lot of stress on the company.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:30):**  So I'm hoping that that competition helps at least for the companies to pick the right  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:35):**  type of growth capital or the right type of capital to basically be appropriate for them.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:39):**  I hope so.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:40):**  And before you press record today, I know we were talking about some others that are  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:44):**  out there and they have different investment thesis.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:46):**  And so, yeah, change is happening.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:48):**  I just it needs to happen with a sense of urgency and at the pace that the problems  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:53):**  are growing.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:54):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:55):**  And that's not happening yet.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:41:56):**  There's definitely hope and there are signs of change, but as always, change is slow.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:42:00):**  If you would like to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and

**[0:42:20-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:42:20):**  Like what kind of questions to ask.

**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:42:28):**  And what do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't believe to be  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:42:32):**  true?  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:42:33):**  I was actually inspired by by John Kempf, who asked this question usually about traditional  
**[0:42:37-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:42:37):**  agriculture and who, by the way, shared our previous interview in his newsletter and made  
**[0:42:42-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:42:42):**  it explode, basically.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:42:43):**  So suddenly there was a huge uptake around Christmas, I think last year, and we didn't  
**[0:42:47-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:42:47):**  understand where it came from until I saw the newsletter of John.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:42:50):**  So if you're listening, John, thank you for that.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:42:52):**  But the question, what do you believe to be true about region ag or region agriculture  
**[0:42:55-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:42:55):**  practices that others don't believe to be true?  
**[0:42:57-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:42:57):**  Oh, boy, I would never claim to know anything that I would think that other people don't  
**[0:43:01-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:43:01):**  know, considering the level of passion.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:43:04):**  Where do you have another opinion or where do you have another angle to it?  
**[0:43:07-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:43:07):**  Here's what I believe is true and has to happen for regenerative agriculture to become truly  
**[0:43:14-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:43:14):**  mainstream and have the impact that we all hope it has.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:43:16):**  I think as individuals, as consumers, I have to be able to say, hey, how does this directly  
**[0:43:22-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:43:22):**  affect me and my family, not just the long horizon of planetary and human health?  
**[0:43:28-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:43:28):**  So what does this mean for me today and what can I do differently as a result of something  
**[0:43:33-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:43:33):**  that you're doing that has a positive effect on my life?  
**[0:43:36-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:43:36):**  And it's obvious and yet it's not obvious because we're still not directly answering  
**[0:43:41-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:43:41):**  that or we're still not able to directly answer that question.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:43:44):**  So I don't know if that's a dancing around what you asked me, but I think that has to  
**[0:43:48-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:43:48):**  be the driver of all the decisions, investments, innovations, all the work we put into regenerative  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:43:54):**  agriculture has to be around an individual being able to answer that question confidently.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:43:59):**  It has to be better for me and my family, basically.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:02):**  Which comes back to the nutrient discussion we obviously had in the last 47 minutes and  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:07):**  the key questions around measuring that, which I think it's a very fair answer.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:13):**  Not dancing around it at all.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:14):**  Yeah, there's so many important elements of food, but at the end of the day, fundamentally  
**[0:44:18-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:18):**  we're eating to stay alive and survive.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:21):**  And so it has to come down to that the basic questions have to be answered.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:25):**  Hey, is this good for me or not?  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:26):**  Now, beyond that, we all have different values and we can apply those values and there's  
**[0:44:30-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:30):**  lots of other important things, but today we cannot answer the most fundamental question  
**[0:44:34-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:34):**  about a piece of food in our hand.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:37):**  And that is what's inside of it.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:39):**  So I think we have to be able to do that first.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:41):**  Which is so extremely shocking, even after two interviews with you.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:45):**  I want to thank you so much.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:46):**  Be conscious of your time.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:48):**  And thank you so much for this check in, as always, extremely interesting.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:52):**  And you've been up to a lot in a year.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:44:54):**  And I hope to be checking in with you again to see what has been happening in your nutrient  
**[0:45:00-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:45:00):**  density world.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:45:01):**  Well, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to talk about what we're doing.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:45:03):**  So thank you so much.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:45:04):**  And we'd be happy to come back whenever you would have us.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:45:07):**  Thank you.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/11/10/greg-schewmaker-2#t=0:45:08):**  Thank you so much, Greg.

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:00):**  You're listening to the summary of the interview. For a link to the full-length episode, please check the description below.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:08):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture â€“ Investing as if the Planet Mattered,  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:13):**  a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:18):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:24):**  while making an appropriate and fair return. Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:30):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat our land,  
**[0:00:34-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:34):**  grow our food and what we eat. And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers,  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:40):**  start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:46):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I will definitely  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:50):**  continue to do so and release about an episode a month. But at the same time, I would love to take  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:55):**  this further. Share more interviews, there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:00):**  food and agriculture. More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:06):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:11):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means,  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:15):**  I invite you to support me and make this happen. For more information, please find the link to my

**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:31):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture. Today I'm joined  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:35):**  by Brian von Herzen, Executive Director of the Climate Foundation and the original founder of  
**[0:01:40-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:40):**  the Marine Permaculture Movement. We realized even in the early 2000s that we had to do something  
**[0:01:46-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:46):**  sustainable to try to address this exponential increase in melting. And that led me to do a  
**[0:01:53-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:53):**  sabbatical in Woods Hole in studying algae biology and carbon biogeochemistry. And then beyond that,  
**[0:02:02-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:02):**  to really consider how can we enlist life to help us rebalance carbon in our seas and our soils.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:10):**  Why is that connection between the mountains and the sea so important?  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:14):**  The mountains help the sea and the sea helps the mountains, or I should say the soils.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:20):**  So I just finished giving a talk here in Morocco where I was visiting with the government and we  
**[0:02:26-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:26):**  met with some of the agriculture and some of the agriculture groups here and agencies. And it was  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:34):**  very interesting because I spoke about my home state of California and I was really interested  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:39):**  in the fact that we were able to do this research. And I spoke about my home state of California,  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:43):**  where we've studied the kelp forests and you know, there's a shifting baseline. No one has a living  
**[0:02:48-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:48):**  memory of the kelp forests that were off the coast of California in the mid 1800s. But we went back  
**[0:02:56-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:56):**  and did the research to find the original U.S. geodetic survey maps from 1850s, 1860s, 1880s,  
**[0:03:05-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:05):**  a kilometer wide extending from Point Concepcion, hundreds of kilometers all the way past the border  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:12):**  with Mexico. And this was a continuous river of kelp between 10 and 25 meters depth that was  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:18):**  covering the coastline. And it was this incredible bounty of nature. Now, what happened was in the  
**[0:03:24-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:24):**  early 1900s, we had a development of farming, urbanization, but primarily the loss of soil  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:32):**  and runoff that went into the sea because of standard farming practices and that was  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:36):**  exacerbated later. And between the silt and the nutrients, the visibility in the water dropped  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:42):**  precipitously. And this actually choked off the juvenile kelp from growing from the depth of 25  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:48):**  meters to the surface. If they don't have enough sunlight, they can't grow all the way to the  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:52):**  surface. If they can't grow, they don't survive. And so we lost the deep kelps and we lost some of  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:56):**  the middle kelps. And so now we only have a small remnant of the forest that once was. And so this  
**[0:04:02-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:02):**  is how our farming practices can affect the sea and the sea clarity. And so if we do less runoff  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:10):**  and more regenerative farming, we can actually have a much clearer ocean. And then conversely,  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:15):**  the seaweeds have this incredible input, a catalytic input almost, on the growth of crops,  
**[0:04:21-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:21):**  both as a soil amendment and also as a seaweed foliar biostimulant. And in several other ways,  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:28):**  for example, as a feed supplement for ruminant livestock, we can cut most of the methane of the  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:34):**  enteric emissions of ruminant livestock. So there's so many ways that the sea gives back to the farm  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:39):**  and gives back to the soil. And I think it's a full circle, a circular value chain, if you will.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:44):**  What we're noticing is that seaweed does a fantastic job of increasing the stress resistance  
**[0:04:49-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:49):**  of the plants. And that includes resistance to heat, resistance to drought, and resistance to  
**[0:04:57-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:57):**  disease. And all crops have some amount of stress, but when we get into a global warming situation,  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:05):**  the amount of heat stress and the amount of drought becomes severe. And the seaweed  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:11):**  has been able to confer stress resistance to these crops very substantially.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:17):**  I think seaweed as a nutraceutical has been absolutely amazing. I just finished meeting with  
**[0:05:24-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:24):**  some researchers in Europe that have studied the effects of seaweed for many diseases. One study I  
**[0:05:35-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:35):**  saw in the US that was about Asia showed, of course, on a countrywide basis, about seven times  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:43):**  less breast cancer in countries like Thailand and Japan. And furthermore, in a mouse model for breast  
**[0:05:48-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:48):**  cancer, they observed 10 to 20 times lower tumor incidence in breast cancer when a small amount of  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:56):**  seaweed was added to the water supply of these mice. And that was very substantial because all  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:03):**  the other diets were identical. And so they were able to reproduce this cancer effectiveness with  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:10):**  the seaweed. And as the oceans warm, 93% of global warming is going into the oceans, we create this  
**[0:06:17-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:17):**  stratified layer of water, and that forms a barrier to the upwelling that provides nutrients to algae.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:25):**  And so the normal amount of offshore winds would normally bring the water up to the surface and  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:35):**  cause the overturning circulation and enable the seaweed to grow. And that gets shut down  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:42):**  when the ocean gets too warm. We look to the tropics to use marine solar energy, also waves  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:48):**  in the ocean, and even wind energy in the higher latitudes to restore overturning circulation.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:54):**  We have pipes that come up from below the thermocline. We can provide up to a million  
**[0:06:58-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:58):**  cubic meters of seawater per day to a larger seaweed permaculture and effectively enable  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:06):**  the irrigation 12 months a year of seaweed forest and enable it to grow at least as much as it did  
**[0:07:12-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:12):**  under natural conditions. Yes, marine permaculture irrigation is a new product for an existing market.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:20):**  It's over a $10 billion industry already in Asia, and we see huge opportunities to  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:25):**  develop these technologies further for regions of Europe, including the Mediterranean,  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:31):**  including the tropical Atlantic and tropical and subtropical Pacific Oceans.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:38):**  Well, I think there's a key opportunity and that is developing new products for existing industries,  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:43):**  and that's one reason we've been doing a lot of work on irrigation and seaweed farms. But beyond  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:48):**  that, we're looking at a $350 billion agricultural input market, a $600 billion  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:55):**  nutraceutical market, and an $800 billion cosmetics market. And seaweed has a central  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:01):**  role to play in all of those. We find time and again, we're supply limited as to how much kelp,  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:07):**  how much red seaweed we can actually produce. There's a global shortage of Kappa Phi Kappa seaweed,  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:12):**  for example, and the prices have doubled over the last year or two. What do you see as the biggest risk?  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:20):**  Well, in the Americas today, and perhaps in Europe as well, there are some regions near shore that  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:25):**  occasionally have harmful algal blooms. And if there were harmful algal blooms already occurring,  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:31):**  then marine permaculture upwelling operation could potentially exacerbate those. So we need to  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:36):**  monitor for the presence or growth of harmful algal blooms upstream, and then monitor downstream  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:43):**  as well. And if there's a situation where there's an exacerbation or some problem is getting worse,  
**[0:08:49-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:49):**  then the marine permaculture can be turned off. And then that would remove the increase of harmful  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:56):**  algal bloom. So we see this as a big opportunity and the fact that seaweed as an organic feed  
**[0:09:02-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:02):**  supplement at a level of one to 10% of the feed is able to eliminate most of the enteric emissions  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:11):**  of ruminant livestock is extremely significant. Just listen to the summary of the interview.

**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:00:27):**  million euros for a community-based agriculture project in Germany to secure their land.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:00:32):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:00:33):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:39-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:00:39):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:00:40):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:00:45):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:00:50):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:00:55):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:00:57):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:01-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:01:01):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:01:03):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:01:08):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:01:13):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:01:17):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:01:21):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:01:24):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:01:29):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:01:34):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:01:50):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:01:53):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:01:54):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:01:58):**  I'm Koon Vossien, your host.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:00):**  Today I'm talking to Thomas Rippel, a biodynamic farmer passionate about combining his knowledge  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:04):**  on agriculture, sustainable business and community building to reconnect city people to farming  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:09):**  again.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:10):**  We have much to cover, so let's get started.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:12):**  Welcome Thomas.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:13):**  Yeah, hi.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:14):**  Thanks for inviting me to your podcast.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:16):**  I'm really excited to be here.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:18):**  I've listened to quite a few of your podcasts and you've really had some of the most fantastic  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:24):**  people working in regenerative agriculture in the investing space on here.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:29):**  So I'm really honored to be a part of it.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:30):**  Thank you so much for making the time this morning.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:33):**  And I want to start with the usual question that I always do.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:36):**  Why are you in this space and why are you building soil and doing what you're doing?  
**[0:02:40-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:40):**  Well, I think as with most people that you've interviewed, it's a very personal story.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:49):**  My background is not in farming.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:50):**  I didn't grow up on the farm.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:53):**  I originally studied international business and Chinese.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:02:56):**  I lived in China for three years and it was during that time that I became disillusioned  
**[0:03:05-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:03:05):**  with my degree and I was looking for maybe a deeper meaning of or a perspective of where  
**[0:03:16-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:03:16):**  I'm actually going.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:03:18):**  And so I had this kind of crisis and I was not sure really which direction I'm going  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:03:30):**  with my degree and where that's going to lead.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:03:33):**  And so I decided to take a time out and through friends of the family, I was able to spend  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:03:43):**  that time out on an organic farm in Switzerland.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:03:48):**  And so I completely disconnected.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:03:51):**  Not a bad place to be.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:03:52):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:03:53):**  Yeah, it was really a transformative experience for me.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:03:56):**  I really dived in.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:03:58):**  I disconnected from everything, turned off my phone and disconnected from the Internet.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:04:04):**  And I was just working on that farm every day and working with the soil and planting  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:04:12):**  and growing and harvesting.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:04:16):**  It was a new experience for me and it was a really beautiful experience.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:04:21):**  And so I decided I want to work in farming.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:04:25):**  And so that was my start about seven years ago or eight years ago now.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:04:32):**  And since then, that's what I've been doing.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:04:36):**  And after a couple of years working on several projects, I co-initiated several agricultural  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:04:48):**  projects.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:04:49):**  One of them was a new funded project.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:04:52):**  I realized that what I'm longing for is actually to work in farming with my own hands and not  
**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:04:58):**  to kind of do agricultural projects on a management level.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:05:05):**  And so I decided to do a vocational training in Switzerland to become a farmer.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:05:14):**  And in Switzerland, they take this actually quite seriously.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:05:18):**  Vocational training to become a farmer usually takes at least three years.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:05:23):**  I did the biodynamic education, which actually goes for four and a half years full time working  
**[0:05:31-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:05:31):**  on different farms.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:05:34):**  And the way vocational trainings are set up is that 80% of the time you work on the job  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:05:40):**  and 20% of the time you go to school.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:05:44):**  And so for me, it was three weeks per month working on the farm and one week per month  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:05:52):**  going to school.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:05:54):**  And it was in that education that I was kind of envisioning that at some point in the future  
**[0:06:05-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:06:05):**  I will have my own farm where I will have some cows and grow vegetables and grains and  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:06:14):**  also have kind of agro-tourism.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:06:16):**  I had this whole vision for this beautiful farm in my head.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:06:20):**  And then when I actually started looking into buying a farm, looking for a farm that I could  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:06:28):**  buy, it dawned on me that I'm not going to be able to afford that.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:06:34):**  It's really expensive to buy a farm.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:06:38):**  And if you want to fund that through external loans from a bank and you have to pay market  
**[0:06:45-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:06:45):**  interest rates, there's no way you can earn that kind of money from agriculture.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:06:52):**  And you were looking in one of the most expensive real estate economies in the world, obviously.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:06:58):**  But this is a problem that I've heard many times on this podcast.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:07:01):**  So it seems to be a problem or a huge challenge for people that want to get into farming around  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:07:06):**  the world.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:07:07):**  Yeah, I think this is a problem, not just in Switzerland.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:07:10):**  I know it's a problem in Germany.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:07:12):**  I know it's a problem in the US.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:07:14):**  I'm less familiar with other countries, but I'm sure that this is a huge barrier.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:07:23):**  And part of the reason is that a lot of speculative cash has moved into buying agricultural land  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:07:35):**  and thus driving up the price of land.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:07:39):**  And we have seen in the past 10, 20 years a real decoupling of the actual productive  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:07:45):**  value of the land from the market price.  
**[0:07:50-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:07:50):**  So as a farmer, to buy land and usually you finance any purchase like that through an  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:08:00):**  external loan.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:08:01):**  So if you would want to buy land, then you just grow crops normally and you would want  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:08:07):**  to pay the interest on the loan.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:08:09):**  The math just doesn't add up.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:08:12):**  So right now, most of the land purchases happening in Europe are being done by financial institutions  
**[0:08:18-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:08:18):**  who are speculatively buying land and farmers are now only able to afford to lease land.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:08:26):**  So buying land is really out of the question for most farmers.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:08:29):**  And so this is really an unhealthy development.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:08:34):**  Why is it unhealthy?  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:08:35):**  I mean, I can imagine but it's great to hear from somebody that's in that space.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:08:38):**  Why is it not good for a bank to buy some land and lease it for instance, to you as  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:08:43):**  a young sustainable farming farmer?  
**[0:08:47-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:08:47):**  Well, these asset managers, or these funds, they only have one criteria and that is the  
**[0:08:56-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:08:56):**  financial and so they are looking to maximize their profits.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:09:04):**  And so they're leasing out the lands to whoever pays the highest lease.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:09:09):**  And right now, because the externalities of production are simply not taken into consideration,  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:09:18):**  right now, the person or the farmer or the company that farms in the least sustainable  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:09:24):**  way is able to pay the highest lease because they're exploiting the soil.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:09:30):**  And specifically here in the region where I'm at, it's actually asparagus farmers that  
**[0:09:38-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:09:38):**  are really intensively working the soil and using excessive amounts of fertilizers.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:09:46):**  They're able to pay the highest lease and that is the least healthy use of the land.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:09:54):**  Whereas an organic farmer that has a healthy crop rotation, he's a good steward of the  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:10:02):**  land but he's not able to pay the highest lease.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:10:05):**  So obviously, the asparagus farmer gets the land for lease.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:10:12):**  And so this question of ownership and according to what criteria the land is leased out really  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:10:19):**  determines the kind of farming that we're seeing.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:10:21):**  And it's one of the big, big drivers behind the industrialization of agriculture.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:10:26):**  And so when you notice that and experience it because you just simply couldn't afford  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:10:31):**  the land you wanted, maybe you could afford some piece extremely far away or extremely  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:10:35):**  uncomfortable as a piece of land, but the piece of land where you could farm sustainably  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:10:41):**  and profitably just wasn't there.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:10:43):**  What was your next step?  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:10:45):**  What led to what you're doing now in your exciting project?  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:10:50):**  Right.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:10:51):**  So at first it was frustrating.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:10:54):**  It took me a year to kind of digest that, that I'm not going to be able to afford a  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:11:00):**  farm.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:11:01):**  How many pieces of land did you see or how many times did you try and did you do that  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:11:04):**  calculation?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:11:05):**  Just out of curiosity.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:11:06):**  I don't want to open that wound again.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:11:09):**  I specifically looked at three different farms and I mean really concretely really looking  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:11:16):**  at what's possible there.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:11:19):**  But I kept my eyes open and read about many, many different opportunities where it was  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:11:25):**  clear from the beginning that's not an option.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:11:28):**  Then it was through a friend of mine that my eyes were opened to other possibilities  
**[0:11:35-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:11:35):**  and that being community supported agriculture where you don't necessarily need to yourself  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:11:44):**  buy land and run this farm.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:11:47):**  But as a group together you can do it.  
**[0:11:51-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:11:51):**  And my friend, he started a community supported farm in Germany six years ago which is now  
**[0:12:00-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:12:00):**  a community of 12 to 15 people about my age between 25 and 35 running this farm.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:12:07):**  And at first they were actually leasing the land and then two years into their project  
**[0:12:16-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:12:16):**  starting this community supported agriculture the owner of the farm died and the heirs they  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:12:24):**  didn't want to continue leasing the farm out.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:12:27):**  They just went to sell it to the highest bidder.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:12:31):**  And the people who were here including my friends they couldn't afford it.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:12:36):**  They wouldn't have been able to afford this.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:12:39):**  So it was really through coincidence and the initiative of the people here that a cooperative  
**[0:12:49-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:12:49):**  was founded that would buy the land a nonprofit cooperative and a very wealthy generous person  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:13:04):**  funded the purchase of the land here through a loan and said OK well we'll secure the land  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:13:12):**  in this cooperative and I fund it.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:13:16):**  But long term you guys will need to get other people involved and invested so that land  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:13:24):**  is funded.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:13:25):**  So a kind of community ownership.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:13:28):**  And yes so my friend then he knew that I was looking for a farm for a place to be and he  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:13:40):**  asked me if I want to join them.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:13:42):**  And first I was hesitant because I've been in Switzerland for a very long time and I  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:13:48):**  wasn't really looking at Germany.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:13:52):**  You know it's a different country.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:13:54):**  But I came here and I really fell in love with the people here the community just so  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:14:01):**  vibrant and so full of energy and such a good spirit.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:14:07):**  So I took a chance not that I had so many other options for farms and I came here and  
**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:14:15):**  then.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:14:16):**  Yes what they were hoping what my friend was hoping is that I could help them to do some  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:14:25):**  fundraising for the farm.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:14:26):**  So some fundraising because the wealthy person that made the loan wasn't enough to complete  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:14:35):**  the farm you needed other types of funding to get it up and running.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:14:39):**  I'm speculating.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:14:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:14:41):**  So let me explain that.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:14:45):**  That wealthy person she funded the whole farm but she didn't she didn't want to do that  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:14:51):**  in perpetuity.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:14:52):**  It was an interest free loan really just so that this project can continue.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:14:58):**  So the land wasn't sold to the highest bidder and people would grow asparagus or whatever  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:15:03):**  the best lease price would be.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:15:05):**  Absolutely and this hope this wonderful project here this community supported farm woods would  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:15:10):**  have disappeared.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:15:12):**  But that person that gave that loan made it very clear that it's only for a certain period  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:15:19):**  of time which was 10 years she said she's happy to put that money in for 10 years which  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:15:23):**  was it was eight hundred eighty thousand euros.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:15:27):**  It's not a small sum and you know without interest.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:15:31):**  So it's very very generous but not in perpetuity.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:15:34):**  The idea was that the cooperative that now own the land should find investors shareholders  
**[0:15:41-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:15:41):**  people who want to become part of this community of this farm and the people running this farm  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:15:49):**  they obviously they're not professional fundraisers and you know they're running the farm and  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:15:55):**  that's a lot of work it's a 12 hour day job.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:15:59):**  So after three years they they managed to find a few investors but really not much.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:16:10):**  And so the idea was my idea coming in here was that we run a crowd investing campaign  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:16:17):**  and do like a very big publicity campaign.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:16:21):**  And so I looked into that looked at providers of crowd funding or crowd investing platforms  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:16:30):**  and they were asking for very high commissions seven to ten percent.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:16:35):**  Yeah I know.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:16:36):**  Right so if you're raising you know we're looking at raising eight hundred eighty thousand  
**[0:16:40-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:16:40):**  euros here and if they are asking for seven to ten percent then that's a commission of  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:16:47):**  something like seventy thousand eighty thousand euros.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:16:51):**  It's a good business model for the platform.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:16:53):**  It's a good business model and I think for maybe some other campaigns you know that's  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:16:59):**  fair enough to ask those kinds of commissions but for a farm that's really not feasible  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:17:05):**  to pay that kind of commission.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:17:07):**  No the margins aren't there.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:17:08):**  It's yeah it's really not there even you know even if you work really hard you can't you  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:17:13):**  can't afford that.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:17:15):**  So we decided OK instead of paying eighty thousand in commission we'll we'll put up  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:17:21):**  some money and actually I went to a nonprofit foundation.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:17:24):**  I told them I want to run this crowd investing campaign and we want to set up our own platform  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:17:32):**  and we need some initial funding whether they would be willing to support that and we got  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:17:37):**  a very generous donation of thirty thousand euros to fund this campaign and with that  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:17:43):**  money we set up our own crowd investing platform.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:17:47):**  Me and a colleague of mine who is a programmer and I hired some awesome people who made a  
**[0:17:53-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:17:53):**  very cool video and we organized a whole bunch of events and it was a half year preparation  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:18:03):**  time and then we ran the campaign you know as usual thirty day crowd funding campaign  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:18:09):**  and we exceeded really all expectations and raised more than one million euros.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:18:15):**  Wow and just to dive into that a bit I mean of course there's this I see the crowd investing  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:18:21):**  world exploding but I didn't see it happening yet on a farm level or let alone on the regenerative  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:18:28):**  agriculture level.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:18:29):**  What kind of investment is this?  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:18:31):**  What am I as a crowd investor in this farm?  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:18:35):**  What am I getting or buying or what would be my role in the future?  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:18:39):**  Right so this is I think what will maybe shock some people.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:18:44):**  So the investment is a share in the cooperative that owns the land.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:18:49):**  This cooperative was started three years ago when this farm was in a situation where the  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:18:54):**  farm was being sold and by now this cooperative has also bought land for other farms that  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:19:00):**  are in a similar situation.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:19:03):**  So the whole purpose of this cooperative is to buy land and keep it in a stewardship role  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:19:09):**  and lease it out to the farmers long term and to charge very very low leases to the  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:19:16):**  farmers so that regenerative agriculture can be practiced.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:19:23):**  And as an investor you buy shares in the cooperative and the shares they give no dividends and  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:19:32):**  there's no other financial reward.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:19:34):**  So basically the money that you put in is the money that you get out at some point.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:19:43):**  But actually you invest in you pay a 5% management fee.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:19:48):**  So let's say you invest 10,000 euros you actually only get back 9,500 with no interest and you  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:19:56):**  can only take the money out after five years.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:19:59):**  And if you want to take out your money you have a period of notice of usually one year.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:20:06):**  So let's say not ideal investing terms if you're looking for the highest return.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:20:11):**  Right super unattractive.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:20:13):**  And yet you raised over a million.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:20:14):**  Right.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:20:15):**  So we saw that people are really willing to invest in something if they feel like it has  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:20:23):**  an impact in that you know we this farm has existed for six years so really they have  
**[0:20:29-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:20:29):**  a track record and people can see what's going on and that this small farm which is 30 hectares  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:20:38):**  about 100 acres that usually does not provide enough income in conventional agriculture  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:20:44):**  terms that would not provide enough income for one family to live on.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:20:48):**  This farm because it's so diverse produces 100 different kinds of vegetables has 16 milk  
**[0:20:54-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:20:54):**  cows produces its own cheese 20 different kinds of cheese produces grains produces honey  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:02):**  and raised pigs.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:05):**  So the diversity of it provides an income living for five families.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:12):**  So you're saying it's more productive.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:14):**  I mean productive is a very difficult term here but it provides a living for five families  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:19):**  and in conventional chemical agriculture it wouldn't even be considered a farm because  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:24):**  one family cannot live of it.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:25):**  Yes it will only be considered a part time kind of farm.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:29):**  A hobby.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:31):**  So you would have to have an external income you know to be able to.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:36):**  Like most farmers in Europe or at least in the Netherlands where in a situation with  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:40):**  better have I mean most of the time their partner is working outside the farm just to  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:45):**  make ends meet and they have a much bigger farm usually than the 30 hectares.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:49):**  Right.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:50):**  So that's that's a really sad situation to be in that you know you're producing food  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:21:55):**  for hundreds of people really and you yourself can't make a living on that.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:22:01):**  So yeah so this community supported farm really you know normally you would sell the milk  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:22:08):**  in conventional agriculture for 30 cents a litre.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:22:11):**  And here because we make the cheese ourselves on the milk we have this enormous value creation  
**[0:22:19-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:22:19):**  where in the end our revenue of one litre of milk is about two euro seventy to three  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:22:27):**  euros per litre.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:22:29):**  So we increased the value creation tenfold through creating products directly on the  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:22:35):**  farm.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:22:36):**  Now this I think you know we tried to communicate this and show this in the video and showed  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:22:43):**  the way we treat the animals in the soil and that we're composting.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:22:47):**  This really touched a lot of people and they put their money where their heart is and invested  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:22:52):**  in this.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:22:53):**  So out of this the idea was born.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:22:56):**  To raise one million every week.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:22:59):**  Where's the limit in that?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:00):**  Right.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:01):**  So yeah where's the limit?  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:02):**  So the idea was born that we we make a better crowd investing platform and that we make  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:08):**  that open source available to the whole world that other people can kind of replicate this  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:13):**  campaign that we did here that we showed you know it's possible.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:16):**  Because there are many more of these super diverse relatively small at least idea farms  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:22):**  there are many also actually active but of course many others that have the knowledge  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:26):**  to do it but don't have the land.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:28):**  So they might be able to get this type of investment donation to actually buy land and  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:34):**  do it.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:35):**  Is that what you mean?  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:36):**  There's there's but then the question is how far how many donations or this type of very  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:41):**  unattractive investments are there to to buy the land or is there some at some point the  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:45):**  point that it actually becomes a commercial investment?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:48):**  Right so we try to figure out the numbers on that and we thought that you know maybe  
**[0:23:54-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:23:54):**  10 percent 20 percent of people are willing or I think you know a lot of people they they  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:24:05):**  they're looking for a place to put their money that they feel that it has an impact.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:24:11):**  So we thought maybe 20 percent of people in Germany are willing to take money into their  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:24:16):**  hands and invest it in something like this and maybe those people would be willing to  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:24:22):**  take 20 10 10 percent of their liquid assets.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:24:26):**  So if we kind of make this really rough calculation then there is several billion euros in capital  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:24:32):**  available that we could potentially tap into.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:24:38):**  So we thought yeah this this really does have potential and right now we're we actually  
**[0:24:45-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:24:45):**  started working on a really professional crowd investing platform specifically for regenerative  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:24:53):**  farms more specifically for community supported farms which are ideally suited for this kind  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:00):**  of crowd investing campaign because they already have a community.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:03):**  The community supported farms they're already producing for usually between 100 200 or even  
**[0:25:09-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:09):**  300 households.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:11):**  So there if they run a campaign then they already have this established network that  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:16):**  can propagate it.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:17):**  And they would run a campaign to to grow or to extend or maybe to buy the land that's  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:21):**  underneath them.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:22):**  Exactly to to really buy the land and then secure it long term because a lot of farms  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:27):**  they lease land.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:29):**  So that's that's a pretty insecure situation even though leases you know they might run  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:34):**  for 10 years.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:35):**  Yeah but still you're building soil especially if you farm in this way and you're you're  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:40):**  I'm saying between brackets you're giving it away after 10 years it's a huge value creation  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:45):**  plus you have to restart again somewhere else.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:47):**  Exactly so we think there's huge potential here and also having done the biodynamic education  
**[0:25:54-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:25:54):**  as a farmer myself I saw from my peers that 80 percent of them who invested four and a  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:26:02):**  half years of their life to learn farming 80 percent didn't find a farm you know.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:26:08):**  So we have this young generation of farmers who are willing to really dedicate their life  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:26:14):**  to sustainable farming and are you know put their whole hearts and souls into it are super  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:26:19):**  passionate about it but then end up working in some other fields because they don't have  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:26:25):**  the capital to take over farm or set up a farm.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:26:30):**  You know so that's really as a background for now what turned out to be the next bigger  
**[0:26:38-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:26:38):**  project which is running parallel to the crowd investing platform which is a blockchain land  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:26:48):**  trust framework.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:26:50):**  Yeah you do have to explain it a bit because people use blockchain everywhere but it's  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:26:56):**  often not super relevant or way too vague and in this case it's absolutely not so it  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:27:02):**  would be great to to dive into that and why that could be so important why it could be  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:27:08):**  part of a solution against the speculation and give young sustainable farmers or not  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:27:13):**  young sustainable farmers but sustainable farmers in general access to the land they  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:27:17):**  might deserve.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:27:18):**  Right so I have known many people who have dealt with blockchain the past few years either  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:27:30):**  working on startups or they have invested and so I knew a little bit about the technology  
**[0:27:36-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:27:36):**  but I was actually quite skeptical just of Bitcoin specifically knowing of not knowing  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:27:45):**  about the energy consumption that's involved with running the system I thought like that's  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:27:52):**  really not something sustainable it's not something I want to be involved with.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:27:56):**  So it was only late last year that when I was in the middle of running this crowd investing  
**[0:28:04-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:28:04):**  campaign and setting up this platform that these dots started to connect where I actually  
**[0:28:11-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:28:11):**  saw a real use case for blockchain that made sense to me and that is that we instead of  
**[0:28:22-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:28:22):**  you know issuing the shares what I explained before we were issuing shares in the cooperative  
**[0:28:25-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:28:25):**  that is a super attractive investment and quite cumbersome you know with each investor  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:28:32):**  you have to sign contracts and you have to you know really issue these shares and send  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:28:38):**  them to them and so on.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:28:40):**  And we live in 2018 so that should be there should be a better way.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:28:44):**  Right I mean we were really using kind of tools that were out of the 19th century here.  
**[0:28:53-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:28:53):**  So I thought that's why you know we're having you know these people who are investing literally  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:29:01):**  billions of dollars in cryptocurrencies.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:29:06):**  Well why don't we create a cryptocurrency and issue this cryptocurrency and then raise  
**[0:29:12-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:29:12):**  funds with that and invest that money into land and then the cryptocurrency is actually  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:29:19):**  backed in value by something real namely agricultural land.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:29:25):**  So it just so happened that in the same time frame the Swiss financial regulatory market  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:29:34):**  authority issued its guidelines dealing or issued its guidelines on how to how it's dealing  
**[0:29:41-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:29:41):**  with these new cryptocurrencies and classifying them and really giving legal security to investors.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:29:50):**  And so I thought there's a real opportunity here to really basically digitize the whole  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:29:57):**  process of issuing shares and raising funds.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:30:00):**  And what I think is really attractive here especially for cryptocurrency investors is  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:30:10):**  a lot of that there's a huge amount of volatility in the markets.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:30:13):**  Bitcoin is going up 20 percent one day and down 20 percent the next.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:30:20):**  There's fluctuations of 10 15 percent within minutes.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:30:25):**  And so this is really you can't use this as a means of payment when you know from one  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:30:31):**  minute to the next the value of this cryptocurrency varies so much.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:30:36):**  And so there have been several initiatives in the in the cryptocurrency space to create  
**[0:30:41-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:30:41):**  a stable value cryptocurrency.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:30:44):**  The most well known or the one with the highest market capitalization is Tether which is supposedly  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:30:53):**  backed one to one by U.S. dollars.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:30:55):**  So people buy this cryptocurrency called Tether and they take the money that is invested and  
**[0:31:03-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:31:03):**  they put it in bank accounts and supposedly every dollar of Tether cryptocurrency is backed  
**[0:31:11-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:31:11):**  by one dollar of one U.S. dollar that is in a safe bank account.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:31:18):**  Now there are several issues with Tether.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:31:21):**  They haven't had any transparent auditing.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:31:24):**  Now I would argue for the listeners to Google it and see what comes up because for sure  
**[0:31:28-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:31:28):**  when I when this is published there will be another round of controversy around them.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:31:34):**  Right so it's quite controversial.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:31:36):**  There's this little transparency.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:31:38):**  And so the thought was that you know we can if we want to set this up as a nonprofit initiative  
**[0:31:48-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:31:48):**  where this terra fina we called it this terra fina framework is owned by a nonprofit that  
**[0:31:58-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:31:58):**  issues the tokens and raises the capital and then takes that money and invests it in farmland  
**[0:32:06-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:32:06):**  stewardship organizations.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:32:08):**  So just one step back so invested in farmland stewardship organizations or as you also call  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:32:14):**  them FSOs.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:32:16):**  Yes.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:32:17):**  So does that mean you're buying you're buying the land for these high prices and basically  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:32:20):**  helping the speculation or what does investing in this case mean.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:32:25):**  How do you get access to the land if you don't want to fuel the engine of speculation.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:32:30):**  Well I'm glad you mentioned that because that is a real point of contention.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:32:39):**  But the fact is that you know we we can you know the only way we can secure the land for  
**[0:32:47-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:32:47):**  sustainable use is to buy it.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:32:48):**  You know we can't disown people right.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:32:51):**  We're not living in a communist state.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:32:53):**  So the only tool we have available is to compete on the market and and and buy the land.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:02):**  What we have seen with this cooperative that has bought the land for the farm where I'm  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:08):**  at and has now bought land for 10 other farms and there's several other organizations like  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:13):**  this operational in Germany and in France Belgium.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:18):**  We have seen that people are willing to sell the land for a fairer price if they know if  
**[0:33:28-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:28):**  they know that the land is then going to be used in a sustainable way.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:31):**  So that's very interesting.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:33):**  So you can actually get a discount because you're operating or you're going to operate  
**[0:33:38-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:38):**  of course they have seen it you operate in other places sustainably.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:41):**  Which means that which is a huge thing if you think about it.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:44):**  I mean it's the same level as Dhanno now.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:46):**  I mean the news I think broke a few weeks ago that they will pay less on their huge  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:51):**  line of credit with a number of banks.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:53):**  They will pay less if they're ESG and their sustainability measures if they score high  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:57):**  on that.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:33:58):**  So actually a cost of capital is less if they are more sustainable.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:00):**  In this case you're saying that in some cases you've seen that the cost of land access are  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:06):**  less if you can operate it sustainably.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:08):**  That's very interesting.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:10):**  Yes.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:11):**  I think that's very encouraging and necessary.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:14):**  Well necessary to some extent.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:17):**  In the end you know it is a fact that land prices have gone up substantially in the last  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:25):**  especially in the last 20 years.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:29):**  In Germany well I can give you specific numbers for the last 10 years.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:32):**  So in the past 10 years land prices in Germany have gone up 150 percent.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:38):**  In neighboring Poland prices have gone up 700 percent.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:43):**  In Romania they've gone up 800 percent.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:45):**  So it's really really dramatic quite dramatic.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:49):**  And there's you know nothing a farmland stewardship organization can do about these market dynamics.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:34:56):**  The only thing we can do is to make sure that we buy the land and then it's secured for  
**[0:35:05-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:35:05):**  the long term.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:35:06):**  Yeah because that's the crux right.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:35:08):**  That's the long term part because of course if you buy it you cannot hold on to it and  
**[0:35:12-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:35:12):**  you're forced to sell at some point again when the organization has a cash flow problem  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:35:16):**  or one of the harvests fails you're still in the same in the same issues.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:35:22):**  Well you're not facing the same kind of financial pressure.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:35:25):**  If you are not promising investors a return.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:35:29):**  As Kulturland knows Jeff the cooperative that has bought the land here.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:35:33):**  They are not under the pressure that they have to produce a certain percentage in return.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:35:41):**  They can finance their operational costs through the low leases that they charge to farmers  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:35:48):**  and really an organization like that doesn't have a huge overhead.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:35:51):**  You know they just you know they have to manage legal stuff.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:35:54):**  They have to purchase the land.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:35:55):**  It has to be administered and the leases have to be signed and so on.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:36:03):**  But other than that it's not such a huge admin expense.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:36:10):**  And if you don't have investors that are then expecting returns then really the land.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:36:15):**  You have time.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:36:16):**  Right.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:36:17):**  So you're not taking up bank loans.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:36:18):**  You have investors in there who put their money in and are not expecting a return.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:36:26):**  But as we discussed earlier there are some limitations to that and actually one of the  
**[0:36:31-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:36:31):**  critical limitations is that well let's say that at one point in the future all of the  
**[0:36:38-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:36:38):**  shareholders would say OK the value of the land has increased several times a few hundred  
**[0:36:49-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:36:49):**  percent.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:36:50):**  We all vote to sell the land now.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:36:52):**  And because you know that's the democratic structure of such an organization there's  
**[0:36:58-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:36:58):**  really nothing you could do.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:01):**  So it's really not 100 percent secure.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:06):**  You know you're really counting on the goodwill and the idealism of the people who are part  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:10):**  of it.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:11):**  Which at the beginning probably everybody is aligned but of course things change.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:14):**  And if somebody comes in and offers a lot of money for the land for whatever reason  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:18):**  to either grow asparagus or make it a golf course.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:22):**  It could be interesting for more than half of the cooperative owners to at some point  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:27):**  take some money off the table.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:29):**  Right and that usually is what happens with farms in the second or third generation.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:35):**  You know the people who were running the farm and I am thinking of the people who invest  
**[0:37:40-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:40):**  it you know they're so idealistic they would never do that.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:43):**  But let's think one generation down the line.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:46):**  They inherit these shares you know they have no personal connection to this anymore.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:50):**  And then then you're really facing danger.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:53):**  How do you get around them.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:37:54):**  Well there's a very interesting model also in Germany by a syndicate that has found a  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:38:04):**  legal way to get around this in that.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:38:07):**  So they're doing this for real estate for housing.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:38:11):**  And there's OK.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:38:13):**  How can I put this really simply.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:38:15):**  Or if it's not simple I will ask a question.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:38:18):**  Right so OK.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:38:20):**  There's this central nonprofit entity and that entity holds a golden share in all other  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:38:28):**  legal entities which in this case would be the cooperative.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:38:33):**  And with that golden share it has a veto right a very specified veto right that gives it  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:38:40):**  the veto right on the sale of properties.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:38:44):**  So even if you know the organization the cooperative would want to sell land the central nonprofit  
**[0:38:52-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:38:52):**  entity whose sole purpose is to hold these shares these veto shares can you know then  
**[0:38:59-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:38:59):**  say no we veto that and then you know you can't sell the land again for speculative  
**[0:39:05-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:39:05):**  purposes.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:39:06):**  So this organization could theoretically hold a hundred thousand veto shares of a hundred  
**[0:39:12-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:39:12):**  thousand different projects.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:39:14):**  And the sole purpose is to the only thing they can veto just to be clear is when there  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:39:20):**  is a potential sale they cannot veto and anything else on the daily operation the cooperatives  
**[0:39:25-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:39:25):**  completely manage that as soon as somebody comes with a huge bag of money puts it on  
**[0:39:29-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:39:29):**  the table then this veto right could be used to basically block that sale of land because  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:39:37):**  in the initial it was meant to be a long term project and long term means not selling.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:39:43):**  Exactly that is exactly what it is.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:39:46):**  So this you know veto it sounds kind of scary but really this veto is only to ensure that  
**[0:39:53-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:39:53):**  the original idea ideals of the projects which in that case the mead toys are syndicates  
**[0:40:01-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:40:01):**  those are housing projects which follow the co-living housing and things like that like  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:40:08):**  a bit more like the new type of cooperatives owning social housing etc.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:40:14):**  Exactly what kind of yes not fancy penthouses I mentioned.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:40:18):**  No not at all so they're all kind of co-living kind of projects and there's currently 140  
**[0:40:27-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:40:27):**  of these housing projects in Germany which are part of this network where the central  
**[0:40:36-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:40:36):**  entity the mead toys are syndicates holds a veto share and all but one project so far  
**[0:40:43-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:40:43):**  has been a success.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:40:45):**  It's been going on for 30 years now one of them has filed for bankruptcy and the case  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:40:51):**  where you have a bankruptcy that is actually the only time when a property would be sold.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:40:56):**  So if a project cannot fund its operational expenses anymore it goes bankrupt then you  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:41:03):**  still actually have the underlying asset which is the property and so investors are still  
**[0:41:09-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:41:09):**  at least to some extent protected depending on what state the real estate is in it is  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:41:16):**  sold on the market and then investors are paid out proportionally and in such a case  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:41:21):**  of course the central entity the mead toys syndicate allows for the sale.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:41:27):**  And I would even see that actually because of this me as an idealistic investor at the  
**[0:41:32-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:41:32):**  beginning are more likely to do it because I know that maybe when I am no longer there  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:41:39):**  my shares are maybe owed by my children or grandchildren etc at least it's always protected  
**[0:41:43-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:41:43):**  the reason why I did this.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:41:46):**  Exactly right that's the whole idea of it you know so that it is protected over many  
**[0:41:52-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:41:52):**  many generations.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:41:54):**  So how do you put this to work in land and what does the blockchain have to do with that?  
**[0:41:59-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:41:59):**  Because they have been doing it for 30 years in real estate meaning that it is also possible  
**[0:42:02-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:42:02):**  on paper but I can imagine it is difficult.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:42:05):**  Right it is possible but it's been very cumbersome I would say to raise the funds for each individual  
**[0:42:17-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:42:17):**  project and the way we want to implement it in terms of the legal framework we want to  
**[0:42:23-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:42:23):**  adopt that that's a framework that has been proven by time and it works and you know so  
**[0:42:33-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:42:33):**  we want to build on something that works.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:42:36):**  The blockchain comes in that it allows for much larger amounts of capital to be raised  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:42:45):**  and that the foundation.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:42:49):**  Why is that?  
**[0:42:50-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:42:50):**  Why would it be much larger?  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:42:51):**  Because there's so much money going around tokens at the moment or in general?  
**[0:42:56-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:42:56):**  Right because there is on the one hand well it's much easier to invest in a cryptocurrency  
**[0:43:04-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:43:04):**  than to go and sign contracts and to buy shares right that's a very cumbersome process whereas  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:43:12):**  investing in tokens you can very easily just basically go online and pay by credit card.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:43:17):**  So anybody could do it basically?  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:43:20):**  Everyone can do it so that's kind of speaking to the existing crowds that is investing in  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:43:25):**  these kinds of projects so it's basically just a much easier way to enable that but  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:43:30):**  at the same time cryptocurrency investors and there's literally hundreds of billions  
**[0:43:36-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:43:36):**  of dollars in assets in cryptocurrencies out there because there's this huge volatility  
**[0:43:44-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:43:44):**  in the cryptocurrency market we can offer a value backed stable cryptocurrency as portfolio  
**[0:43:55-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:43:55):**  diversification for these cryptocurrency investors so they can take you know some of the money  
**[0:44:02-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:44:02):**  that they hold in Bitcoin and ether and in other cryptocurrencies and put it into our  
**[0:44:08-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:44:08):**  terra fina coins and be sure that it's backed in value because it's invested in land and  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:44:18):**  we think that it's a much more attractive proposition than for example tether where  
**[0:44:23-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:44:23):**  the money is put in a bank and for tether specifically their bank is in Taiwan and Taiwan  
**[0:44:31-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:44:31):**  actually doesn't have a legal framework that protects investors for cryptocurrencies whereas  
**[0:44:40-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:44:40):**  Switzerland actually has now clear legal boundaries legal guidelines that protect cryptocurrency  
**[0:44:49-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:44:49):**  investors when the cryptocurrency is asset backed then it's treated as a security just  
**[0:44:56-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:44:56):**  like a share of a company and so we have to adhere to all of the very very strict auditing  
**[0:45:06-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:45:06):**  and legal regulations in place in Switzerland and thus investors can be sure that the money  
**[0:45:14-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:45:14):**  that they put in there is secure so we can tap into this huge pool of money and use that  
**[0:45:24-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:45:24):**  to really do something good instead of you know just having that money lying on some  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:45:30):**  bank account for some people who who knows what they're doing with it right now I can  
**[0:45:35-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:45:35):**  imagine what they're doing with it for sure not buying hectares of land and leasing it  
**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:45:39):**  out to sustainable farmers right so where would you be buying so I'm buying these tokens  
**[0:45:44-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:45:44):**  and we're not going to go into all the technical details I will definitely post a link to the  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:45:50):**  project in the description but so I'm buying the tokens where would terra fina buy the  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:45:55):**  land is that Switzerland and bound because you're there or is it much more freely like  
**[0:46:01-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:46:01):**  it could also be Germany or France or even further further abroad yeah so we are really  
**[0:46:07-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:46:07):**  looking at first at Germany and France because there's these very well established farmland  
**[0:46:16-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:46:16):**  stewardship organizations that have the three that I'm looking at terra de lien in France  
**[0:46:24-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:46:24):**  that has existed for 10 years and been implementing this model of buying land and through and  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:46:31):**  raising money through issued shares that offer no return so you would be partnering with  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:46:36):**  with the with already established farmland stewardship organizations and helping them  
**[0:46:41-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:46:41):**  basically to to grow right exactly so we would raise the capital through the issued tokens  
**[0:46:49-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:46:49):**  and then invest in those existing organizations that have a very very solid track record and  
**[0:46:56-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:46:56):**  those three organizations I'm looking at the B.O.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:46:57):**  Bodengen Ostershaft in Germany Kulturland Genschlaff in Germany Kulturland Genschlaff  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:47:01):**  that I have a very close relationship with and the board of directors has approved to  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:47:07):**  be to be part of this from the beginning so I already have one organization that is partnering  
**[0:47:12-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:47:12):**  and terra de lien in France they together they have invested more than a hundred million  
**[0:47:16-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:47:16):**  euros in land so we would invest in those organizations we would the money that we raise  
**[0:47:23-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:47:23):**  we invest directly in those organizations and through this legal framework of veto right  
**[0:47:29-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:47:29):**  on the sale of land and a right of first refusal if land would under some circumstances in  
**[0:47:39-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:47:39):**  the case of bankruptcy have to be sold we would ask these organizations to give us as  
**[0:47:45-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:47:45):**  a non-profit organization a right of first refusal to purchase the land so that even  
**[0:47:50-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:47:50):**  if an organization would go bankrupt it's still protected you still get the chance to  
**[0:47:54-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:47:54):**  buy it and make sure it stays in the sustained and all the soil you've built is lost if they've  
**[0:48:01-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:48:01):**  built is lost right and and and that the asset actually still stays within the framework  
**[0:48:05-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:48:05):**  and is still backing the cryptocurrency in its value right so so we would just invest  
**[0:48:12-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:48:12):**  in those organizations rather than by land ourselves which we think would be an unhealthy  
**[0:48:20-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:48:20):**  concentration of power you know if one organization would raise billions and billions and we would  
**[0:48:27-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:48:27):**  we would manage all this land then you know we don't we don't necessarily have the know-how  
**[0:48:33-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:48:33):**  of you know the local underground know-how who you know should who are the actors that  
**[0:48:40-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:48:40):**  would be able to manage the land sustainably and so on and and there are literally hundreds  
**[0:48:45-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:48:45):**  of these farmland stewardship organizations in the world in many many countries in Australia  
**[0:48:52-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:48:52):**  and Belgium in the US there's many so we can work with them and really play the role of  
**[0:49:02-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:49:02):**  raising the capital and then investing it very locally in many many many different organizations  
**[0:49:09-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:49:09):**  and thus make sure that they locally know who to who the farmers are who they want to  
**[0:49:16-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:49:16):**  work with who's and really able to manage the land in a way that is really sustainable  
**[0:49:23-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:49:23):**  long term and as a token investor can I choose where my money goes and and what do I get  
**[0:49:30-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:49:30):**  in return as far as you know now I mean this project started in December it's it's all  
**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:49:36):**  much in process and fluid but what's your what are your thoughts at this moment 30th  
**[0:49:41-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:49:41):**  of March 2018 yeah yeah as you say it's it's early on but we do have ideas of what we want  
**[0:49:51-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:49:51):**  to implement in the future some of it is not technically feasible at this point so in the  
**[0:49:57-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:49:57):**  beginning as an investor the money is managed by terra fina and we then invest money in  
**[0:50:08-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:50:08):**  in the different farm and stewardship organizations but the idea is that in the future we would  
**[0:50:13-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:50:13):**  be able to put in place smart contracts where as an investor you could dedicate funds and  
**[0:50:22-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:50:22):**  say that money that you invest should be specifically dedicated to this or that organization or  
**[0:50:28-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:50:28):**  farm that is one line of thought and the other vision is that we in the future will establish  
**[0:50:39-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:50:39):**  our own blockchain and we will establish an ICO platform specifically for these farmland  
**[0:50:46-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:50:46):**  stewardship organizations that they can also issue tokens themselves now that only makes  
**[0:50:52-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:50:52):**  sense at a certain size of the organization because it does cost a certain amount of money  
**[0:50:59-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:50:59):**  cost about a hundred thousand dollars to be listed on on the token exchange and to issue  
**[0:51:06-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:51:06):**  tokens as a security you have to fulfill strict requirements you have to issue a prospectus  
**[0:51:13-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:51:13):**  and so on and that all costs a lot of money but at a certain size of an organization it  
**[0:51:21-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:51:21):**  would make sense that they can issue their own tokens so then we will provide the infrastructure  
**[0:51:28-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:51:28):**  for them to do that and then people could invest directly in those organizations and  
**[0:51:33-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:51:33):**  we would invest in those organizations through tokens instead of classical shares the way  
**[0:51:40-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:51:40):**  we would be doing in the beginning now as an investor what you get is a stable value  
**[0:51:47-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:51:47):**  cryptocurrency now that might not sound super attractive we we're not envisioning well we  
**[0:51:55-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:51:55):**  have been thinking about returns you know do we want to offer investors a return and  
**[0:52:04-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:52:04):**  we which would potentially make the market you're you're fishing in much bigger as many  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:52:10):**  people are currently getting maybe zero on their savings accounts or even in some parts  
**[0:52:15-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:52:15):**  of Switzerland minus so it there's even if you do one or two percent it already becomes  
**[0:52:21-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:52:21):**  it becomes an investment instead of looking for a stable stable currency but of course  
**[0:52:26-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:52:26):**  it brings a whole different suite of problems with it yeah and this really is an ideological  
**[0:52:33-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:52:33):**  debate to some extent in that you know the only way we could offer these returns is if  
**[0:52:38-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:52:38):**  we take into account the increase in market value of the land but really the whole idea  
**[0:52:46-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:52:46):**  of this framework is to decommoditize land to take the land off the market for good forever  
**[0:52:54-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:52:54):**  you know we don't want to sell it again so the money is to be made on the land not with  
**[0:52:58-0:53:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:52:58):**  the land right but yeah so so so that's that's in it's it's a bit of a conflict of ideas  
**[0:53:07-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:53:07):**  to think about offering a return on the increase in the value so we're tending towards saying  
**[0:53:18-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:53:18):**  we we do not want to incorporate or we do not want to pass on the increase in the value  
**[0:53:25-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:53:25):**  of the lands to the investors because we want to be clear you know we don't want to sell  
**[0:53:31-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:53:31):**  the land again so any any profits so to say that would arise from the increase in the  
**[0:53:38-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:53:38):**  value wouldn't be realized right because the land wouldn't be sold so it's really it would  
**[0:53:44-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:53:44):**  be a contradiction to do that but we think that looking at other stable value cryptocurrencies  
**[0:53:50-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:53:50):**  like tethers they have in the past 12 months raised more than 2 billion US dollars because  
**[0:53:57-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:53:57):**  the price of a stable currency could rise because there's a bigger need of a stable  
**[0:54:01-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:54:01):**  currency not necessarily because the value of the dollar in this case of the tetra or  
**[0:54:05-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:54:05):**  the the hectare of land is increasing but just the fact that there is a stable currency  
**[0:54:10-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:54:10):**  could become more attractive and more people want it that that's what you're saying but  
**[0:54:14-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:54:14):**  we we don't want to we want to keep it stable in the sense that we want to peg it to us  
**[0:54:20-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:54:20):**  dollar or euro so if the demand is great you know we we get a lot of capital inflow but  
**[0:54:26-0:54:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:54:26):**  we won't let the currency go up you know we just keep issuing new tokens okay yeah you  
**[0:54:31-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:54:31):**  were able to raise a million on very unattractive terms so there's there's definitely money  
**[0:54:35-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:54:35):**  in the market especially if it becomes a stable coin to to I mean it's part of a portfolio  
**[0:54:42-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:54:42):**  now it could be that you know if we're looking really long term let's say 20 30 50 60 years  
**[0:54:48-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:54:48):**  and let's say the terra fina tokens they become a mainstream everyday currency you know you're  
**[0:54:57-0:55:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:54:57):**  you're walking down the street in bookie nafaso and and you're seeing you know your love of  
**[0:55:01-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:55:01):**  bread in terra fina tokens right then then then we could actually you know use the tokens  
**[0:55:10-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:55:10):**  to buy land directly you know then then you're not kind of going through you know this peg  
**[0:55:15-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:55:15):**  anymore peg to the euro whatever you know who knows what happens to the euro in 20 years  
**[0:55:19-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:55:19):**  or even in 10 years or if we were in a situation where we would have hyperinflation for example  
**[0:55:27-0:55:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:55:27):**  let's say the euro completely loses its value you know we still have our land right so the  
**[0:55:34-0:55:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:55:34):**  value is still there so then we could readjust the value that it keeps its value you know  
**[0:55:43-0:55:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:55:43):**  what I mean right now the the inflation rate is like maybe one to two percent so nobody  
**[0:55:49-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:55:49):**  is thinking along these lines but if you have an inflation of 20 percent or even hyperinflation  
**[0:55:56-0:56:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:55:56):**  like they have in Venezuela all of this could could happen you know we've seen it historically  
**[0:56:02-0:56:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:56:02):**  happen many times then at least our cryptocurrency is backed by a real asset and then we could  
**[0:56:10-0:56:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:56:10):**  account for inflation and and and price that into the token and and and pass that on to  
**[0:56:16-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:56:16):**  the investors and and we still have to eat so at the end of the day where would you like  
**[0:56:23-0:56:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:56:23):**  your money or your value be be stored or be behold and where would be where would value  
**[0:56:29-0:56:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:56:29):**  be created which probably comes out of the land right probably piece of the sea right  
**[0:56:33-0:56:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:56:33):**  at the end of the day you know the land is the ultimate scarce resource it's it's better  
**[0:56:42-0:56:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:56:42):**  than the gold standard right I mean they're currently backed by land that's the safest  
**[0:56:47-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:56:47):**  thing you could think of if you can find people that can can work the land in a in a proper  
**[0:56:54-0:56:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:56:54):**  way absolutely yeah so that's that's really the grand vision and maybe one other aspect  
**[0:56:59-0:57:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:56:59):**  that I haven't mentioned so far is that we also want to set up a global blockchain land  
**[0:57:06-0:57:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:57:06):**  registry so of course right now every country has their own land registry so we would set  
**[0:57:14-0:57:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:57:14):**  that up parallel to the nation state land registries and import all of the information  
**[0:57:22-0:57:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:57:22):**  on land ownership and lease rights and so on into the global blockchain land registry  
**[0:57:30-0:57:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:57:30):**  so that we have absolute transparency on the ownership and the assets and and the land  
**[0:57:38-0:57:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:57:38):**  use rights and so on so that's there can be real trust in this framework and just to also  
**[0:57:46-0:57:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:57:46):**  be conscious of your time I want to ask and end with one final question we have much more  
**[0:57:51-0:57:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:57:51):**  to cover I think we could do another hour on just this one you just mentioned but I  
**[0:57:56-0:58:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:57:56):**  think that we'll keep that for another podcast sure let's imagine there's a theater full  
**[0:58:01-0:58:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:58:01):**  of smart impact investors listening to this podcast and they're they're on board they're  
**[0:58:05-0:58:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:58:05):**  thinking I need to get into regenerative agriculture I need to be able to support this farmland  
**[0:58:10-0:58:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:58:10):**  stewardship organizations I I want to either buy land or make land accessible or invest  
**[0:58:16-0:58:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:58:16):**  in infrastructure or invest in machinery what would your advice be for smart investors smart  
**[0:58:25-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:58:25):**  impact investors to to get into regenerative agriculture where to start what would be your  
**[0:58:29-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:58:29):**  first steps if they don't want to do a four and a half year biodynamic farmer training  
**[0:58:35-0:58:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:58:35):**  right well I think there is quite a few of these farmland stewardship organizations all  
**[0:58:42-0:58:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:58:42):**  over the world I know of many in Europe I know in the US in Australia so those are actually  
**[0:58:51-0:58:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:58:51):**  not so difficult to find there is I forget what the network is called in the US they  
**[0:58:57-0:59:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:58:57):**  have network of 500 of these organizations so I think everyone can can find one that  
**[0:59:05-0:59:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:59:05):**  is geographically close to them or pursues goals that is really aligning specifically  
**[0:59:13-0:59:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:59:13):**  with with their values so I think that is a fantastic investment or community supported  
**[0:59:22-0:59:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:59:22):**  farming is really taking off and has has been taking off in the US for 20 years and in Europe  
**[0:59:27-0:59:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:59:27):**  the past 10 years there's more than 10,000 community supported farms in the US there's  
**[0:59:34-0:59:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:59:34):**  some 2000 in France and then some 300 in Germany and most of those farms they rely on on loans  
**[0:59:41-0:59:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:59:41):**  to funds there to to pay for tractors and and operations right so you you could probably  
**[0:59:49-0:59:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:59:49):**  find one of these community supported farms in your region and go to them and say look  
**[0:59:56-1:00:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=0:59:56):**  okay you've got a bank loan you paying three percent whatever I'm not getting a good return  
**[1:00:01-1:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:00:01):**  on the money I have on the bank let's how about I lend you the money directly and we  
**[1:00:06-1:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:00:06):**  we you know we cut it in the middle and I take one and a half percent something like  
**[1:00:11-1:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:00:11):**  that and they would be happy and and you would know that your money is financing something  
**[1:00:15-1:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:00:15):**  positive and yeah I think that's that would have a huge impact.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:00:21):**  And one I always say final question and then I have another 10 in this case only one in  
**[1:00:27-1:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:00:27):**  with these CSAs that have been popping up everywhere and you're actually involved in  
**[1:00:32-1:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:00:32):**  one and do you see that it's now getting to a scale and by scale I don't mean that they  
**[1:00:37-1:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:00:37):**  need to manage 300,000 hectares etc but to a scale and also to a price point that it  
**[1:00:42-1:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:00:42):**  starts to be accessible for not just the happy few like does it get to a level where accessibility  
**[1:00:53-1:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:00:53):**  of food becomes because it's a huge issue obviously if you cannot afford it you end  
**[1:00:57-1:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:00:57):**  up in the cheaper aisle in the supermarket and probably not the most nutritious and healthiest  
**[1:01:03-1:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:01:03):**  especially for the soil and you do you see that there's a change going on that it's coming  
**[1:01:07-1:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:01:07):**  out of the niche and hopefully slowly to to slightly more more accessible and masses or  
**[1:01:14-1:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:01:14):**  we still need to go to another generation to get there.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:01:18):**  Right well I think this is would be a whole nother podcast on justice but I would say  
**[1:01:25-1:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:01:25):**  let's do that I would sum up to say that I think generally food is unrealistically cheap  
**[1:01:33-1:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:01:33):**  the way the way we it's priced in the supermarket because a lot of the external costs are not  
**[1:01:39-1:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:01:39):**  taken account for and these the CSAs specifically the ones I know okay they are on average more  
**[1:01:51-1:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:01:51):**  expensive than the supermarkets food but if you were to not be able to afford it like  
**[1:02:02-1:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:02:02):**  for example the the CSA where I'm at we leave it up to our members to decide how much they  
**[1:02:09-1:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:02:09):**  want to pay so we know you know on average we get a certain amount which is a higher  
**[1:02:14-1:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:02:14):**  price in the supermarket but some members they pay considerably less and some some pay  
**[1:02:22-1:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:02:22):**  more so there is a solidarity amongst this community and this is what I've observed on  
**[1:02:28-1:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:02:28):**  many of these CSAs and some of the members they really can't afford it and they help  
**[1:02:36-1:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:02:36):**  out on the farm we have some members they come once or twice a week and they help out  
**[1:02:42-1:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:02:42):**  with with their labor and pay for the food through that so really I think nobody is excluded  
**[1:02:49-1:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:02:49):**  on economic terms.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:02:52):**  No that's the important thing and let's dive into that in another podcast Thomas I want  
**[1:02:57-1:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:02:57):**  to thank you so much this is probably the longest podcast I've ever recorded and definitely  
**[1:03:03-1:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:03:03):**  let's check in let's dive deep into a few of the other topics and also let's keep checking

**[1:03:24-1:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:03:24):**  longest I did so far.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:03:26):**  I really enjoyed diving deeper into land prices and access and hope to explore some of the  
**[1:03:31-1:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:03:31):**  things we've raised here in future podcasts.

**[1:04:26-1:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:04:26):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[1:04:28-1:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:04:28):**  How to put money to work in regenerating soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while  
**[1:04:33-1:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:04:33):**  doing it.  
**[1:04:34-1:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:04:34):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:04:35-1:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:04:35):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[1:04:39-1:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:04:39):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[1:04:44-1:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:04:44):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:04:49-1:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:04:49):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:04:52-1:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:04:52):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[1:04:54-1:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:04:54):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[1:04:56-1:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:04:56):**  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  
**[1:05:01-1:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:05:01):**  What is happening in the space?

**[1:06:14-1:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:06:14):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture

**[1:06:46-1:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:06:46):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:06:48-1:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:06:48):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:06:50-1:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:06:50):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:06:54-1:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:06:54):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:06:56-1:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/#t=1:06:56):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:20):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:21):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:31):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:45):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:54):**  In March last year, we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:00:58-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:00:58):**  our work.

**[0:01:17-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:17):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:20):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:25):**  I'm Koen van Zeyen, your host.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:27):**  In these interviews, I'm talking to people who are scaling up the regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:30):**  sector, either by increasing the inflow of investment capital or by scaling up the enterprises  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:36):**  on and in the ground.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:38):**  And by doing so, exploring what it means to be an impact investor in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:43):**  Why am I focused on regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:46):**  Because the roots of so many of the issues we're facing in the world today can be found  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:50):**  in agriculture.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:51):**  From droughts, migrant flows, obesity, social issues, water wars, climate change, hunger,  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:01:57):**  they all have a connection to how we treat the land, grow food and what we eat.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:01):**  I hope you will enjoy this interview as much as I did making it.

**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:13):**  You're going to listen to an interview with Judith D. Swartz, writer, author of two very  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:18):**  important books in the regenerative agriculture space, one on cows and soil carbon mostly,  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:23):**  and one on water and the water systems we usually don't consider.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:27):**  Luckily, we had time to discuss many things in this interview, from how natural systems  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:32):**  work to manage particular problems, in this case, heat or carbon, how plants are running  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:36):**  the show, how plant life is actually cooling the planet, and of course, how it's actually  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:41):**  possible to restore large scale ecosystems, but that most people still don't know that.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:46):**  And that's really holding back this revolution.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:49):**  So enjoy.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:50):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, agriculture as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:54):**  I'm Koen van Zeyen, the host of today.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:02:56):**  And in the podcast today, I'm very lucky to be interviewing Judith D. Swartz, author  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:00):**  of two books, which were very instrumental to my personal view of regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:05):**  cows save the planet and her latest water in plain sight.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:09):**  Both of the books are full of examples from around the world on how to manage land very  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:13):**  differently.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:14):**  Welcome, Judith.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:15):**  Well, thank you.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:17):**  So to start with a personal question, how did you end up in the regenerative agriculture  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:22):**  space and ended up writing these two, but hopefully more very interesting books on this?  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:28):**  Well, it's always an interesting question to find out how people kind of leap into a  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:34):**  new area.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:35):**  And for me, there actually was an aha moment.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:39):**  So I had been writing about new economics, which is basically the notion that the economy  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:46):**  should serve the people and the planet as opposed to the other way around, in which  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:51):**  I fear that that's kind of where we are now, where people and the planet seem to exist  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:57):**  to serve the economy.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:03:59):**  So I was at a conference here in the state of Vermont in the US for slow money.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:07):**  Do you know about the slow money movement?  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:09):**  Yeah, I haven't had the pleasure to interview Woody Tash yet, but I've followed it and read  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:15):**  about it quite extensively.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:17):**  What's their slogan?  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:18):**  Bringing money from Wall Street to Main Street, right?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:22):**  Yes, yes.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:23):**  Bringing money down to earth.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:25):**  So basically, it's a critique that one of our challenges right now is that money moves  
**[0:04:29-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:29):**  too quickly, that it's kind of spinning around quickly in an ever more abstract way, chasing  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:37):**  finer and finer profit margins rather than doing the work in actual communities and keeping  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:44):**  money in the community.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:46):**  So what they've been doing is steering investment towards small food enterprises that are, by  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:53):**  definition, local.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:04:55):**  So I was at this conference, and I heard a statement that simply would not let me go.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:02):**  And that was that over time, more CO2 has gone into the atmosphere from agricultural  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:09):**  practice from the soil compared to the burning of fossil fuels.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:15):**  And that fairly hit me over the head, because I felt that I was somewhat knowledgeable about  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:21):**  climate change.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:23):**  And my assumption had always been that it was all about fossil fuels.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:27):**  But here was another element.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:29):**  And my reaction was, well, if indeed it has anything to do with the soil, if the soil  
**[0:05:35-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:35):**  has been the source of much of the carbon that we have been lofting into the atmosphere  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:43):**  over time, well, that certainly seems like something we might want to know.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:47):**  So I started exploring that.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:50):**  And as I explored carbon in the soil and how we lose carbon in the soil, which is by tilling,  
**[0:05:57-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:05:57):**  which is by industrial agricultural practices such as adding a lot of synthetic nitrogen,  
**[0:06:05-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:05):**  such as leaving soil bare, which happens in a lot of our industrial agriculture, well,  
**[0:06:15-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:15):**  then I posed the question, then if we reverse that, can we bring carbon back from the atmosphere  
**[0:06:23-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:23):**  into the soil?  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:24):**  And so that kind of sent me on this whole journey to understand how soil works.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:31):**  And I learned that by drawing down carbon into the soil, that not only reduces the load  
**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:39):**  of atmospheric carbon, but also it's really important for the water cycle, because carbon  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:46):**  in the soil acts as a sponge.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:49):**  And that allows us to hold water.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:51):**  In fact, I'll give you a statistic, because I think it's just so important at a time that  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:06:57):**  we are collectively concerned about water and water-based crises such as floods and  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:03):**  droughts are a problem all over the world.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:07):**  And the statistic is this, that for every increase of soil organic carbon of 1%, that  
**[0:07:16-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:16):**  represents an additional 27,000 gallons per acre of water that can be held in the soil.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:26):**  And that is huge, because with all that water being held in the soil, that means that that's  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:34):**  a whole extra layer of resilience that we have.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:38):**  That means that we can last that much longer between watering in terms of growing of plants  
**[0:07:46-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:46):**  and also when we're holding that water, it makes it that much harder to make a flood  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:54):**  because the land absorbs the water.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:07:56):**  So anyway, as you can see, I got very excited about the possibilities inherent in the restoration  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:03):**  of soil.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:05):**  And that led me to write a book about soil, which as you said is Cows Save the Planet  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:10):**  and Other Improbable Ways of Restoring Soil to Heal the Earth.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:15):**  And it's basically kind of a soil's eye view of the world, a look at many of our environmental  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:22):**  and economic challenges and how soil is a hub for them.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:28):**  That the depletion of the soil makes these problems more of a problem.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:34):**  And by restoring the soil, we can address these many problems.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:38):**  That is extremely interesting.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:40):**  And how did you, as a journalist, you're writing books, how did you choose cows as the first  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:49):**  entry point and then water instead of, for instance, the other way around?  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:54):**  So the title Cows Save the Planet, I mean, that's a little bit to draw attention.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:08:59):**  It works.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:09:00):**  Yes, to alert the reader to the fact that in this book, you will be surprised.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:09:06):**  And the way that I came upon that is twofold.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:09:10):**  So the title is a nod to holistic plan grazing, holistic management being a decision-making  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:09:17):**  framework that has been developed by a fellow named Alan Savery, who is from Zimbabwe, lives  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:09:24):**  part-time in the US and part-time in Zimbabwe and these days part-time traveling around  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:09:30):**  the world talking about how we can reverse desertification.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:09:36):**  So that's how I came to use that.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:09:40):**  But in a very literal, how do you pick a title for your book perspective, I was thinking  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:09:48):**  about it and writing a book about soil.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:09:50):**  I mean, soil is kind of like a word that might, in many instances, end the conversation.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:09:55):**  Oh, I'm writing a book about soil.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:09:57):**  And someone might look at you and say, okay, that sounds very interesting.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:10:01):**  I think I'll move to the next person I might meet at this cocktail party.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:10:06):**  But just soil isn't considered sexy, although these days people are understanding just how  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:10:12):**  important soil is.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:10:13):**  And there's a whole kind of soil movement that I can also mention.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:10:18):**  But so I was wondering what title can I choose for a book about soil?  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:10:25):**  Because I just didn't think that a title like Soil is Really Important, We Should Care About  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:10:30):**  It was going to work.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:10:32):**  And I was just wandering around my house and noticed a book that my son had strewn on the  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:10:39):**  floor.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:10:40):**  And it was a comic book by Gary Larson of the Far Side comics that are always very amusing  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:10:49):**  and often draw on talking animals.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:10:53):**  And the title of that book was Cows of Our Planet.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:10:56):**  I thought, hmm, Cows of Our Planet.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:00):**  Cows save the planet.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:01):**  So that's how I came up with that title.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:05):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:06):**  And I still remember the first time I read something about holistic management was in  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:10):**  a book, something like 12 Solutions to Save the Planet, something like that.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:15):**  It was the story of Tony Lovell and Bruce Ward down in Australia.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:21):**  And that was the first time I read something also about Alan Savery, because it was mentioned  
**[0:11:25-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:25):**  there.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:26):**  And it was an aha moment.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:30):**  The whole soil, water, drought, cow discussion is slightly more complicated or complex than  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:36):**  we lead to believe.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:38):**  Right.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:39):**  Right.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:40):**  And so the way I often look at it is so in trying to understand challenges that we have,  
**[0:11:47-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:47):**  one can look at natural systems and ask, how did our natural environments deal with those  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:55):**  challenges?  
**[0:11:56-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:11:56):**  And holistic management, this particular way of approaching the management of grazing animals,  
**[0:12:05-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:12:05):**  it resolves a challenge that in nature, how do arid environments, specifically areas of  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:12:16):**  seasonal rainfall, which is a large percentage of our climate, it happens to be of our planet,  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:12:22):**  not where you live in the Netherlands or where I live in Vermont in the United States, where  
**[0:12:28-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:12:28):**  we have moisture distributed fairly evenly throughout the year.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:12:31):**  But in much of the world, we have rainy season and a dry season.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:12:37):**  And so nature had the challenge, how do we maintain moisture in the soil in order to  
**[0:12:44-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:12:44):**  sustain plant and microbial life from the end of one rainy season to the beginning of  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:12:52):**  the next?  
**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:12:53):**  And the solution that nature came up with was through the behavior and the digestive  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:13:00):**  system of grazing animals.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:13:03):**  So since the way that we humans have been managing the earth, we lack the predators  
**[0:13:13-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:13:13):**  that had managed those animals and we lack the huge roving herds that had existed in  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:13:21):**  these seasonally dry landscapes through history.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:13:26):**  And so that leaves a void.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:13:28):**  So that void can be filled by humans managing grazing animals in a way that they had acted  
**[0:13:38-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:13:38):**  in natural ecosystems so that the grazing animals, they would nibble the plants in a  
**[0:13:46-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:13:46):**  way that stimulated the growth of plants, their waste hydrated and fertilized the soil,  
**[0:13:54-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:13:54):**  and their trampling pressed in the decaying, the dying plant matter, the dried out plant  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:14:02):**  matter so that it could be acted upon by the microbial life, all of which maintain moisture  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:14:09):**  in the soil.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:14:10):**  And those animals were in turn were managed by predators that would keep them on the move.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:14:17):**  And without those predators in our landscapes right now, then we humans can manage those  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:14:24):**  animals in the same way.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:14:26):**  And if you look, because it's a very, I mean, it's funny how we both not coming from a,  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:14:31):**  let's say a rangeland with wet and dry seasons got so interested in that topic.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:14:37):**  But it's a side note.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:14:39):**  I mean, if you, because this looks at the movement of livestock on rangeland, and then  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:14:44):**  you decided to, for the latest book, to take it a bit more broader and at the same time  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:14:49):**  more specific, and you ended up on water.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:14:53):**  Did that come down because of you looked at soil and then basically, like you mentioned  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:14:59):**  before, the enormous role soil carbon plays with water?  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:02):**  Or how did it come about and you decided to write a book on water and especially water  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:07):**  that we normally don't consider or don't even look at or don't see?  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:12):**  That's right.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:13):**  The water that, so it's a look at how water moves across the landscape and through the  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:18):**  atmosphere.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:19):**  It's a look at the water processes, how at water processes.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:24):**  Sometimes when I explain the book, I say that it's an exploration of water as a verb as  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:30):**  opposed to merely water as a noun.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:34):**  Because we often think of water as a thing that can be divided up and maybe I have water  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:41):**  and you want it and so we fight over it as if water were a matter of zero sum, that one  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:47):**  person gets it, one country gets it.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:49):**  Like we used to think about economy.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:51):**  Exactly.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:52):**  Exactly.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:53):**  So a couple of things happened.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:15:55):**  One thing that happened was here in the US, we had the California drought when so much  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:16:03):**  of our produce, our fruits and nuts and vegetables are grown in California.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:16:09):**  And so with the drought, that was really putting a lot of stress on California's ability to  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:16:16):**  maintain its extraordinary agricultural production.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:16:21):**  And of course, California has such a huge population.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:16:23):**  So when Californians are inconvenienced, that means many, many, many millions of people  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:16:29):**  are feeling it.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:16:31):**  But what struck me was that in our conversations, our public conversations about the California  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:16:37):**  drought, what was missing was land.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:16:41):**  That drought was looked upon as a matter of what does or doesn't come down from the sky.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:16:47):**  And land degradation was not mentioned at all.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:16:51):**  And I felt that this was something that really needed to be corrected for us to truly address  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:16:59):**  our water challenges in this country.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:17:01):**  So there was actually, it was very amused, there was one article that made the rounds  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:17:07):**  in California, all over the US during the California drought.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:17:12):**  And the headline was something like, we needed, I think it was 11 trillion Olympic swimming  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:17:21):**  pools worth of rainfall so that we could beat the drought.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:17:26):**  And that amused me because, well, that's all very well and good.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:17:31):**  But if we continue to degrade the land, the huge expanses of land in California that are  
**[0:17:39-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:17:39):**  used as, that are rangelands, once thriving grasslands or agricultural lands, if we mismanage  
**[0:17:48-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:17:48):**  them well, then 11 trillion swimming pools worth of rainfall won't really help the problem.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:17:55):**  In fact, that would be a waste of perfectly good swimming pool water.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:18:00):**  However, if we did restore those lands and really focused on how to manage them better,  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:18:07):**  then maybe we could get away with much less in terms of our swimming pool use of water.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:18:12):**  So I sort of laughed at that.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:18:16):**  So that was one motivation to write the book Water in Plain Sight, to bring land to the  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:18:23):**  center of our conversations about water.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:18:27):**  And the other aspect was that in the writing of Cow Save the Planet, I was struck by a  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:18:35):**  huge missed opportunity that we have in terms of climate change.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:18:41):**  That while we look at climate change as a matter of carbon, we're missing the fact that  
**[0:18:48-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:18:48):**  water is a huge thermoregulator of our planet, that our water processes, infiltration, transpiration,  
**[0:19:03-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:19:03):**  evaporation, condensation, have such a huge impact on the energy balance of our planet  
**[0:19:12-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:19:12):**  that I wanted to bring in water as it can affect climate.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:19:19):**  So in other words, right now when we make the connection between water and climate,  
**[0:19:24-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:19:24):**  we look at how climate change may affect our water sources and perhaps the water cycle  
**[0:19:33-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:19:33):**  itself in terms of more intense storms, that warmer atmosphere means that more moisture  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:19:41):**  is held in the atmosphere.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:19:46):**  But we really hadn't looked at how we can work with the water cycle to help cool the  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:19:54):**  planet.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:19:55):**  And I felt that that was a gap that needed to be filled.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:19:58):**  So to basically look at it as almost a human body that's able to sweat and of course naturally  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:20:04):**  cools us and probably that system is in use in other parts of the earth and not just on  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:20:10):**  our skin when it's a summer day.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:20:12):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:20:14):**  So what really, really interests me in particular is this wonderful water process called transpiration,  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:20:23):**  which is the upward movement of water through plants.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:20:28):**  And at a very basic level, that consumes energy.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:20:33):**  Basically it takes the solar radiation that descends upon the earth and hits the surface  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:20:42):**  of the earth.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:20:44):**  And rather than sensible heat, which is what you get if you have no plants there, if you  
**[0:20:50-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:20:50):**  have let's say pavement, a sidewalk, or a degraded landscape which is not supporting  
**[0:20:59-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:20:59):**  plant growth, then you get sensible heat and that surface of the earth heats up.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:21:06):**  But when you have plants on the surface, those plants are cooling the surface.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:21:15):**  It's taking that solar energy and it's dispersing it and turning it into latent heat, which  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:21:23):**  is embodied in the water vapor.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:21:27):**  So I just think it's such an extraordinary thing that plants are continually cooling  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:21:35):**  our climate, cooling the planet, and yet we don't give them any credit for it.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:21:41):**  And if you look at the book or the research you did for the book, is that also the story  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:21:48):**  that jumps out most?  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:21:50):**  If somebody asks you, could you tell one example or one story or is there another one in the  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:21:55):**  book that really tells this story as well, Vapor, but then more on the ground?  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:00):**  Wow.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:01):**  Well, there are so many stories, but basically-  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:04):**  I know it's a tricky one.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:05):**  Yeah, it is a tricky one.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:06):**  But to answer your question, if someone said, what did I learn from this book that has stuck  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:16):**  with me and continues to drive me?  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:18):**  Yeah, or surprised you.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:20):**  The first is that plants are running the show, the extent to which plants are running the  
**[0:22:26-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:26):**  show.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:27):**  So there's an Australian farmer author, kind of maverick thinker named Peter Andrews.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:35):**  And there's a quote from him that I like to refer to because I think it's so telling.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:43):**  And that is this, that plants manage water and in managing water, they are managing heat.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:53):**  And that to me is really, really powerful.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:22:57):**  And then a corollary to that is that he notes that that kind of, again, this goes back to  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:23:05):**  the question that I like to ask, which is how did natural systems deal with a particular  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:23:11):**  challenge?  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:23:12):**  What are the challenges to manage the heat inherent in the solar radiation that the planet  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:23:18):**  receives every day?  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:23:20):**  And so Peter Andrews calls attention to the role of plants in that management.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:23:25):**  And he also notes that we have, I was about to say, I'm trying to think, de-vegetated.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:23:32):**  I knew that there was a word I was trying for.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:23:35):**  De-vegetated about one quarter of the planet by paving over it, by building buildings that  
**[0:23:43-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:23:43):**  have surfaces that are absorbing heat, and by deforesting, and by cutting down, by having  
**[0:23:56-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:23:56):**  areas of land that are degraded and are therefore not supporting plant life.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:24:03):**  So that's about one quarter of the planet that is no longer managing solar radiation  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:24:11):**  as effectively.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:24:13):**  And so while on the one hand, that's a very distressing fact, the way I like to turn it  
**[0:24:19-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:24:19):**  around and say, wow, what an opportunity we have to start managing the heat better.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:24:26):**  So we do have lots of opportunities, but we need to understand what it is that we want  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:24:31):**  to do in order to restore ecosystem function all over the earth.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:24:37):**  And if you look at, let's say, a year ago until now, you released a book.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:24:45):**  Obviously you've had a lot of discussions on water and water in a bigger system and  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:24:50):**  water systems.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:24:52):**  Have you seen the discussion change in the last year or so?  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:24:57):**  And if so, what has changed?  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:24:58):**  So in terms of water, I have not seen it change.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:25:02):**  And one thing I think that must be said is that here in the United States, the conversations  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:25:09):**  about ecology have kind of stalled.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:25:12):**  I don't want to say they've stalled.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:25:14):**  That's overstating it.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:25:16):**  But at this point in the US, people are so distracted by politics.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:25:22):**  I don't mean to say that as a judgment, because I'm distracted too.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:25:25):**  But I think that it has really taken our focus away from ecological processes, which is really  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:25:33):**  a shame because we need to be focusing on that more.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:25:37):**  So I haven't seen the conversation change around water, but I have seen a tremendous  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:25:43):**  change in the conversation around soil.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:25:46):**  So I can say that, so the Cow Save the Planet, the book on soil came out in 2013.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:25:53):**  When I was writing that book, it was basically kind of me sitting here at my desk in Vermont  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:26:01):**  reading information about the importance of soil carbon, about the importance of soil  
**[0:26:07-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:26:07):**  for biodiversity, about what wonderful things happen to areas when the soil is restored.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:26:14):**  And I was sitting here by my lonesome saying, oh my gosh, this is amazing.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:26:19):**  I mean, I had my sources.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:26:21):**  But it was really kind of me in contact with my sources, in contact with my editor, in  
**[0:26:27-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:26:27):**  isolation.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:26:28):**  Whereas now, there are several global and local organizations organized all around soil  
**[0:26:37-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:26:37):**  restoration.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:26:40):**  And articles being written all the time, and just internationally conversations around  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:26:47):**  the importance of soil and soil carbon are happening just constantly.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:26:52):**  So it's a very, very different thing compared to when I was writing that book.  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:26:58):**  So that's exciting.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:26:59):**  I mean, I can just rattle off names of a few of these organizations.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:27:03):**  So there's Regeneration International, which is all about regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:27:09):**  There's the Carbon Underground.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:27:12):**  There's Biodiversity for a Livable Climate.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:27:15):**  Soil for Climate, Soil for Climate Vermont.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:27:19):**  There's Soil Solutions, which is part of the Center for Food Safety.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:27:24):**  There's Kiss the Ground, which is based in Los Angeles.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:27:28):**  So all these organizations, and I'm sure I've missed a few, the Soil Carbon Coalition, that's  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:27:33):**  been going on, but that's been expanding.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:27:36):**  And they do incredible work, including there's now an app, which is an atlas of biological  
**[0:27:43-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:27:43):**  work so that you can see the impact of restoration of soil and how that enhances the capacity,  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:27:53):**  that lands the capacity for photosynthesis.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:27:56):**  So there are all kinds of, there's all kinds of work going on.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:28:01):**  Just another couple of examples that your listeners may or may not know about.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:28:06):**  There's the 4 per 1000 initiative, which was introduced at COP 21 in Paris.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:28:13):**  And this has been driven by the French Agricultural Ministry.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:28:17):**  And it's a voluntary initiative in which nations or entities, NGOs, organizations, all kinds  
**[0:28:28-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:28:28):**  of entities can pledge to increase soil carbon at a rate of 4 per 1000, 0.4% per year.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:28:41):**  And by doing that, if we do that in a, I think it's all agricultural lands globally, then  
**[0:28:48-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:28:48):**  we can stall the increase of adding carbon to the atmosphere.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:28:55):**  They talk about the carbon gap.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:28:58):**  So that we need to not only stop emissions, but we need to also start drawing down.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:29:06):**  And so the 4 per 1000 initiative calls attention to the capacity for us to start drawing down  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:29:13):**  carbon.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:29:15):**  Just last week in Rome, there was from the FAO, the UN organization, an event focused  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:29:26):**  on the opportunities inherent in soil carbon sequestration.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:29:32):**  So this is happening constantly now, and it's really, really exciting because, as I said,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:29:38):**  when I was just beginning to get into this area, I felt very much like a voice in the  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:29:43):**  wilderness.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:29:44):**  But now I am among many, many colleagues, and that is a really good feeling.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:29:52):**  That's amazing to hear.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:29:54):**  And I will make sure I'll link to all of the organizations you mentioned and the initiatives  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:29:59):**  down below.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:30:00):**  And if you look at the agriculture space, you talk a lot with farmers, you talk a lot  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:30:05):**  with ranchers and land users.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:30:08):**  Has that discussion changed?  
**[0:30:10-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:30:10):**  And what do you see as the biggest opportunities for the next, let's say, year or two years?  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:30:17):**  What do you hope to see changing in your discussions with the people that at the end are responsible  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:30:23):**  for managing the lands?  
**[0:30:25-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:30:25):**  Okay, well, where I think that it has changed is that regenerative agriculture has become  
**[0:30:32-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:30:32):**  a much more known concept and a phrase that can be used to communicate with consumers  
**[0:30:40-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:30:40):**  so that people can buy products that are not only not hurting the environment, but that  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:30:50):**  are actively restoring the environment.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:30:53):**  So for an example, here in Vermont, there is a fellow named Jesse McDougall who has  
**[0:31:00-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:31:00):**  a sheep farm, and he has a regenerative CSA.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:31:04):**  So my husband and I purchased lamb from that farm, and I have actually seen how that farm  
**[0:31:15-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:31:15):**  is restoring land.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:31:17):**  I've seen where the grasses are growing much more fully and that there's much more biodiversity  
**[0:31:27-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:31:27):**  in the plants that are growing.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:31:29):**  The land is healthier.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:31:32):**  One little story that Jesse told me is that when the land started getting better, when  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:31:39):**  there was more carbon in the soil, which supported the growth of grasses, and then the growth  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:31:45):**  of grasses supports the carbon in the soil and it kept getting better and better, that  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:31:51):**  as the land improved, foxes returned.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:31:55):**  And as the foxes returned, then the number of ticks, these are little insects that are  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:03):**  kind of haunting us here in Vermont and in much of the US.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:06):**  I also hear the Lyme disease is striking.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:10):**  Oh, are they there too?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:12):**  I did not know that you had it there.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:14):**  Is that true that you have it?  
**[0:32:16-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:16):**  Yeah, they've been moving because there are many reasons why probably, but for sure heating  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:23):**  climate plus less animals outside, they're looking for another host, which usually ends  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:29):**  up being either a pet or a human being.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:33):**  So after you've been outside, you need to check.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:35):**  Right.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:36):**  This is news to me that that's the case in the Netherlands, but I can tell you that here  
**[0:32:41-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:41):**  in Vermont, this is personal because I did get a tick illness, not Lyme, but something  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:48):**  called anaplasmosis last year.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:50):**  And I'm really, really lucky that I was only knocked off my feet for about five weeks.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:32:56):**  So when Jesse told me that because the foxes have returned and that means that the rodents  
**[0:33:04-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:33:04):**  that were carrying these ticks are now being managed, their population is being managed  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:33:11):**  by the predators, that the ticks have disappeared, that certainly caught my attention because  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:33:18):**  I just know that I know how damaging these animals can be.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:33:22):**  So that actually brings up the topic of biodiversity.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:33:27):**  And I want to call attention to that because that was something that was really interesting  
**[0:33:31-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:33:31):**  to me in the book.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:33:32):**  So I went to an area of Mexico, the Chihuahuan Desert, where there's a really interesting  
**[0:33:41-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:33:41):**  project that's happening right now, which is that bird conservation organizations are  
**[0:33:48-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:33:48):**  working with ranchers to create habitat for endangered migratory grassland birds.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:33:56):**  And this is fascinating and again surprising because we don't really think that the presence  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:34:03):**  of livestock can help something like bird habitat.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:34:08):**  But basically because these ranchers are using their management of livestock to restore the  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:34:19):**  land, they are creating this habitat and the birds are returning.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:34:24):**  So that was really interesting.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:34:26):**  So they are restoring the land and they are restoring the water cycle, which allows for  
**[0:34:34-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:34:34):**  the grasses to grow, which allows for these birds that otherwise would have no place to  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:34:41):**  nest, no place to hide from predators and no food.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:34:46):**  It creates a good environment for these birds.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:34:51):**  So I was exploring that and I found it interesting, although it wasn't particularly surprising,  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:34:58):**  that when you restore the water cycle, that is good for biodiversity.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:35:03):**  That kind of follows logically that when you have a healthy water cycle that you can support  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:35:09):**  more different kinds of species.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:35:13):**  But that is something that I did observe there and that was really good to see because where  
**[0:35:17-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:35:17):**  I was, it was not only the birds that they were supporting, but all other kinds of species  
**[0:35:25-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:35:25):**  of insects, butterflies, and also predators.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:35:32):**  But what was also interesting and what I didn't expect was that it works the other way as  
**[0:35:39-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:35:39):**  well, that when you restore biodiversity, that helps restore the water cycle.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:35:47):**  So it helped me see that a lot of what we're dealing with when we're having problems with  
**[0:35:54-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:35:54):**  the water cycle, when there's too much flooding, we're losing water in the landscape too quickly  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:36:00):**  so that the land is not holding the water and therefore we're getting floods or we're  
**[0:36:06-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:36:06):**  having droughts or we're having erosion because the rain creates gullies and we're losing  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:36:16):**  topsoil because the water streams off the landscape so quickly.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:36:20):**  But when we restore biodiversity, that biodiversity helps us restore the water cycle.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:36:29):**  So when we bring back such animals as beavers or prairie dogs, that that is slowing down  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:36:39):**  the water, that is holding water on the land.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:36:43):**  Other creatures that we might not think about because they're not so obvious or as cute  
**[0:36:48-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:36:48):**  and cuddly like earthworms and dung beetles, those also help create in the land space for  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:36:59):**  the water to percolate and linger in the soil.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:37:04):**  So it's not just leaving the landscape so quickly and leaving the land often dry.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:37:12):**  I think that the whole notion of it's not a zero sum game and when you bring back biodiversity  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:37:18):**  that of course also uses water, it's actually not taking water away from your farm, your  
**[0:37:24-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:37:24):**  livestock, your produce, etc.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:37:25):**  But it actually adds more and probably more than it's taking away.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:37:29):**  So that's I think quite a lot of organic or sustainable farmers or biodynamic farmers  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:37:35):**  or whatever we call them always knew that.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:37:39):**  But getting that into the current agriculture system I think is essential and actually gets  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:37:45):**  me to a question that which is a first in this podcast that a previous guest asked a  
**[0:37:49-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:37:49):**  question to a future guest.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:37:51):**  We have Joanne Gais of Landlife Company that read your book and asked me to ask you the  
**[0:37:57-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:37:57):**  following question where he said the book offers a very interesting array of examples  
**[0:38:03-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:38:03):**  of very inspiring examples of relatively small scale projects or relatively small scale initiatives.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:38:10):**  What would be necessary to fix this on a world scale, on a global scale?  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:38:15):**  What is necessary to get this to that level in your view?  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:38:20):**  I would say it's a matter of awareness because we're still thinking very small.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:38:25):**  I mean you just had a perfect example right there that the notion that say having more  
**[0:38:32-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:38:32):**  cattle on the land can actually generate water in the landscape.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:38:38):**  That's something that I don't think that most people have been able to grasp.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:38:44):**  I mean we're used to thinking in linear terms as opposed to whole system terms.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:38:54):**  So I think that that's one example of what's needed is just for us to think more systemically.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:39:04):**  And in the US I mean I'm not really knowledgeable about policy in other parts of the world such  
**[0:39:12-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:39:12):**  as Europe but here in the US all of our regulations and our farm agricultural policies is fixed  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:39:23):**  in a sense to support industrial agriculture.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:39:28):**  Whereas industrial agriculture is ravaging the surface of our planet and in doing so  
**[0:39:37-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:39:37):**  it is interfering with ecological processes in a really, really important way.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:39:45):**  So I think if we shift our understanding of wealth away from what is produced to and towards  
**[0:39:59-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:39:59):**  function because without ecological function nothing can be produced.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:40:06):**  I think that that is the shift that we need to make.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:40:10):**  I hope that I said that in a way that makes sense.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:40:15):**  Please let me know if I need to elaborate on that.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:40:21):**  I think for me it makes a lot of sense and it's a really interesting discussion to have  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:40:28):**  that with impact investors who of course try to balance those two things.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:40:32):**  Like I want to invest in the future but I still want to invest and not do philanthropy.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:40:37):**  So that discussion at least in that little niche of investors is very normal.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:40:43):**  But I think if you can elaborate on it a bit just for the people that are not used to have  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:40:48):**  that discussion and maybe come more from the agriculture side or from the Wall Street side  
**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:40:52):**  that would be great.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:40:54):**  Our financial system does not make any sense because we are rewarded for practices that  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:41:05):**  are ultimately diminishing our natural wealth.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:41:11):**  So we are companies, corporations, investors.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:41:18):**  We're at a moment in which our earnings come from extraction from the planet whereas we  
**[0:41:31-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:41:31):**  also know that that is diminishing our future capacity to continue to produce what we need  
**[0:41:42-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:41:42):**  to produce to feed and sustain the people that are living on the earth and the numbers  
**[0:41:49-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:41:49):**  that will be added until hopefully that number will stabilize.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:41:54):**  So it's a very, very weird moment.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:41:58):**  It's a kind of cognitive dissonance.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:42:01):**  And I would say that the political challenges, the political tension that we have certainly  
**[0:42:11-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:42:11):**  here in the US and by extension because we are all interdependent and what happens in  
**[0:42:19-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:42:19):**  the US has ripple effects all over the world.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:42:22):**  So by extension the political tension globally, I would say that this is a symptom of that  
**[0:42:33-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:42:33):**  economic and ecological cognitive dissonance that it's not working but our institutions  
**[0:42:44-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:42:44):**  have not figured out a way to get things to work.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:42:52):**  I hope that's not too abstract because I'm still kind of working out my own understanding  
**[0:42:57-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:42:57):**  of this but we are at a really, really important inflection point.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:43:05):**  And restoration, restorative processes are what will rebuild our wealth, the natural  
**[0:43:13-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:43:13):**  basis for our wealth.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:43:16):**  And one thing that I just really think is so important because I don't think that most  
**[0:43:22-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:43:22):**  people know this is that we can massively, we can restore those ecological processes  
**[0:43:30-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:43:30):**  and we can do so on a large scale.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:43:34):**  And I think that people don't really know that.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:43:38):**  I think partly because we don't see ecological change and because we tend to look at how  
**[0:43:50-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:43:50):**  conditions are right now and assume that it has always been that way.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:43:57):**  So it was very illuminating to me when I was in Chihuahua, Mexico with a rancher named  
**[0:44:05-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:44:05):**  Alejandro Carrillo and he was showing me land and he pointed to some land that was really  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:44:14):**  in pretty bad shape, that there was very little that was growing there, maybe a little bit  
**[0:44:20-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:44:20):**  of mesquite which in the Southwest United States is considered a kind of pest species.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:44:27):**  CB, IAN, and RL, invasive species.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:44:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:44:30):**  KF Right.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:44:31):**  So the land looked pretty bad and he just sighed and he shook his head and he said,  
**[0:44:36-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:44:36):**  when I was growing up in the 1970s, this was the best land.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:44:42):**  This is where the best grasses were growing.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:44:46):**  And so most people looking at that land would only see the way it is today.  
**[0:44:52-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:44:52):**  But also the stories of where land is restored have not been sufficiently told.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:45:03):**  Most people don't know that it's possible to restore land and to do so on a really pretty  
**[0:45:11-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:45:11):**  massive scale.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:45:13):**  So one of the best examples of large scale land restoration is the restoration of the  
**[0:45:19-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:45:19):**  Los Plateau in China.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:45:23):**  And that's a story that's been told in a really powerful way by a Chinese American  
**[0:45:30-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:45:30):**  filmmaker named John D. Liu, L-I-U.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:45:36):**  And it was pretty astounding for him when he was in 1995 hired by the World Bank to  
**[0:45:43-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:45:43):**  document through film, he was a cameraman producer at the time, to document through  
**[0:45:49-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:45:49):**  film the restoration of this area the size of Belgium in what had been the breadbasket  
**[0:45:59-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:45:59):**  of China, this once fertile landscape.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:46:03):**  And I can't do it justice verbally, you must see it.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:46:09):**  I will link the documentary below because I think it's on YouTube.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:46:12):**  I even heard it's the size of France, but maybe the story starts expanding as it's  
**[0:46:16-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:46:16):**  bigger, but it's striking.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:46:18):**  The difference is day and night.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:46:21):**  Right.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:46:22):**  The Los Plateau is the size of France, but the area that was restored was the size of  
**[0:46:26-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:46:26):**  Belgium.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:46:27):**  Here, the geopolitics of land restoration.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:46:31):**  It's just striking that you had really dirt, just brown, empty soil that was no longer  
**[0:46:40-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:46:40):**  able to support any plants, that hardly any plants were growing at that point.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:46:46):**  And people were bringing their remaining goats up to the hillside just to kind of get the  
**[0:46:54-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:46:54):**  last little sprigs of growing green.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:46:58):**  And then after people were, the government had this huge, huge project in which people  
**[0:47:07-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:47:07):**  were paid to create terraces, to plant trees, to restore the landscape.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:47:17):**  They didn't use restorative grazing, but it would certainly be interesting to see what  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:47:21):**  happens when that gets brought in.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:47:24):**  But just over the several years, the land turned green and all these people that would  
**[0:47:33-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:47:33):**  have had to have been supported by the state were able to sustain themselves through their  
**[0:47:39-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:47:39):**  own growing on the land that had regained its fertility.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:47:46):**  It's really an extraordinary story.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:47:48):**  And I don't know why this story is not better known by the general public because it shows  
**[0:47:55-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:47:55):**  what can be done.  
**[0:47:57-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:47:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:47:58):**  And to put the impact investor had on, it was probably one of the best loans the World  
**[0:48:04-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:04):**  Bank has ever made because it kickstarted, of course, with all the support from local  
**[0:48:08-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:08):**  population, local communities and the state.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:11):**  But it made this, and luckily also they had some budget for John D. Louis.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:16):**  So we actually have the footage before and after and the process because otherwise we  
**[0:48:20-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:20):**  would have just had words.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:23):**  And now we actually have the visuals which make it so much more striking.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:27):**  Yes, it's really wonderful.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:29):**  And one thing that John Lu also talks about and something I think about a lot is that  
**[0:48:35-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:35):**  often when we look at our economic policies globally, the concern is how do we create  
**[0:48:41-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:41):**  jobs?  
**[0:48:42-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:42):**  And often it's discussed from a perspective of it's either the economy or the environment.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:50):**  Well, we need jobs.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:52):**  So even if these jobs involve extractive practices that perhaps are harmful to the environment,  
**[0:48:58-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:58):**  well, what are we going to do?  
**[0:48:59-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:48:59):**  We have no alternative.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:49:00):**  We have to put people to work.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:49:02):**  But there's a lot of work that needs to be done and can be done to restore our ecological  
**[0:49:10-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:49:10):**  systems.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:49:11):**  So why not put people to work to restore their environments?  
**[0:49:17-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:49:17):**  And then we have win, win, win because the ecology rebounds.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:49:23):**  The people are no longer at the margins of society being frustrated and not having an  
**[0:49:31-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:49:31):**  income.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:49:33):**  And also many areas of the world that have seen a lot of land degradation are areas where  
**[0:49:41-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:49:41):**  there are political tensions.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:49:45):**  So then that takes that pressure off too because populations where they are not able to sustainably  
**[0:49:55-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:49:55):**  manage their food systems, for example, these are people that are going to be flooding the  
**[0:50:03-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:50:03):**  cities and then the cities can no longer sustain their population.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:50:08):**  Then you get overflow and then you get these kind of mega city scenarios where you have  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:50:14):**  areas of slums and water problems and sanitation problems.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:50:19):**  And that's a recipe for unrest.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:50:25):**  No, definitely.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:50:26):**  I think that has been said many times, society that doesn't manage their land and their soil  
**[0:50:32-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:50:32):**  well, which will eventually go under.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:50:35):**  And I think we're running that risk.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:50:37):**  I think it's a great point too because I don't want to take too much of your time to also  
**[0:50:41-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:50:41):**  end this interview.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:50:42):**  I want to thank you so much.

**[0:50:57-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:50:57):**  to give people a good overview of what we've discussed here.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:51:01):**  And I will definitely keep checking in.

**[0:51:08-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:51:08):**  And I guess we'll find out in a year or two or so.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:51:12):**  Thank you so much.

**[0:51:27-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:51:27):**  actually cooling the planet.

**[0:52:37-0:52:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:52:37):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:52:41-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:52:41):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:52:45-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:52:45):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:52:49):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:52:51-0:52:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:52:51):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:52:55-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:52:55):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:53:00-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:53:00):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:53:05):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:53:07-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:53:07):**  How have we built our decision making framework?

**[0:54:28-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:54:28):**  so you don't have to write along.

**[0:54:52-0:54:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:54:52):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.

**[0:55:01-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:55:01):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:55:03):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:55:06):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:55:09):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/06/05/judith-d-schwartz/#t=0:55:11):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

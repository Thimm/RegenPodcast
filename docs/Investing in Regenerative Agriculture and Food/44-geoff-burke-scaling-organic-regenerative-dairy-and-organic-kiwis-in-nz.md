### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2018-12-18)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:14):**  You are listening to an interview where we talk about cows, kiwis and investing in New  Zealand where regenerative agriculture is really taking off.  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:24-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:24):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture.  Everything as if the planet mattered.  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:34-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:34):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:46-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:46):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:57-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:57):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:10):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:23):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:34):**  For more information please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  And now, without further ado, the interview.  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:44-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:44):**  So welcome to the podcast, I'm Koen van Zeyen, your host.  Today I'm joined by Joff Burke, founder of Agro Ecological all the way down in New  Zealand.  
**[0:01:51-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:51):**  This is an experiment where we try to dive deep into regenerative agriculture projects  on the ground and where we're also recording video as we go over the projects with Joff  today.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:00):**  Find all the links below in the description and please let us know what you think.  Agro Ecological is a New Zealand based impact investment manager and advisory firm focused  on farmland.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:09):**  Welcome Joff!  Morning, thank you and good evening.  Yeah, good evening, good morning.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:13):**  We're very far apart and there's a slight delay sometimes in the connection so it's  a good experiment to do.  For the first time actually on this podcast we have a video connection so it's going to  
**[0:02:23-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:23):**  be very interesting to see how that turns out.  But to start with a personal question, why and how did you end up in soil?  I mean you are from New Zealand where farming is a huge industry but still you could have  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:35):**  chosen many other career paths.  Yes, it's a good question.  I'll try and keep it short.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:40):**  We could be here all morning slash evening.  So essentially I'm from a farming background, I was brought up on a beef and sheep property.  My father always said that if we had had a restaurant we would have done it from paddock  
**[0:02:51-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:51):**  to plate.  So the family was involved with farming, livestock buying, butchery, meat exporting, so pretty  much everything else except restauranting.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:02):**  So I think it's kind of in you and you have an appetite for it.  And you know I went and studied it at university but I think like a lot of young men in the  1980s who were from farming backgrounds I ended up in investment banking because farming  
**[0:03:17-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:17):**  wasn't looking terribly clever.  I don't think in many places in the 80s, but I just got to that point in life where I think  I couldn't escape my genes and they started sort of vibrating particularly strongly and  
**[0:03:30-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:30):**  so I ended up pursuing particularly organic agriculture because I got interested, well  you know firstly because I was involved with futures and options I started to get interested  from the deal point of view because this organic stuff seemed a lot more expensive so therefore  
**[0:03:46-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:46):**  did that mean the farmers were making more money and you know having covered some of  it at university I could sort of intellectually get my head around it and that New Zealand  would probably be quite good at it.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:57):**  And so that's why I went back and did my postgraduate work back in New Zealand at Lincoln University  and then it sort of expanded from there so yeah that's trying to keep it short.  That's how we got into it.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:07):**  Thank you for that yeah because otherwise we could easily cover a full hour probably  on this easy.  So tell me agroecological what it is, what you do, who is we in that sense, how many  
**[0:04:19-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:19):**  people are you and why I mean you are from New Zealand but what's the reason of the base  in New Zealand?  Well we are in New Zealand now but I started off in the UK.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:30):**  I've spent probably 20 out of the last 25 years in the UK.  Because you lived there for a long time yeah?  Yeah that's right and worked at the organic research centre over there in Berkshire for  
**[0:04:39-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:39):**  a number of years so came back to New Zealand about five years ago.  So yeah I mean the name is because it kind of does what it says on the tin.  It's one of those those names that captures exactly what it's about and I think just what  
**[0:04:56-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:56):**  we wanted to try and achieve.  So we're a small team, there's just a handful of us but I think what we really wanted to  try and achieve was genuine transformation to drive change and one of the limiting factors  
**[0:05:07-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:07):**  around the perception of ecological agriculture or regenerative agriculture however you want  to term it is that it is less profitable and that people do it purely for philosophical  almost as religious reasons and you know my experience of having been on a lot of farms  
**[0:05:26-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:26):**  is that that that was wrong and particularly here in a New Zealand context that you had  the ability to create a more profitable system particularly if you could capture a premium  but even potentially without capturing that premium you had the ability to run a leaner  
**[0:05:40-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:40):**  more resilient system and so really it was about that.  It was about proving that we could create a system that was more environmentally positive  and that we would also drive good if not better financial returns and being able to demonstrate  
**[0:05:59-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:59):**  that through actually doing it.  So that's really sort of how it came about if you like.  And it's really based because we used to term organic a lot, we used to term regenerative  
**[0:06:08-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:08):**  a lot, for you it's really that's it's almost a step.  I mean organic is the official certifier but you cannot really be organic or the official  certification you cannot really be organic without being regenerative at least in your  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:22):**  experience and in your circumstances.  Yeah I mean that's how I view it.  I know there are different views around the world and people who say this sort of corporate  
**[0:06:29-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:29):**  organic and stuff like this but for me if you're doing it as well as you possibly can  then you're relying on ecological science or agroecological science.  So if you like being regenerative there's a byproduct of implementing sound robust best  
**[0:06:46-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:46):**  if you like agroecological management practice which QED makes you organic because all those  techniques are things that fall within the sort of the specifics of organic certification.  And really organic is just you know either way I view it is that organic is important  
**[0:07:05-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:05):**  because it's a stamp, it's independently audited and it gives consumers some comfort and that  drives the premium and that's important because it makes it more profitable and the more robust  and profitable it is and the more likely it is to drive more money into it and then see  
**[0:07:22-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:22):**  more organic agriculture being rolled out.  And you know it's been successful for 20-30 years but really hasn't expanded you know  perhaps as much as we we need it to thinking about climate change and other sort of environmental  
**[0:07:36-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:36):**  challenges and thinking about how much capital goes into agriculture as a whole and how much  of that goes into organic.  And research as well.  
**[0:07:46-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:46):**  Yeah exactly so there's still a fraction of capital flow going into you know this very  important or what we view as very important area in terms of creating good food, creating  good environmental outcomes, adapting to and dealing with climate change and the consequences  
**[0:08:01-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:01):**  of climate change.  Yeah I just wanted to bring up the next picture as you see the soil from underneath.  I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding in organic where many people see it as just  
**[0:08:12-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:12):**  replacing a few the chemical inputs you're using with some organic inputs probably getting  a lower yield if you do that like if you don't push the system as far as you're doing as  you're mentioning like you can really push it much further meaning that you get a lower  
**[0:08:27-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:27):**  yield which are usually the farms you see in ending up in research and thus you have  that tendency of saying we cannot feed the world with this because everybody has 20 or  30 percent lower yields which is not the case if you look at I mean it really depends where  
**[0:08:41-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:41):**  you take these examples plus there's only a fraction of the money went into research  so far meaning that we're really at the beginning I've seen farms that are maybe five or sometimes  even ten times better in yields and you're mentioning before and actually Nicole we should  
**[0:08:57-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:57):**  focus on profit per acre not use breaker but there where we haven't pushed the organic  system as far as we can in yields but also in profits and also in quality and we're just  at the beginning when it's a 20 30 year thing and compared to 50 or 60 maybe in in so it's  
**[0:09:12-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:12):**  there's an interesting discussion going on around that which makes me always feel a bit  uncomfortable as people say but can you actually feed the planet with that and I say yes if  you do it well but that's always the case if you do it in a bad way and you just replace  
**[0:09:26-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:26):**  a few things here and there of course you can't because you're just you're a bad farmer  basically yeah sorry that's not really a question but it's more a statement yeah no but it's  a good one because it does come up and then then we get into the whole debate well why  
**[0:09:40-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:40):**  is it that people are going hungry is it because we're not producing enough food or in the  West we've got sort of a high obesity level so clearly we're not lacking producing food  yeah it's about 2.5 billion with a business more about logistics and availability and  
**[0:09:55-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:55):**  poverty and these types of things so we we don't have a an inability to produce sufficient  food we absolutely do and from an organic perspective certainly the systems I know and  know well there is minimal yield penalty if any and certainly you know from our point  
**[0:10:12-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:12):**  of view from pastoral point of view from permanent crops such as kiwifruit there is no reason  why we wouldn't be in the top three five percent into purely for production certainly in terms  of profitability so yeah why is that because we're going to dive into dairy and kiwi in  
**[0:10:28-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:28):**  a minute but let's dive a bit into the nuts and bolts of not doing it the conventional  let's say conventional organic way just replacing a few inputs from chemical to organic and  then calling it a day no you're you're saying organic is meant to be and I've had this discussion  
**[0:10:43-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:43):**  before where people say the spirit of organic is constant tinkering and constant changing  and that's how they designed it now the certification in some places is very rigid but that wasn't  how the original pioneer started and so what's your let's say your take you can take a concrete  
**[0:10:59-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:59):**  example we might go into kiwis later on but if you want to take a complete example now  what would be your your definition of regenerative organic well you raised an interesting point  and this is one I we often talk about and that is that it's often perceived to be so  
**[0:11:15-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:15):**  organic agriculture is often perceived to be a case of substituting conventional inputs  for organic inputs and so that's fundamentally flawed that's not what it is and those are  usually the systems that fail and so for instance you'll see farmers who say organic doesn't  
**[0:11:30-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:30):**  work I've literally had that conversation with someone and but they would effectively  gone down there input substitution route so take the conventional input out put the organic  one in and so that you know that doesn't work and you know if someone was going to adopt  
**[0:11:45-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:45):**  that approach we could tell them beforehand before they even got started that it isn't  going to work because what you need to do is is redesign your system or if you like  even say put in place a new system and that's about management and it's about you know what's  
**[0:11:58-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:58):**  going on up in here just as much as it is what's going on down in the soil and the pasture  so that's and that's where you get success through creating that health that resilience  and so on in your system but it comes back to that management system it's not just take  
**[0:12:12-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:12):**  that thing out put that one in instead and that's crucial because generally most farmers  will think that's what it's about because that's how they've been educated to think  of farming is that then the most difficult piece like that changing the mind of the farmer  
**[0:12:25-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:25):**  or or nudging the mind of the farmer or yeah I would say certainly right now experience  in New Zealand is that there are a lot of people who are very interested more than I  have ever seen before there's much less of the sort of you know laughing into your hand  
**[0:12:40-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:40):**  or behind your back yeah yeah because people are recognizing that actually you know what  the current system isn't working there's a whole lot of regulation coming in around water  quality because water quality is not great as a consequence of intensive dairying and  
**[0:12:54-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:54):**  people in New Zealand don't like it which people anywhere don't like they're degrading  water quality and so you know that change is being driven that's not the only sort of  change but through that it's starting changing people think well how do I farm to be within  
**[0:13:08-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:08):**  the regulations to be if you like to have a social license to farm and then to also  make it profitable so I can continue farming with my family and perhaps pass it on to my  sons or daughters or whoever it is so those sort of questions are really quite in play  
**[0:13:23-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:23):**  strongly in New Zealand and so that means I am finding that I'm engaging with farmers  and talking to them about well let's develop the system let's develop that system what  are you thinking about doing and everyone that I'm talking with is saying yeah well  
**[0:13:38-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:38):**  we're interested in you know finding out more about organic how do we do it or you know  how do we make that system work so I would say right now and this is based on our New  Zealand experience that it's a really good time to be seeking to put those systems in  
**[0:13:53-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:53):**  place because I think farmers are very open to that but certainly that it's up here that's  the most important part of the system to convert that is the appetite for the genuine interest  in it is good and the great thing about New Zealand is that you get a lot of very capable  
**[0:14:08-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:08):**  farmers you know it's a big sector here it's a major sector so capable young men and women  go into the sector we'd probably like to see more going in but there's plenty out there  and what's interesting is that if you like the most motivated ones are the ones who are  
**[0:14:23-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:23):**  interested in pursuing this more sustainable line and you know they have more of an appetite  for it and that's good because it does require you to be ahead of the curve a little bit  you know to be in sort of the top 10 20 percent of conventional operators that those are the  
**[0:14:39-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:39):**  guys who are going to make it make it work and it puts you aside a bit in your communities  yeah yeah how big is the farming industry and you mentioned before in a conversation  we had it's basically I mean you never have to put the animals inside it has the perfect  
**[0:14:54-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:54):**  climate is there changing a lot in the climate as well is that like a risk for the next 20  30 years remarkably benign climate you know we're very lucky with our climate so animals  can be outside grazing all year round to some extent that does depend on your your soil  
**[0:15:11-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:15:11):**  but there are not large parts of New Zealand turning on a not large farming parts that  are under snow pretty much nowhere in the North Island will be getting snow in the farm  except up on the peaks the hills or something but but it's not it's not like northern Europe  
**[0:15:27-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:15:27):**  or or North America it just doesn't and grass grass will grow all year round in large areas  of the country it might slow down or stop in some places in sort of July you know the  middle of winter but otherwise you know you keep growing so you know to compensate for  
**[0:15:43-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:15:43):**  that lack of pasture growth you're far you harvest if you harvest in your peak season  and you feed it out yeah so we've got a fantastic climate we've also got rain and good soils  and sunshine so we have sunshine we have heat units we have water we have that ability to  
**[0:16:02-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:02):**  go outside all year round that ability to grow things is is the basis of the country's  economy really you know there's a certain amount of tourism which is pretty important  particularly when sort of Lord of the Rings and films like that get made and people come  
**[0:16:15-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:15):**  down and visit but yeah it's really about food production and that comes back to the  climate the quality of the climate we have which is is a real blessing and it's almost  all export I assume yeah look there's four million people in this country and I think  
**[0:16:29-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:29):**  we produce enough food so I've heard various sort of measures but you know sort of 40 50  60 million so I think literally 95 percent of what New Zealand produces is exported so  in the context of the global economy from an agriculture point of view we're extremely  
**[0:16:44-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:44):**  important dairy I think we're around one third of globally traded dairy product I think we're  the biggest exporter of kiwifruit more zest free at least is the biggest export of kiwifruit  the New Zealand kiwifruit marketer lamb with a number one exporter of lamb so and apples  
**[0:17:03-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:03):**  we're not number one but we're very big from again from an export point of view just because  you know pretty much everything we produce whatever it is will be going overseas and  just on this slide one thing I always like to ask measurable environmental performance  
**[0:17:17-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:17):**  what are you measuring what would you like to measure because it's not always the same  thing and what our customers asking what our investors asking you're working with what's  your experience being your experience on the measurement part okay so those are some interesting  
**[0:17:29-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:29):**  questions so that there's been a rise in impact investment but investors we are talking to  seldom and I'm like I think I can only think of one but they're seldom articulating we  need these particular metrics we need to see that you're measuring this pretty much everyone  
**[0:17:46-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:46):**  we talked to are super happy with the approach we're taking and and this kind of a case of  or we say we're going to measure these things and they go well that's that sounds fantastic  so and I think I think it's so juxtaposed with what they're otherwise seeing so there's  
**[0:18:02-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:02):**  such a sort of a separation between if you like the norm and what we're doing so in terms  of what we would like to measure well some of them are relatively straightforward to  do and that's biodiversity is a fairly obvious one some are very important but much more  
**[0:18:15-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:15):**  technically difficult to do which is water quality but in doing that there are mechanisms  you can use and then also we're looking to work with regulators and certain catchments  who are monitoring water quality and to do that over time you know some of these things  
**[0:18:31-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:31):**  are not quick fixes but we're quite keen to see how we can record that that change and  how that happens at sort of a micro level so at the farm level and then also in the  wider catchment level particularly when you if you start to get multiple farms under under  
**[0:18:46-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:46):**  management then it'd be interesting to see how you can identify those those differences  but otherwise it becomes things such as you know you talk about putting particular environmental  mitigations or management actions in place that you say are going to make a difference  
**[0:19:01-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:01):**  so the first thing would be to do to measure is that well have you actually done those  things that you said you were going to do and to some extent you know science hasn't  caught up with good management practice so an example of that would be if you sow a really  
**[0:19:14-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:14):**  diverse mixture pasture you know some of that's very deep rooting and so you're better holding  on to nutrient in that soil then if you've just got really very short rooted grasses  well that isn't picked up for instance in New Zealand in the nutrient monitoring system  
**[0:19:30-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:30):**  so you get no benefit out of having that pasture system versus having say a very short rooted  ryegrass so the science to some extent has to catch up in terms of its ability to measure  those differences but you know nonetheless those are the sort of things we're putting  
**[0:19:44-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:44):**  in place because we know they make a difference from a lot of different points of view you  know health of the animals and performance as well as retaining nutrient and so on and  so forth so.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:55):**  Are you measuring carbon like your your big neighbour Australia is doing as there is there  is a sort of a market there but I don't know the situation that well in your part of the  world.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:06):**  We're ranking up again actually and probably literally the last couple of weeks carbon  has become much more of a topic with farmers that I'm talking to so there is a billion  trees program as it's called here in New Zealand where the government is encouraging people  
**[0:20:19-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:19):**  to get out there and plant trees and you may be familiar with manuka honey you probably  had on your toast this morning and so there's an opportunity to plant more of that manuka  and make oil and honey and also lock up some carbon so it's a really interesting area it's  
**[0:20:38-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:38):**  just growing and super interested in that because I think you know more silver pastoral  type systems something that is of interest to us and it totally links in with that so  and they look be great to be able to measure that and create more income and yeah so I  
**[0:20:56-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:56):**  think that's something that you will see increasing it's something we will pursue on farm you  know without.  Yeah it's probably one of the fastest ways as well to rebuild soil carbon levels as well.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:07):**  Absolutely and trees grow super fast in this country you know something that might take  60 80 years and say the UK will grow here in about 2025 so it's you know dramatically  different as I said the warm width just makes such a difference.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:22):**  Great you're one of the biggest players as a country I mean one of your marketing the  marketing company that most people when they eat a kiwi at least one in two or something  comes from from New Zealand why are you pushing for a regenerative organic and why is it such  
**[0:21:37-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:37):**  an interesting development at the moment in New Zealand?  So there's the pure market interest so you attract a premium for being organic and the  market is growing you know sharply North America and Asia so that that's the exciting dollar  
**[0:21:53-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:53):**  driven end of it if you like and which is quite compelling and that there is a marked  shortage of supply and the ability to change that rapidly in a short space of time just  simply doesn't exist so that that's very compelling.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:22:08):**  The second thing from a production point of view is that we have identified a sort of  unique agronomic advantage in a particular location and it's connected to how kiwifruit  grow or how they are made to grow and essentially kiwifruit need to have winter chilling so  
**[0:22:28-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:22:28):**  they need to be.  And that means winter not chilling chilling in a big warehouse or something.  No that's right not in your fridge no no don't put them in your fridge no it means you know  
**[0:22:39-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:22:39):**  you need cold winter and that stimulates bud break so growth and yield which obviously  means you get more fruit so that's very important and there is a synthetic input used conventionally  to stimulate that activity which is not permitted organically and that's a factor in the biggest  
**[0:23:01-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:01):**  kiwifruit producing region in New Zealand where there is a bit of a lack of winter chilling  and they have to use that and so the absence of that in an organic system in that region  means you tend to get a yield penalty.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:15):**  Basically meaning sorry to summarize that the region where most of the kiwis are grown  now in New Zealand either due to climate change or in general doesn't have that cold winter  or doesn't have the cold winter anymore meaning they have to use a strong chemical or a chemical  
**[0:23:31-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:31):**  substance to fake the winter and meaning they cannot really switch to organic tomorrow because  they would not be able to use that substance thus won't have the same yields as before.  Correct yeah so guys do guys do convert and you know eventually get there but you will  
**[0:23:50-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:50):**  the average yield is lower.  So you chose to be somewhere else I mean that's the target you chose a region where it does  get cold.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:58):**  Yeah look there's no question that the region that we have identified is better for growing  organic kiwifruit there's just no doubt and it's because of that extra winter chilling  because actually in the summer the region I'm talking about has higher heat units so  
**[0:24:14-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:14):**  it's kind of a double whammy you're getting better winter chilling but then you're getting  more heat through the summer.  So it's significant it essentially means you can deliver conventional type yields but with  
**[0:24:26-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:26):**  the organic premium on top.  And your costs are lower as well are your inputs in kiwi production is that a big difference  or?  
**[0:24:34-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:34):**  Well your cost of license is cheaper and your production is high value.  The actual operating cost is similar so that is not a marked difference between the two  it'll depend on what you're specifically doing with your management system.  
**[0:24:51-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:51):**  We think there is some scope to be lower in cost of production if you can set the system  up right and that's what's attractive one of the attractive things about doing a bareland  development and if you're actually going to secure gold organic license you actually have  
**[0:25:07-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:07):**  to have a bareland development.  What does that mean?  So you take existing kiwifruit in the ground and cut across to gold under an organic system  
**[0:25:17-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:17):**  it has to be bareland development.  What does that development you mentioned a specific type BNL development what does that  mean?  
**[0:25:25-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:25):**  So I'm really just meaning yeah you know literally bareland.  So really from the ground up starting from zero.  How long does it take to before the vines are not doing grapes but doing kiwifruits?  
**[0:25:38-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:38):**  Yeah so you'll get a harvest in year three it won't be a really proper commercial harvest  you'll get a more commercial type harvest in year four you'd still expect to increase  from that point on for a few years but yeah.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:53):**  And when does it mature or is there a certain moment it goes down again?  It doesn't go down they sort of go on forever they're absolute monsters kiwifruit they're  just beasts.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:03):**  So they can be a little susceptible to wet feet and to wind but the way you develop them  you have sort of nets and shelter and so on and so forth so they're very well protected  from wind and you it's obviously important to find out about your soils that they're  
**[0:26:17-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:17):**  going into that they're free draining you know fertile and free draining because wet  feet are not good for kiwifruit but if you have those variables in place as I say they  are monsters.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:25):**  And in terms of soil what's their impact on the soil is there fertilizer necessary what  kind of are you doing any intercropping is it a monoculture plant or what how does the  kiwifruit plant feel or vine feels happy?  
**[0:26:42-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:42):**  Yeah so obviously there's largely a monoculture because it's a permanent crop but within that  you know we look at doing a lot of different things in between the rows you can sow you  know legume like clover and then you go through and cut it and have it so that it shoots out  
**[0:27:00-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:00):**  of the mower under the vines so you're getting a mulch which is obviously got nitrogen in  it you can also plant plants that will attract beneficial insects so buckwheat and and faecida  and things like that so there are different things you can do and one of the things we're  
**[0:27:15-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:15):**  very interested in doing which which would be quite new and innovative is to plant a  habitat around the outside so it acts as shelter but also as a habitat for beneficial insects  to sort of create that reservoir if you like of beneficial biodiversity and we're quite  
**[0:27:36-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:36):**  interested in doing that and because kiwifruit aren't necessarily the sexiest plants for  pollinators so you need to do your best to create an environment where pollinators are  motivated to to stay there and spend some time there so that's part of what we we seek  
**[0:27:52-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:52):**  to do with the system as well which isn't generally otherwise done as a deliberate action  in setting up the system but that's what I was talking about in terms of you know setting  up a sort of a purpose-built system for organic performance for organic production.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:07):**  And in terms of the structure obviously without giving investment advice which is not what  we're doing but what are you looking I mean you're looking to develop a farm basically  from the ground up you have an interesting team here what's in terms of the invest store  
**[0:28:21-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:21):**  putting my invest store head on what's in terms of the invest impact investment what  what's the structure looking for is this a one-off thing are you going to do multiple  what do you see if we talk in a few years from now and the first one has his first semi-commercial  
**[0:28:36-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:36):**  harvest where what would you be looking at?  Yeah I think it's interesting because it's it's not easy to deploy big chunks of capital  into into kiwifruit the average size of a kiwifruit orchard in New Zealand is something  
**[0:28:49-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:49):**  like 2.8 or 3 hectares for a gold orchard it's very small you know that that said one  of the developments we're looking at is would be about 15 hectares and the canopy would  actually be quite large in the particular region we're I think going to be the second  
**[0:29:04-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:04):**  largest individual holding so.  And canopy here just to be clear means canopy of trees or canopy of nets?  Yeah so it's canopy means if you like the area that's got vines growing okay and so  
**[0:29:18-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:18):**  we think of it as as a netted area because we have nets over the top but basically canopy  is really referring to the kiwifruit so where you can see all those sort of leaves because  if you're standing under kiwifruit in the sort of the peak of the season as it were  
**[0:29:32-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:32):**  there's not a lot of light coming through you know it's quite sort of a lot darker.  And the nets you put for birds or what's the purpose of the nets?  Wind, wind is the biggest thing it's a bit of a help with birds obviously but primarily  
**[0:29:46-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:46):**  it's wind.  And would it be because I've seen systems on I think Propagate Ventures was sharing  a system for I remember it was apples or something but in I think in Argentina where they planted  
**[0:30:00-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:00):**  a lot of very high trees around certain apple farms so they basically caught the wind so  they created nets but on the side and made of trees and they've been doing that for 20  or 30 I think even much longer without netting it basically they managed to slow down the  
**[0:30:15-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:15):**  wind that came through their orchards because it was such a probably the same with kiwis  it's such a threat but not from above but basically on the side.  Historically they've had trees around them but some of the first trees they used to plant  
**[0:30:28-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:28):**  they found they were they were havens for a pest the pest really loved to live on that  tree and then they'd sort of jump into the orchard so that wasn't quite so successful.  So yeah you know they've learned a lot more about that.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:41):**  Nets are extremely effective as I say we will utilize trees as well or perhaps you know  shrubs more people hate to plant trees but ones that will create habitat you know losing  using a lot of native plants and so on and so forth.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:59):**  So just sorry there was this this side just to come back to the structure you'll be doing  a one-off for now is it I mean depending on that you'll be doing more?  Yeah that's right at the moment we've got we've got a one-off project but there are  
**[0:31:10-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:10):**  other opportunities coming up in the pipeline as I say look you're not going to deploy big  institutional type amounts of money into kiwifruit in New Zealand.  So if you are thinking the type of investor who might look at this it might be you know  
**[0:31:25-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:25):**  high net worths and family offices and those types of investors because yeah look one or  two projects but there will be the opportunity over time I imagine given what we're seeing  that's our expectation that there will be other other assets come up.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:40):**  But from an offshore capital point of view bare land development works as well as well  as it does from the production sort of point of view and the license point of view and  that's because you have a the overseas investment office to go through here in New Zealand.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:56):**  So that's a process and there are boxes that have to be ticked so of course you're adding  a lot of value to land if you develop land from bare land into kiwifruit.  Yeah because currently the land is used for either cattle or it's bare land right?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:12):**  Yeah well the sort of land we're looking at is it's either grazing it's got animals grazing  on it or it's being cropped for animal feed.  Other properties they might be doing some annual cropping you know possibly onions or  
**[0:32:25-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:25):**  something like that but whatever it is you're doing you're still taking it and turning it  into a much higher value product or land use while you're turning it to kiwifruit.  Great I think we're going to switch to a much much bigger project you're working on which  
**[0:32:41-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:41):**  is actually project regeneration which obviously caught my attention so let's go to that.  So you mentioned dairy a couple of times and we mentioned dairy actually a couple of times  and we have a nice overview of a number of dairy operations here.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:57):**  It's a huge industry in New Zealand it's a big part of your economy I mean you're the  30% of all dairy exported in the world probably comes from your place in the world.  What are the main issues?  
**[0:33:09-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:09):**  Why is this such an interesting space for let's say an impact investor to get involved  and why are you focusing on the dairy industry?  I think there's probably a couple reasons why we're focusing on dairy.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:23):**  One is it's the biggest industry in the agricultural sector in New Zealand and by some way.  The second thing would be that it has a reputation for being dirty and polluting.  As we can see in this river here.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:37):**  Yeah dairy is referred to as dirty dairying and there has been a dramatic fall in water  quality in these sort of catchments where dairy intensification has increased over in  a relatively short period of time.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:55):**  You know we're not talking sort of 50 years we're talking more like sort of 20 years and  so that is becoming socially unacceptable.  Yeah I was just going to switch to the slide where you share a bit more about that like  
**[0:34:07-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:07):**  peak cows I think the first time I've seen that.  That's right.  Yeah so that some of those headlines you know this is coming from the Minister of the Environment  
**[0:34:17-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:17):**  and the Minister for Primary Industries or for Agriculture in effect.  So they're saying you know we pretty much think we've reached peak cow.  So basically there's this mood of change if you like and it's being brought about also  
**[0:34:30-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:30):**  by actual regulation so nutrient loads are being kept and so that the change is coming  which is a good thing.  A lot of farmers don't think it is but we saw that that was created an opportunity because  
**[0:34:42-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:42):**  you know where someone sees I know it's all changing and it's bad we'll have to leave  or we see opportunity in that rather than something to run away from and the opportunity  is to go and acquire farms transform those into regenerative systems that are generating  
**[0:35:01-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:01):**  better environmental outcomes but also you know good financial outcomes and make also  make make people sort of take a different view on farming that it doesn't have to be  about just making dollars and instead of you know abusing the environment that actually  
**[0:35:19-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:19):**  we can we can make that environmental outcome sort of better we can deliver better biodiversity  we can improve water quality from where it is now and still make money and make you know  milk that is high value so create better financial outcomes as well as environmental.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:35):**  You know I think it's you know intellectually we reject that concept that there is a trade-off  between environment and profitability we see the two actually as linked you do a better  job of the environmental and you will achieve a better outcome on the financial and frankly  
**[0:35:51-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:51):**  it has to happen that the sort of the environmental consequence is no longer something that can  just be swept aside or or you know classified as someone else's problem you know that has  to be deliberately confronted and regulators are seeking to confront and deal with it and  
**[0:36:09-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:09):**  that's the environment we go into and so that's why it's a good time in our view to be looking  at dairy.  Yeah so basically you're you're going in and and is it going to be one watershed or one  
**[0:36:22-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:22):**  region where because obviously if you're all sharing the same river with all the farmers  in a region maybe the farm you pick or that's for sale you buy you turn into beyond organic  or organic regenerative are you figuring out also which farm to pick to have the most impact  
**[0:36:39-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:39):**  on on that river or is that something you're you're thinking about how to have that ecosystem  or watershed level thinking where are those I would almost I call it in the show every  time acupuncture points where you can have the most potential impact is that something  
**[0:36:54-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:54):**  you're thinking of?  Yeah absolutely it is and certainly with the project we're looking at the moment it's it's  very much focused on a catchment now obviously there are neighbouring catchments that you  
**[0:37:04-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:04):**  can you can look to as well but it is focused on a particular catchment and then you know  you know we're looking to working closely with those who have been studying those those  areas you know particularly the regulators I'm thinking have been recording a lot of  
**[0:37:21-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:21):**  information and will have very good insight as to you know those key areas but you know  certainly we're looking to so we target farms for instance that will have waterways going  through them which isn't actually that challenging to find necessarily in New Zealand and particularly  
**[0:37:36-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:36):**  in this particular catchment so there's a real opportunity to make a difference there  but that kind of insight is really useful and valuable and I think the way we we will  do that in this situation is through that that sort of collective approach so working  
**[0:37:51-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:51):**  in with other stakeholders in the catchments and that's the great thing at the moment their  appetite to make a difference and how we go about doing that and historically it's always  sort of been a bit of a stick oh you must stop doing this and stop doing that and you  
**[0:38:04-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:04):**  know that's achieved a certain amount but this becomes I think a much more powerful  sort of driver of change and deliverer of improved outcomes and so yeah but it's a really  look it's a really good question but we do try and specifically target areas and even  
**[0:38:21-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:21):**  farms that will have a an above the line degree of improvement and impact.  And in terms of let's say you buy a farm and I would see the first day or the day before  you bought it and five years later what are the main differences apart from getting your  
**[0:38:39-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:39):**  organic certification what would I see as main differences are different grazing and  are going to be trees are the cows looking different or the different types of cows is  there what's the if a farmer would visit because I obviously don't see too many differences  
**[0:38:52-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:52):**  I mean I would see a tree but if a farmer would visit and what would he or she see in  in like a couple of years what would be like whoa okay that I didn't expect or that that's  completely different from what I know.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:03):**  Cows will have really big smiles on their faces can they just they'll be much happier  you'll see that but no and look in reality you will notice dramatically different looking  pasture and the number of species in that pasture.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:16):**  Going from what to what what's your goal and what are they now?  Well generally you'll be going from potentially just pure rye grass or rye grass with a little  bit of white clover to so let's say two varieties to something that might have 15 or 20 different  
**[0:39:30-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:30):**  species in it so a variety of clovers maybe some lucer there's for trefoil chicory plantain.  You plant that in or it comes back naturally?  Yeah yeah so you you have a rotation so you don't go in year one and sort of you know  
**[0:39:47-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:47):**  plow up everything and sow new grass otherwise you're going to be struggling to feed your  animals but you'll have a system of renewal and you might accelerate that a little bit  you might increase it a little bit but broadly you will operate on that rotation of renewal  
**[0:40:00-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:00):**  to bring the new pasture in and you'll also find to an extent that once you have a level  of that new pasture in the cows will also start to help spread it around the farm.  Whatever livestock system you have that would happen so yeah that's how you make it sort  
**[0:40:15-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:15):**  of work so that's something you will notice is a difference.  Trees you'll see a lot more trees on farms that that we're operating and that might be  natives up into scrappy steep gullies that aren't terribly productive could be plantations  
**[0:40:30-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:30):**  in those areas could be more of a silver pastoral type system where you have rows of whatever  it might be could be apple trees could be timber trees could be nut trees in paddocks.  Is that something that happens already a lot?  
**[0:40:43-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:43):**  Is that something you see in New Zealand or that's pretty pretty new because the pictures  I've seen the picture you shared in the presentation there there's hardly a tree inside.  Yeah yeah no now particularly New Zealand dairy farms historically it's always been  
**[0:40:56-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:56):**  seen that if you had a tree it meant it was growing somewhere that couldn't grow grass  so you had to get rid of the tree so you could grow more grass.  The idea of sort of shelter for the animals and you know this I think just didn't come  
**[0:41:07-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:07):**  into the equation.  That's starting to change and so people are starting to sort of see trees maybe as being  an asset which obviously they are so but you will see a lot more trees on farms and in  
**[0:41:19-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:19):**  ways that you wouldn't normally expect to see trees on farms as well so I mean people  will talk about riparian planting in New Zealand but we will do that and to a high level and  I don't just mean lots of it but in terms of thinking about the species we are putting  
**[0:41:35-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:35):**  in place and what else are they doing apart from retaining nutrient because there's only  so much they're doing at that point you know when you're a meter or two away from the river  there's only so much they're doing but so well what else what are the other benefits  
**[0:41:48-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:48):**  we're getting out of out of those sort of systems and are there other things we can  plant so you know you know we've talked in the past you know about medicinal type plantings  so the animals can self-medicate and other sources of fodder as well as the shelter and  
**[0:42:03-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:03):**  you know just rubbing posts you know this type of thing so there's you know trees are  pretty cool things and there are a lot of ways we can use them there's a real drive  to see more trees being planted in this country and there's the carbon factor and the ability  
**[0:42:15-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:15):**  to to drive you know more income out of the use of trees as well so there's there's a  lot of compelling reasons and that's a definite way you're going to see a physical difference  on the farm look another way might be that you change the breed of livestock you're dealing  
**[0:42:29-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:29):**  with so I don't mean radically changing it from from dairy cows to something else but  I mean the breed of cow you're utilizing you may change in order to have a more or better  adapted animal for an organic system so one that's quite robust produces off fodder resilient  
**[0:42:46-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:46):**  cows easily and all those sort of good qualities that that you want in an organic system and  in terms of the yeah no no I we call them what is the Botox cows or whatever you you  give them yeah they're they probably won't survive very well in a in a few more trees  
**[0:43:06-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:06):**  some fodder and some herbal plants they wouldn't know what to do with that and in terms of  the other end on the sales part I mean I read here your I mean there are two main companies  one cooperative and the other not you can sell to is there any direct market is there  
**[0:43:20-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:20):**  any margins apart from the organic premium you're taking your you're thinking about like  at some point is there going to be a more farm to fork to come back to to your family's  business previously is there more of a direct link is there something that you can play  
**[0:43:34-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:34):**  with in in New Zealand or because it's export you have to go through these big players because  otherwise you can't yeah it's I mean it's a great idea and one I always loved in the  in the UK but the reality is we just don't have the population here I think if you're  
**[0:43:51-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:51):**  very close to a significant town and particularly if you're close to a tourist type town in  New Zealand then that can work I think and if you're a you know a relatively small smaller  artisan type type thing but the scale of farms we're talking about here are quite you know  
**[0:44:09-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:09):**  these are pretty big farms these are 800 cow type farms so the locals have got to drink  a lot of that milk and to make it stay up and also to pay a pretty good price for it  as well so reality is the nature of New Zealand is such that it's always going to be focused  
**[0:44:25-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:25):**  on on the export and you know I think that's important so you're going to be more of a  price taker than than a price giver because yes I mean to an extent with the processor  we are talking and this is more of a now a North Island conversation than South Island  
**[0:44:42-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:42):**  and our focus tends to be South Island but there are some organizations in the North  Island who are looking to capture much more of that value through higher value products  and to get that back to the farmer so we have talked to the process in the South Island  
**[0:44:59-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:59):**  about that and I think there is a degree of appetite around creating a bit of share in  the value that that is available to to high because if you're creating great absolutely  great milk with different protein levels different nutrient levels and much happier cows that  
**[0:45:15-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:45:15):**  hopefully give much better milk it's almost a shame if that value is taken either by the  processor or then by the marketing company that yeah well if that's the case then that's  the case I mean there's no not too much you can do about it but you see a lot of other  
**[0:45:29-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:45:29):**  regenerative farmers that at some point maybe they are into grain they start a mill or at  some point they try to capture or they with a few others they start a processor themselves  but I haven't seen anything honestly in dairy on that thing and obviously you have a very  
**[0:45:45-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:45:45):**  particular logistical situation as you export most of it so there's a difference there but  it you can see that movement in a lot of places but maybe it's too difficult for you at the  moment I do think there's the opportunity to do that and I think we'll probably start  
**[0:46:02-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:02):**  to see that increase because I know that there is capital that is interested in much more  of that vertical integration of that extending through the value chain and not just owning  the say the farming assets and producing the milk but in sort of processing it and then  
**[0:46:18-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:18):**  putting it into supermarkets in Asia or into North America or wherever it might be and  the I mean it's a it's a good thing for us to look to do or to at least capture that  because the the value available through an organic product is you know really really  
**[0:46:36-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:36):**  very very significant there's a lot of margin in there to be to be captured and for farmers  to be rewarded and so that it's a compelling prospect for us to sort of you know work to  just sort of capture more of that.  
**[0:46:52-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:52):**  And in terms of structure this is very very different from the Kiwi structure we discussed  previously this is much bigger opportunity your plan is to buy many farms and to really  build a portfolio which also makes sense for potential institutional investors right that's  
**[0:47:06-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:06):**  the what I read at least through through these slides.  Yeah yeah well look the the opportunity because of market conditions at the moment because  of size of individual farms because of the size of the market is such that you can deploy  
**[0:47:20-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:20):**  a lot of capital and in quite good time into dairying in New Zealand.  I think it's pretty much exclusively into this kind of transformational regenerative  approach I think if you're offshore capital you will struggle to deploy capital into conventional.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:38):**  Why is that?  The overseas investment office.  They have to basically agree on every investment and they're much more likely to go for this  
**[0:47:47-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:47):**  type?  Yeah it's four hectares and there aren't too many dairy farms in New Zealand smaller than  four hectares so yeah you know and just to give you an idea look we're talking about  
**[0:47:56-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:56):**  as I said 800 cow type farms you know 15 and a half million dollars to buy the farm the  cows and everything else you need so you know these are not small assets but it's quite  a compelling sort of setup the nature of the market because of availability and because  
**[0:48:15-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:48:15):**  of valuations because of the nature of the organic market and because of some of these  pressures coming on through regulation the aging farmer population the high levels of  debt at the farm gate you know there are a lot of reasons which which make it very interesting  
**[0:48:30-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:48:30):**  to look at at the moment and as I say from that regenerative if that's your strategy  if that's not your strategy then I think you really need to sort of move on look at other  things or other places but if you're adopting a regenerative approach and it's it's measurable  
**[0:48:47-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:48:47):**  and articulate and articulated and one that is genuinely inclusive with stakeholders in  those catchments and then I think it becomes far more plausible or it becomes an executable  sort of strategy as opposed to one that is at its time.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:05):**  I think it's interesting as it's such a specific case it's mostly export and it seems to be  mostly potential investments coming from overseas so it's a very particular case when you look  at the global agriculture market and that makes it but you've always had that interaction  
**[0:49:23-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:23):**  it's always been for export and I think lots of the money I think we had a discussion previously  as well and the local impact investing sector which doesn't really exist yet or starting  to emerge but it's mostly Australia mostly further away and that's actually how we got  
**[0:49:37-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:37):**  connected as well so that's very interesting.  New Zealand is small you know there's four million people four and a half million people  and so that means there's a small number of large investors very small the capital isn't  
**[0:49:52-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:52):**  that big so to rely on on domestic capital alone to drive impact type outcomes it's starting  at a small level to happen that's for sure but relative to offshore capital then well  there's no comparison.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:04):**  So yeah so I stopped the sharing and I would like to end with a final question I see that  actually time has flown okay if you could wave your your magic wand and tomorrow morning  we wake up or in a few hours because in your case it's already evening what would you like  
**[0:50:19-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:19):**  to change in the ag or regenerative ag and the impact investing space what would be your  point to that what would wake up tomorrow and think ah Jeff changed something.  Yeah I would like to see a lot more capital being deployed into the regenerative ag sector  
**[0:50:38-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:38):**  and into making change happen because there is a lot of discussion about this there's  a lot of ESG reports produced there's a lot of even media coverage but in terms of the  actual activity on the ground I mean I think I literally know all the regenerative ag investment  
**[0:50:59-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:59):**  guys in the Western world and I could probably have them over for a dinner party you know  there might be one I'm missing out or two but you know two or three of those four of  those guys and that's about all there is you know I know them extremely well they're all  
**[0:51:12-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:12):**  great guys yeah all girls of course yeah the ones I know all actually are guys but there  might be girls out there as well.  Which is an issue on my show I have to be honest yeah I want much more gender diversity  
**[0:51:23-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:23):**  because in the impact investing space it's much more balanced but somehow when as soon  as you get to agriculture it loses that gender balance completely which is really annoying  so anybody listening or watching and knows any great people to interview please think  
**[0:51:38-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:38):**  about gender balance because I need that much better so if you scroll down on the soundcloud  list it's it's quite embarrassing actually but so you would change that but how would  you do that what would be the main.  
**[0:51:49-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:49):**  As I say this is money going into traditional conventional agriculture that is is part of  the problem not part of the solution and where there's some very capable people doing great  things in the regenerative space and it would be good to see those guys being rewarded for  
**[0:52:06-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:52:06):**  their their vision and their passion and their ability to to make you know change happen.  And what do you think is the how could we do that I mean the magic wand is probably  not going to work I'm sorry to to to bust that bubble but how would be what would be  
**[0:52:22-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:52:22):**  one thing to wake up investors for soil or to even maybe the other part to to see the  risks they're putting to work now while while they're investing in conventional chemical  agriculture what would you think is the main leverage point we have.  
**[0:52:39-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:52:39):**  Well yeah that's a lot of our yeah yeah days and I think all you can do is is talk to to  facts to what you know to describe the sort of the situation and then you need to find  that the right people so you need to find the people who will be willing to support  
**[0:53:00-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:00):**  that and to whom it is important to support and I think that's increasing I think so particularly  out of northern Europe or say out of families who are getting that generational change these  types of things are becoming important and so they become less of a nice to have and  
**[0:53:18-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:18):**  more of an essential to have and I think that's I'm hoping that's where we'll start to see  some sort of change being driven through through that process but but otherwise it's you know  it is challenging it becomes a case of you know articulating the story over and over  
**[0:53:37-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:37):**  again finding people who understand it you know and who have a have a desire to pursue  it whether that desire is based on motivation around wanting to drive environmental change  or whether it's just recognition that hey this is a really good idea and there's this  
**[0:53:53-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:53):**  big trend sort of moving this way in the world anyway so we might as well get on board because  we could make some money you know my view is if people want to pursue it because they  just want to make money well that's great because it's still doing the right thing and  
**[0:54:05-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:05):**  I hope that they then like the all the other sort of stuff as well but yeah I just you  know those are the kinds of things that I think are driving the change well that's what  we need to see more of yeah I completely agree it's a it really goes against many things  
**[0:54:21-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:21):**  that we we've learned and seen in agriculture and and to question that or saying we can  go much further than that is really difficult for people to get into their head now I've  seen an organic farm and the farmers really struggling so I know that organic farmers  
**[0:54:35-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:35):**  are struggling and and we're never going to feed the world with that it's like yeah but  I've seen others and so that's a that's it's a very very difficult narrative to get through  but the narrative is very strong and very good and I think with with the regulations  
**[0:54:48-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:48):**  that are happening it's a very interesting point in New Zealand that the outside pressure  is going to be stronger and there is a huge pull factor because the export market is is  so interested in this stuff so that that hopefully it's like an inflection point so I want to  
**[0:55:00-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:55:00):**  thank you so much for your time it was great to learn more on New Zealand more on kiwifruits  that I never knew before more on on dairy and and of course to see like quite a particular  but very interesting agriculture situation and impact investing situation where both  
**[0:55:14-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:55:14):**  the export is the key driver but also the import or the investment coming from overseas  so you have those two pulling points basically working together so it's a it was great spending  your evening thank you so much for taking the time this Monday evening and I hope to  
**[0:55:30-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:55:30):**  check in with you soon again and learn much more on other projects you're working on great  well it's been a pleasure talking with you current and so nice to catch up and I hope  to speak again soon and thank you for being part of this experiment so yeah it's been

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course, or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:13):**  This interview is a check-in interview with Eric Jackson of Pipeline Foods, and we dive  deep into transition finance, how to finance farmers and get many, many more row crop acres  into organic and eventually regenerative production.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:28):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  the planet mattered.  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:38-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:38):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:50):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat, and it's time that we as investors, big and small  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:06):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job, and I  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:18):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:32):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you, and if you have the means, I invite you to  support me and make this happen.  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:44):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  Enjoy.  Welcome to a new episode.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:49):**  I'm Koen Vossain, your host, and today I have the great pleasure to have Eric Jackson back  on the podcast.  I've interviewed him in June, 2018, so almost a year ago.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:57):**  And although we talked for over an hour, we had so much more to cover.  I will link the earlier interview in the show notes below.  Eric is the founder and CEO of Pipeline Foods, who after a career in conventional chemical  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:07):**  agriculture and software could retire, but decided to build the missing link in organic  broad acre row crops, mainly corn and soy.  Welcome back, Eric.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:16):**  Thank you, Koen.  It's a pleasure to be back with you after, as you pointed out, almost a year.  It's been a busy year for us here at Pipeline Foods.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:25):**  We've continued to focus on investing in infrastructure that helps to support the marketplace for  organic and other specialty broad acre crops, as you pointed out.  So this is all of the corn, beans, wheat, small grains, oil seeds, your primary row  
**[0:02:45-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:45):**  crop acres.  We've I'm trying to remember over the last 12 months, everything that we've done.  Most recently, we've purchased a division of a publicly traded company called Sunopta.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:56):**  That must have been an interesting process.  We can spend a whole podcast probably on that.  Entirely, yeah.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:02):**  But the nice thing about this is this is probably the oldest legacy business in the midstream  space for organic grains.  They've been, when one way or another, they've been doing this for almost 40 years before  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:15):**  organic was even federal law here in the US.  Based primarily in Minnesota with some exposure in Iowa.  For us, it was the opportunity to pick up a team of very good people along with some  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:31):**  strategically located assets to continue to sort of fill in our footprint from an asset  standpoint.  So today now, again, not really not realizing exactly where we left off the last time we  
**[0:03:45-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:45):**  spoke, but today now we have two elevators in Saskatchewan, two elevators in North Dakota,  four locations in Minnesota, an elevator in Iowa, corn processing facility in Iowa, soy  processing facility in Missouri, soft seed crushing facility that we have a joint venture  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:06):**  with out in Oregon.  And we also have leased an elevator in Argentina, in San Jose province.  And how many acres are you touching now?  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:17):**  Because I remember something about, I think 1.5 million last time we talked, but I will  definitely put the numbers below in the show notes, but where are we now?  I think that, you know, I think I'm not sure that we've actually increased the number of  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:30):**  acres that we've, that we're touching more than we've filled in with some critical locations  so that those acres that we're touching are better served.  And does it also mean different species you're now, different crops?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:43):**  You're now able to handle more?  Yeah, we've, we have expanded, we have quite a bit more of a food grade non GMO soybeans  going for export primarily to the far East.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:55):**  That's been one of the results of the Sunopta acquisition.  Which is interesting because you mentioned in the interview before that you were starting  this as well to serve the local US market as you are a net importer of organic soybeans,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:09):**  which is crazy as a huge soybean producer.  I know, I know.  Yeah.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:14):**  Well, I mean, ultimately I think if our goal is met the US, I'll just say North America  in general will be self-sufficient and for organic and perhaps for a regenerative organic  crops for all those varieties that we can grow here.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:30):**  Of course, there's a lot of things that we can't grow in North America, but the broad  acre crops, we can largely grow those here in North America.  And we continue to focus on trying to make the midstream more efficient because that  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:45):**  means that then there's more money to be able to share with the grower instead of spending  silly amounts of money, moving stuff all over the place, which has historically been the  case.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:57):**  We're able to now capture these bushels, these tons of products closer to the farm gate and  be able to clean them and process them and put them on rail much sooner so that now you're  saving a lot of money on all the logistics between the farm and the ultimate consumption.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:15):**  That's why you invest in assets to begin with is to lower the per unit cost of production  and handling.  Otherwise there's no reason to have assets.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:24):**  And you are placing them much closer to, but almost more decentralized processing compared  to the very centralized, only a few spots in North America can handle certain things,  which means everything is dragged around way too many times.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:38):**  Yeah, exactly.  So these are dedicated facilities serving, again, probably 90% of our volume is in the  organic grain space.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:47):**  We do have some non-GMO.  We're doing a couple of other specialty things for some customers that have asked us to do  such work, but organic is really our focus.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:58):**  And the demand continues to increase here in North America in particular.  We're trying to get the acres built up to meet that demand.  And one of the clearest ways to send a signal to the marketplace, especially to the farmers  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:12):**  is to have a flag flying in their neighborhood with a facility that can serve their needs.  And that's what these investments are all about.  And do you see that the acre size as you are now, I think you're turning three this year.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:28):**  Or the end of the year somewhere.  We were two in February.  Oh, wow.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:32):**  Okay.  You're turning three next year.  Sorry.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:35):**  And it is a three year period.  The conversion doesn't mean that you will have a lot more acres with the farmers you're  working with coming online over the next, let's say 18 months or so.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:44):**  Is that restricting you at the moment or what do you see there?  Because you mentioned, let's have more organic acres online.  Yeah.  
**[0:07:53-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:53):**  You know, last year for the 2018 crop year in North America, we participated in helping  growers convert about 60,000 new acres into what we call T1, which was the first year  of transition.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:07):**  You know, if they do this properly, they begin in the fall.  And so they really only sacrifice two crop years where they're doing the organic practice  and not getting paid for it.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:16):**  And the third crop year, they can realize the organic label and get paid for it.  This year heading into 2019, it's a very strange year in North America because a lot of the  crop area in the Midwest in particular, we've seen immense amounts of moisture.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:33):**  So we started a lot of projects this year that unfortunately probably aren't going to  go through because quite frankly, there's going to be a lot of acres that won't even  be planted this year in the Midwest of the US.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:44):**  It keeps on raining and it's, you know, the window for production planting is closing  rapidly.  And if you don't get the crop in the ground, you know, sometime in the next 10 days, you're  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:56):**  probably better off in the US taking the crop insurance option for what they call prevented  planting, which pays the farmer under certain circumstances because he wasn't able to plant.  So this year is a very strange year.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:11):**  If we had stayed on course, I think our projects would have added another maybe a hundred thousand  acres of T1 for this year.  But if it's not planted, does it count as T2?  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:22):**  Yeah.  So, so they can still go through the product.  It depends.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:27):**  Yeah.  It's complicated.  There's a lot of rules and regulations, right?  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:31):**  Let's get into the details, but I just realized if you're not planting it and does not farming  it, the land has that year.  If you started T1 last year and you didn't, you don't do anything this year, it still  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:44):**  continues to.  It's still, it's still T2.  Small silver lining.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:47):**  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So again, you know, agriculture is agriculture and every year you have a different set of  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:54):**  weather circumstances.  And this year just happens to be one of the wettest on record, particularly across the  main growing regions in the US.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:06):**  But you know, the, the, the projects are going well.  I mean, I think it's still, it's still a challenge to get growers who have not had any experience  with organic to make that transition.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:16):**  We've had more success helping growers and encouraging growers who have some organic  experience to expand their organic operations.  That seems to, one of the things we've learned over the last year is that seems to be a little  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:27):**  bit, a path, a path of less resistance.  Someone who already farmed maybe part of his farm or her farm or maybe one of their farms  organic to nudge them or to pull them into, let's do the whole one.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:41):**  Let's do the whole farm or let's increase the acres.  Or let's do at least four.  Yeah, let's at least increase the acres.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:47):**  And we, we've been introducing, you know, large land owners to farmers who are capable  of doing the organic or, or I shouldn't say who are capable, but who are experienced with  doing organic because there are landowners that would like to have their farms or their  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:03):**  land treated organically, but they don't know any growers that, you know, that have the  experience.  So we've been successful in making those introductions as well.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:12):**  It could scale pretty quickly if you have, if you have a good, let's say set of farmers  that are able and have the experience to do that.  And if you have enough of those, it could scale quite quickly.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:24):**  Yeah.  The trick is to find the, you know, the land, I mean, yeah, it's difficult to farm a long  ways away.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:31):**  Right.  So it's it's not impossible, but it's, it's, it's more of a challenge.  So trying to match up these, these footprints of in some cases, institutional landowners  
**[0:11:40-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:40):**  with, you know, the points on the map where the growers live and work today, that's a  little bit of an art.  Yeah, because probably these great farmers are, they can choose as well.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:52):**  They don't need to take, because they have their own farm, they can expand there as well.  They don't need to take many cases.  They need to take all these extra clients.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:00):**  Correct.  That's correct.  So everything has a little bit of success to it.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:05):**  You know, it's a, just, it's a longterm project.  It takes a while to, to make these things happen.  And to the point that we both made, there still is transition time, which you cannot  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:14):**  speed up.  So everything that we do today, you know, is in the earliest result possible is going  to be three crop years out.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:23):**  So it takes, you know, it takes a bit of patience.  We have been, we have been somewhat successful in connecting lenders, commercial lenders  with farmers to provide them assistance during the transition process.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:37):**  One of the things we talked about last time was, you know, this challenge that lenders  don't know, you know, we're talking primarily banks right now.  They too don't have experience with organic.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:47):**  And in some cases they're reluctant to give the farmers operating loans on terms that  realize the challenges during the transition period.  Right.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:58):**  So we've worked hard over the last, over the last year to put together, we have two banks  now that are, that are willing to make these loans to these growers that are transitioning  acres.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:09):**  And both of these banks have successfully, you know, made these loans already available.  I can't remember exactly.  I think we have about a dozen of them in process right now.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:20):**  And basically those banks also, they need to start thinking a bit longer term and not  just year by year because these farmers embark on a three, five, six year journey, maybe  their whole farm, maybe part of their farm, et cetera.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:33):**  But the results are very interesting.  I mean, the cost savings and the premium, obviously after three years start to become  very interesting, but you do need to get there.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:40):**  So was that a long process, difficult process to, to get these banks to see like the business  sense it makes for, for their clients, their farmers to go through the process?  I think it was, you know, they were dealing a little bit with the unfamiliar and organic  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:56):**  is for hippies.  Yeah.  And I mean, you know, bankers aren't necessarily the most ready to move on new things, right?  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:02):**  They are very much in a risk mitigation mode.  Some bankers, yeah.  Some bankers.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:08):**  Yeah, true.  But, you know, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be candid with you.  We've had our most success with Rabobank.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:16):**  Rabobank is our commercial bank here at Pipeline Foods and they also have come alongside us  to provide transition financing.  They've, we've built a, you know, a product, essentially a lending product, which gives  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:30):**  the grower the opportunity to, to borrow money, to make it through the transition period and  pay it back on an extended basis.  Once they reach the organic status and have the, have the additional funds to be able  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:44):**  to pay that back, it's a creative product.  It's, it will probably get tweaked and improved as the years go on.  But at least, you know, you have the largest, Rabob is the largest agricultural lender in  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:55):**  the world.  And because they are our commercial bank and because we have sort of a shared view of sustainable  agriculture, it's been very fun to work with them on this project because it's, you know,  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:07):**  it's at some level, it's almost infinitely scalable with the size of resources that they  have.  So this year, this year we're going to pilot probably a half dozen or so projects with  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:17):**  them where we're providing a long-term off-take agreement, they're providing the working capital,  the farmers in a position to, to win through this, you know, three way relationship.  We think that has a tremendous opportunity to scale.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:31):**  And that, that's for us, one of the greatest successes this year is putting that program  together.  It's very, very exciting.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:38):**  I saw a news item on them actually in the Netherlands of, I think some loans to also  farmers and in this case dairy, and that actually the interest rate was, could be slightly modified  or slightly lower if they hit certain biodiversity targets and certain soil biodiversity targets  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:56):**  as well.  Very, very small scale stuff, obviously, but interestingly, they're also connecting how  they were doing sustainable, on the sustainability indexes to actually paying less for your,  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:08):**  for your loan in this case.  So they're, they're playing, they're definitely flexing their muscles in the space because  I think also they see, or they should see that the farmers that are willing to go through  
**[0:16:18-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:18):**  this transition are probably the more entrepreneurial, the more farmers with more potential and as  a bank, I think you want to be part of that.  Yeah.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:28):**  I mean, I thought we were, we were very happy with we continue to be very happy with our  relationship with them.  And they've been you know, very progressive in terms of their approach to this whole,  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:39):**  to this whole sector.  And you know, again, I'm sure that what we have done this year is not going to be the  final of what we will do in the future.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:47):**  But at this point, it's, it's a good first step and we're very pleased.  And again, because because of the size of the institution and because of their presence,  especially in North America, you know, we feel like this, this year assuming success  
**[0:17:02-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:02):**  this year that we can, we'll really be able to push, push hard for the 2020 crop year  and sign up a lot more acres using this, you know, this lending mechanism that Rabo has  architected expressly for this purpose.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:18):**  And we've also been working with some, some non GM, some non-governmental, some NGO organizations,  as well as foundations who are interested in supporting this.  So we're experimenting with whether they, they too can come alongside the bank and help  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:35):**  participate in either de-risking the bank's position or perhaps lowering the interest  rate for the farmer.  So we continue to explore.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:42):**  How would, how would that work?  Just, just dreaming.  I mean, obviously that's a pilot or it's an idea, but how would that just sketching your  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:50):**  idea?  How would it work?  These institutions have capital.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:55):**  Some of it's philanthropic capital.  Some of it is investable capital, either as equity or debt.  So for those institutions that are inclined to view agriculture, sustainable agriculture,  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:06):**  regenerative agriculture, organic agriculture, as being mission critical to their, you know,  to the, whatever it is that their purpose for being, they view agriculture as being  one of the important components of their portfolio.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:21):**  We've been, we've had a number of very interesting conversations because they're looking for  ways that they can, they can take their not insignificant amount of capital, but certainly  not as much as somebody like a Rabobank has and use it to create a, you know, sort of  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:37):**  an ignition device that will again, either de-risk the bank's position, perhaps as a,  as a guarantor, if you will, of the loan from the farm to the farmer or in other cases,  what we've discussed is putting, putting capital into a pool that comes alongside the bank  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:56):**  capital, but the capital that the institution puts into the pool is at a much lower interest  rate and therefore can add on a blended basis, can bring down the interest rate to the grower.  So these are two different mechanisms that, that, you know, we're, we're fairly advanced  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:11):**  in the conversation.  I don't know that we're actually going to have any of those projects stood up for 2019.  It's too late, I think at this point, but I'm quite confident that we'll have one or  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:22):**  more flavours of that, of that type of idea in play for 2020.  Because is that one of the main things you see missing, this transition finance piece  for, for your farmers, the farmers you're working with?  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:35):**  Correct.  Yeah.  We've been able to put together other resources like agronomists or like I said, experienced  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:41):**  growers on the off-tech agreements and the off-tech agreements and everything else, but  the transition financing has been, has been tricky and we identified it early, but we  took us quite a while to find, to find institutions that, banking institutions that were willing  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:56):**  to, to participate.  So we continue to press hard into that, into that area, financial support for growers who  are, who are, you know, going into a program that long-term is going to serve them very  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:09):**  well.  But in the short term is a challenge trying to match that up with commercial scale dollars  to support them in that process.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:16):**  Yeah.  Because when you say financial support, obviously everybody thinks, oh, they need, they need  nonprofit finance or they need grant support, but actually it's an investment.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:24):**  It's a long-term investment, but it's an investment.  It's a long-term investment.  Correct.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:28):**  And as you know, it's, it's relatively easy to have the conversation today because conventional  agriculture has been so difficult.  It's sort of helping you.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:36):**  It's helping us, right?  I mean, in the U S between, you know, heavy stocks of everything essentially, and now,  you know, with the situation with the, with the Chinese, we have quite a bit of unsold,  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:50):**  you know, products still in the bins from last year.  And you know, at this time of the year, you'd like to see some of that stuff moving, but  our number one customer is no longer our number one customer.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:01):**  So when you say we, you mean you as an agriculture sector as a whole, not pipeline food.  No, no, I'm not pipeline, but I mean, I'm just talking about the sector as a whole.  Cause you could observe a lot more.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:11):**  I mean, you're, you're pushing so hard on the acre, so on transition finance because  the market is asking you to supply more organic soy, corn, wheat, etc.  Correct.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:22):**  Correct.  And you know, we keep on fighting this, this issue of these fraudulent imports coming in  primarily from the black sea as we're fighting the same battle the EU is trying to keep the  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:33):**  fraudulent organic products out of the supply chain.  But in order to be able to do that, you have to have domestic products sufficient to meet  the demand.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:41):**  You can't just shut the door on the one side, you know, and, and not supply it on the other.  So you know, as we build up these stocks, build up these, this production here in North  America, we're more and more able to you know, defend ourselves, I guess I would say from  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:00):**  some of these profiteers who you know, who have been bringing stuff in that is sketchy  at best.  And it's much worse at worst.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:11):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  So that's been going well.  We're excited about that.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:16):**  You know, on the, on the regenerative side, two things I guess would be probably reasonably  interesting to report.  Yeah, because you mentioned regenerative organic actually like just before I think a few minutes  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:29):**  ago.  What's been happening in that space?  Well, so now there is a regenerative organic label.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:36):**  It's yet another label like we needed another label, but any case we have it.  There's so much space in the packaging anyway.  So you can go to regenerative, I think it's regenerativeagriculture.com.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:50):**  I can't remember exactly what the website is, but I'll put it in this here notes.  Yeah, there is a label.  A few very progressive food companies have signed up for this.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:01):**  It starts out with the organic, the USDA organic as the baseline.  And then I think has three levels of improvement above that, which include in the case of animals,  certain animal welfare provisions in the case of crops, certain situations like ground cover  
**[0:23:19-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:19):**  and water usage and things of this sort.  So it is not caught on fire yet by any stretch of the imagination, but we are still trying  to encourage food companies that want to get more progressive, even beyond organic, that  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:35):**  we can connect them with the growers that are interested in going down that path that  they can find a value-added market for those crops.  So that's still very early days, but it's gone beyond.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:48):**  So a year ago we were talking about an idea.  Now there is a label, there is a structure, it's not a USDA.  It's not done yet as well.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:57):**  Yeah.  I think at the end of the year, there should be more updates around it, but at least some  people came together and sort of set the boundaries of what something could be.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:07):**  Yeah.  And it's outside of the regulations.  So the USDA is not going to participate in overseeing the regenerative piece.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:15):**  But again, the baseline is USDA organic as the starting point and the three levels above  that that the regenerative organic label offers are additions to the USDA organic seal.  So we'll see.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:32):**  The other problem with regenerative is, as with sustainability, I will say is that the  conventional guys are trying to figure out how to use all these taglines themselves.  Yeah.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:47):**  We've seen some very interesting examples of that from alcohol companies.  And I don't know what we tried to cover it a bit in the newsroom, regeneration newsroom  podcast.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:56):**  I record with Ethan Soloveyev, but it's been funny to see some things called regenerative  that everybody can see has been very, very far from.  Yeah.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:07):**  And, you know, I mean, I applaud all efforts to reduce chemical use, even if it's not fully  organic any time, any time that you can reduce the amount of, you know, chemically.  I'm all in favor of that.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:20):**  But the idea that that is regenerative, you know, is still a long ways from the intended  use of the word.  So unfortunately, you can't you can't patent words, you know, that already exist.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:33):**  But you came up with a term that was a new word, perhaps you could patent that.  But so we do see increasingly the conventional folks trying to, you know, me too, these terms  which are popular with consumers.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:48):**  And do you see the market like straw?  Do you see the main, let's say your current clients, your current companies that buy these  brokers, process brokers of you?  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:00):**  Is there another conversation compared to a year ago?  And is there interest in maybe this regenerative organic route or is there another route they're  interested in?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:08):**  Well, I'd say, again, it's slow to come.  It is not it has not caught fire by any stretch of the imagination.  But there's a there's a corner of the market that's interested in continuing to push for  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:19):**  cleaner and cleaner crops.  And sometimes it's called regenerative.  There's also been a significant movement, I think globally against pesticide residues.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:31):**  And so, you know, that doesn't it may not be directly addressed in the regenerative  label, so to speak.  But I think, you know, with the recent court cases here in the U.S. about glyphosate poisoning  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:45):**  being awarded to individuals and with the I think the general understanding through  testing that we're ingesting both through our food and our water, more more chemistry  than we imagined.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:59):**  We see certain markets headed in the direction of glyphosate free, for example, which isn't  isn't a regulated business model, but it means what it says.  You cannot ship product into these markets, you know, with with glyphosate residues exceeding  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:17):**  a certain amount, if at all.  And so that's going to continue to change the nature of the way in which certain areas  grow crops, because their markets may demand that they ship residue free or minimal residue.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:33):**  And they don't fit neatly into the organic package.  They don't fit neatly into the regenerative package.  But it's a start.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:40):**  But it's a start.  It's I see the attention with the court cases now and things like Zach Bush and  Farmer's Footprint that finally we're getting more attention for that.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:51):**  We've discussed water before actually a year ago and the state of the water pollution in  many, many farmers areas.  And finally, we're starting to discuss way too late, obviously, but at least it's  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:02):**  discussed.  At least the sources discussed, which is which is agriculture in many, many cases.  Well, and it's interesting because if you take the long view and think about converging  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:11):**  concepts of, you know, some of the conversation that we've been seeing is headed towards,  you know, we spend this much money on chemicals and then we spend this much money on health  care.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:21):**  Right.  And do the two have anything to do with each other?  And there's an increasing body of evidence and certainly an increasing conversation that  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:29):**  the two have everything to do with each other.  Food is medicine.  Food is medicine.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:33):**  I think the court artist said that.  Right.  Three thousand years ago or two and a half.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:37):**  Yeah.  And then, you know, water as well is, you know, to the point that you're making not  only not only farm chemicals and water, but pharmaceutical chemicals in the water.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:47):**  So there's an increasing understanding that taking care of the environment is a good business.  But boy, there's an awful lot of money and effort being spent by the incumbents in the  space and the chemical and pharmaceutical industries to deny that there's any any issues  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:03):**  that, you know, that exist or that there's something that we should be doing about them.  So it's going to be it's really at this point, the consumer against against industry, you  know, and that's pretty universal.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:16):**  It's not 100 percent the case, but it's it's pretty much going to be what's good for people  versus what's good for, you know, certain companies profits.  And this is not going to be a battle that's going to be easily won until and unless the  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:29):**  consumers have clear options and they're willing to they're willing to, you know, make sure  that they take money out of their wallet only for things that support whatever their view  is of the marketplace.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:40):**  And it doesn't necessarily mean it has to be more expensive.  You know, that's one of the other great myths is that everything has to be more expensive  if it's if it's not if it's not conventional.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:49):**  I think that that is maybe true in the short term.  But the more that we can get, you know, better environmental practices on the farm, the more  universal that becomes.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:00):**  I don't think it necessarily leads to a higher cost of food.  And the food is medicine, you know, particularly here in the U.S. where we spend so little  as a share of our wallet on food, if we spend a couple more points on good food, I think  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:16):**  the outcomes will be obvious.  So you can see it coming.  It's a you know, all these all these conversations are sort of heading, heading towards what  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:25):**  I hope is a common understanding that we are what we eat and that includes the environment.  But you know, we've got many generations of common practices that we have to just be patient.  We have to keep on pushing, but we have to understand that nothing's going to happen  
**[0:30:42-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:42):**  overnight.  And actually, that's a perfect bridge to my final question.  I asked it before and I want to see if your answer changed.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:49):**  Maybe the last year changed something on that.  If you could change one thing overnight, if you could wave your magic wand and say, OK,  tomorrow morning, we'll wake up.  
**[0:30:57-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:57):**  What would it be?  I don't remember what I said a year ago.  I think at this point, I've become convinced that glyphosate as an herbicide and many of  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:08):**  the pesticides are much more toxic than we've understood in the past.  I would do away with them.  And I think that there's a short term reality to that.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:20):**  That means you have to manage things in a different way.  But the longer term reality is that nature is adapting much more quickly than we can  in the chemistry lab.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:29):**  And so all these pests that we've been fighting, particularly on the herbicides side of things,  you know, these plants are becoming increasingly tolerant.  You know, the same things happening in human medicine as well.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:42):**  Right.  That's it's I think we have to be careful not to encourage Mother Nature to come out  with her most recent version of tolerance strains of most recent dimensions.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:55):**  It could be very dangerous.  Yeah.  Most recent that it can be very dangerous.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:00):**  So that that is, you know, I think in the last year in particular, that conversation  has me I'm happy that we're having a conversation.  It's become such a constant conversation that you can't help but go to bed at night a little  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:13):**  bit worried about the state of things.  So I would say getting rid of glyphosate and getting rid of, you know, certain classes  of pesticides would be probably my number one wish at this point.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:26):**  And I always do this.  I ask a final question and then I come up with another one.  How could people help you?  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:32):**  What could people I mean, there are quite some investors listening to the case, maybe  not the size of a gravel bank and institutional investors like that.  But it might have creativity or what would be something that people can help you and  
**[0:32:46-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:46):**  pipeline foods with, let's say in the next year?  You know, I think funding for good science is important.  You know, we seem to have gotten ourselves to a point where we're sort of selectively  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:58):**  using science as a weapon.  We've taken science out of the public domain and put it in the private domain.  And the danger with that is that whoever funds whatever scientific experiment, of course,  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:11):**  gets the answer they're looking for.  And that to me is extremely dangerous.  So I would say funding for, you know, public funding for research so that science has an  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:22):**  objective voice in these conversations is ultimately going to be the most critical path  forward.  And it's not hard for us to find publicly funded research anymore on some of these topics  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:32):**  because it simply has been defunded and put in the private domain.  And with that, I cannot agree more, obviously.  I want to thank you for your time, Eric.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:42):**  And I'll be checking in with you again somewhere over the next years.  OK, thank you very much.  Thank you so much.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:50):**  Take care.  I hope you enjoyed this update with Eric and learned something about the challenges and  opportunities of transition finance.

**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:34:50):**  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:35:00):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:35:14):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision-making framework, what to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  
**[0:35:25-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:35:25):**  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?  
**[0:35:29-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:35:29):**  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:35:34):**  You the soil builders and investors in the space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  farm builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:35:48):**  designers, holistic management, consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:36:00):**  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  et cetera.  Is this course free?  
**[0:36:08-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:36:08):**  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:36:15):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:36:26):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?  
**[0:36:31-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:36:31):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:36:44):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:36:56):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:37:09):**  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:37:15):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:37:26):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on  the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

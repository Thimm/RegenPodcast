**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:13):**  This interview is a check-in interview with Eric Jackson of Pipeline Foods, and we dive  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:17):**  deep into transition finance, how to finance farmers and get many, many more row crop acres  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:23):**  into organic and eventually regenerative production.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:28):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:32):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:34):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:38-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:38):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:44):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:48):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:50):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:54):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat, and it's time that we as investors, big and small  
**[0:00:59-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:00:59):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:06):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job, and I  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:10):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:14):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:18):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:22):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:27):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:32):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you, and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:36):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:44):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:47):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:48):**  Welcome to a new episode.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:49):**  I'm Koen Vossain, your host, and today I have the great pleasure to have Eric Jackson back  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:53):**  on the podcast.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:54):**  I've interviewed him in June, 2018, so almost a year ago.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:01:57):**  And although we talked for over an hour, we had so much more to cover.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:00):**  I will link the earlier interview in the show notes below.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:03):**  Eric is the founder and CEO of Pipeline Foods, who after a career in conventional chemical  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:07):**  agriculture and software could retire, but decided to build the missing link in organic  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:12):**  broad acre row crops, mainly corn and soy.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:15):**  Welcome back, Eric.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:16):**  Thank you, Koen.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:17):**  It's a pleasure to be back with you after, as you pointed out, almost a year.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:23):**  It's been a busy year for us here at Pipeline Foods.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:25):**  We've continued to focus on investing in infrastructure that helps to support the marketplace for  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:32):**  organic and other specialty broad acre crops, as you pointed out.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:37):**  So this is all of the corn, beans, wheat, small grains, oil seeds, your primary row  
**[0:02:45-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:45):**  crop acres.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:47):**  We've I'm trying to remember over the last 12 months, everything that we've done.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:50):**  Most recently, we've purchased a division of a publicly traded company called Sunopta.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:56):**  That must have been an interesting process.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:02:58):**  We can spend a whole podcast probably on that.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:01):**  Entirely, yeah.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:02):**  But the nice thing about this is this is probably the oldest legacy business in the midstream  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:09):**  space for organic grains.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:10):**  They've been, when one way or another, they've been doing this for almost 40 years before  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:15):**  organic was even federal law here in the US.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:21):**  Based primarily in Minnesota with some exposure in Iowa.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:25):**  For us, it was the opportunity to pick up a team of very good people along with some  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:31):**  strategically located assets to continue to sort of fill in our footprint from an asset  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:38):**  standpoint.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:39):**  So today now, again, not really not realizing exactly where we left off the last time we  
**[0:03:45-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:45):**  spoke, but today now we have two elevators in Saskatchewan, two elevators in North Dakota,  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:52):**  four locations in Minnesota, an elevator in Iowa, corn processing facility in Iowa, soy  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:03:59):**  processing facility in Missouri, soft seed crushing facility that we have a joint venture  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:06):**  with out in Oregon.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:08):**  And we also have leased an elevator in Argentina, in San Jose province.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:14):**  And how many acres are you touching now?  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:17):**  Because I remember something about, I think 1.5 million last time we talked, but I will  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:22):**  definitely put the numbers below in the show notes, but where are we now?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:26):**  I think that, you know, I think I'm not sure that we've actually increased the number of  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:30):**  acres that we've, that we're touching more than we've filled in with some critical locations  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:37):**  so that those acres that we're touching are better served.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:40):**  And does it also mean different species you're now, different crops?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:43):**  You're now able to handle more?  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:46):**  Yeah, we've, we have expanded, we have quite a bit more of a food grade non GMO soybeans  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:52):**  going for export primarily to the far East.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:55):**  That's been one of the results of the Sunopta acquisition.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:04:58):**  Which is interesting because you mentioned in the interview before that you were starting  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:02):**  this as well to serve the local US market as you are a net importer of organic soybeans,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:09):**  which is crazy as a huge soybean producer.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:12):**  I know, I know.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:14):**  Well, I mean, ultimately I think if our goal is met the US, I'll just say North America  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:19):**  in general will be self-sufficient and for organic and perhaps for a regenerative organic  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:26):**  crops for all those varieties that we can grow here.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:30):**  Of course, there's a lot of things that we can't grow in North America, but the broad  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:34):**  acre crops, we can largely grow those here in North America.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:38):**  And we continue to focus on trying to make the midstream more efficient because that  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:45):**  means that then there's more money to be able to share with the grower instead of spending  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:51):**  silly amounts of money, moving stuff all over the place, which has historically been the  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:56):**  case.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:05:57):**  We're able to now capture these bushels, these tons of products closer to the farm gate and  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:03):**  be able to clean them and process them and put them on rail much sooner so that now you're  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:09):**  saving a lot of money on all the logistics between the farm and the ultimate consumption.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:15):**  That's why you invest in assets to begin with is to lower the per unit cost of production  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:21):**  and handling.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:22):**  Otherwise there's no reason to have assets.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:24):**  And you are placing them much closer to, but almost more decentralized processing compared  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:30):**  to the very centralized, only a few spots in North America can handle certain things,  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:34):**  which means everything is dragged around way too many times.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:38):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:39):**  So these are dedicated facilities serving, again, probably 90% of our volume is in the  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:45):**  organic grain space.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:47):**  We do have some non-GMO.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:49):**  We're doing a couple of other specialty things for some customers that have asked us to do  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:54):**  such work, but organic is really our focus.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:06:58):**  And the demand continues to increase here in North America in particular.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:03):**  We're trying to get the acres built up to meet that demand.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:07):**  And one of the clearest ways to send a signal to the marketplace, especially to the farmers  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:12):**  is to have a flag flying in their neighborhood with a facility that can serve their needs.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:19):**  And that's what these investments are all about.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:21):**  And do you see that the acre size as you are now, I think you're turning three this year.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:28):**  Or the end of the year somewhere.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:30):**  We were two in February.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:31):**  Oh, wow.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:32):**  Okay.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:33):**  You're turning three next year.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:34):**  Sorry.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:35):**  And it is a three year period.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:36):**  The conversion doesn't mean that you will have a lot more acres with the farmers you're  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:40):**  working with coming online over the next, let's say 18 months or so.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:44):**  Is that restricting you at the moment or what do you see there?  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:48):**  Because you mentioned, let's have more organic acres online.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:53-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:07:53):**  You know, last year for the 2018 crop year in North America, we participated in helping  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:00):**  growers convert about 60,000 new acres into what we call T1, which was the first year  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:06):**  of transition.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:07):**  You know, if they do this properly, they begin in the fall.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:11):**  And so they really only sacrifice two crop years where they're doing the organic practice  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:15):**  and not getting paid for it.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:16):**  And the third crop year, they can realize the organic label and get paid for it.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:22):**  This year heading into 2019, it's a very strange year in North America because a lot of the  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:27):**  crop area in the Midwest in particular, we've seen immense amounts of moisture.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:33):**  So we started a lot of projects this year that unfortunately probably aren't going to  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:37):**  go through because quite frankly, there's going to be a lot of acres that won't even  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:40):**  be planted this year in the Midwest of the US.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:44):**  It keeps on raining and it's, you know, the window for production planting is closing  
**[0:08:51-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:51):**  rapidly.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:52):**  And if you don't get the crop in the ground, you know, sometime in the next 10 days, you're  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:08:56):**  probably better off in the US taking the crop insurance option for what they call prevented  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:02):**  planting, which pays the farmer under certain circumstances because he wasn't able to plant.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:08):**  So this year is a very strange year.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:11):**  If we had stayed on course, I think our projects would have added another maybe a hundred thousand  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:16):**  acres of T1 for this year.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:19):**  But if it's not planted, does it count as T2?  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:23):**  So, so they can still go through the product.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:26):**  It depends.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:28):**  It's complicated.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:29):**  There's a lot of rules and regulations, right?  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:31):**  Let's get into the details, but I just realized if you're not planting it and does not farming  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:36):**  it, the land has that year.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:40):**  If you started T1 last year and you didn't, you don't do anything this year, it still  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:44):**  continues to.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:45):**  It's still, it's still T2.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:46):**  Small silver lining.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:48):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:51):**  So again, you know, agriculture is agriculture and every year you have a different set of  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:54):**  weather circumstances.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:09:56):**  And this year just happens to be one of the wettest on record, particularly across the  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:02):**  main growing regions in the US.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:06):**  But you know, the, the, the projects are going well.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:08):**  I mean, I think it's still, it's still a challenge to get growers who have not had any experience  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:13):**  with organic to make that transition.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:16):**  We've had more success helping growers and encouraging growers who have some organic  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:20):**  experience to expand their organic operations.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:23):**  That seems to, one of the things we've learned over the last year is that seems to be a little  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:27):**  bit, a path, a path of less resistance.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:31):**  Someone who already farmed maybe part of his farm or her farm or maybe one of their farms  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:36):**  organic to nudge them or to pull them into, let's do the whole one.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:41):**  Let's do the whole farm or let's increase the acres.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:43):**  Or let's do at least four.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:45):**  Yeah, let's at least increase the acres.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:47):**  And we, we've been introducing, you know, large land owners to farmers who are capable  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:53):**  of doing the organic or, or I shouldn't say who are capable, but who are experienced with  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:10:58):**  doing organic because there are landowners that would like to have their farms or their  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:03):**  land treated organically, but they don't know any growers that, you know, that have the  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:08):**  experience.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:09):**  So we've been successful in making those introductions as well.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:12):**  It could scale pretty quickly if you have, if you have a good, let's say set of farmers  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:18):**  that are able and have the experience to do that.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:20):**  And if you have enough of those, it could scale quite quickly.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:25):**  The trick is to find the, you know, the land, I mean, yeah, it's difficult to farm a long  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:30):**  ways away.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:31):**  Right.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:32):**  So it's it's not impossible, but it's, it's, it's more of a challenge.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:34):**  So trying to match up these, these footprints of in some cases, institutional landowners  
**[0:11:40-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:40):**  with, you know, the points on the map where the growers live and work today, that's a  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:47):**  little bit of an art.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:48):**  Yeah, because probably these great farmers are, they can choose as well.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:52):**  They don't need to take, because they have their own farm, they can expand there as well.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:55):**  They don't need to take many cases.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:11:57):**  They need to take all these extra clients.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:00):**  Correct.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:01):**  That's correct.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:02):**  So everything has a little bit of success to it.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:05):**  You know, it's a, just, it's a longterm project.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:07):**  It takes a while to, to make these things happen.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:10):**  And to the point that we both made, there still is transition time, which you cannot  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:14):**  speed up.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:15):**  So everything that we do today, you know, is in the earliest result possible is going  
**[0:12:21-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:21):**  to be three crop years out.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:23):**  So it takes, you know, it takes a bit of patience.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:26):**  We have been, we have been somewhat successful in connecting lenders, commercial lenders  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:33):**  with farmers to provide them assistance during the transition process.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:37):**  One of the things we talked about last time was, you know, this challenge that lenders  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:41):**  don't know, you know, we're talking primarily banks right now.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:45):**  They too don't have experience with organic.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:47):**  And in some cases they're reluctant to give the farmers operating loans on terms that  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:54):**  realize the challenges during the transition period.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:57):**  Right.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:12:58):**  So we've worked hard over the last, over the last year to put together, we have two banks  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:03):**  now that are, that are willing to make these loans to these growers that are transitioning  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:08):**  acres.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:09):**  And both of these banks have successfully, you know, made these loans already available.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:15):**  I can't remember exactly.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:16):**  I think we have about a dozen of them in process right now.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:20):**  And basically those banks also, they need to start thinking a bit longer term and not  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:24):**  just year by year because these farmers embark on a three, five, six year journey, maybe  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:30):**  their whole farm, maybe part of their farm, et cetera.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:33):**  But the results are very interesting.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:34):**  I mean, the cost savings and the premium, obviously after three years start to become  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:38):**  very interesting, but you do need to get there.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:40):**  So was that a long process, difficult process to, to get these banks to see like the business  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:47):**  sense it makes for, for their clients, their farmers to go through the process?  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:51):**  I think it was, you know, they were dealing a little bit with the unfamiliar and organic  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:56):**  is for hippies.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:13:58):**  And I mean, you know, bankers aren't necessarily the most ready to move on new things, right?  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:02):**  They are very much in a risk mitigation mode.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:06):**  Some bankers, yeah.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:07):**  Some bankers.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:08):**  Yeah, true.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:09):**  But, you know, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be candid with you.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:13):**  We've had our most success with Rabobank.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:16):**  Rabobank is our commercial bank here at Pipeline Foods and they also have come alongside us  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:22):**  to provide transition financing.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:24):**  They've, we've built a, you know, a product, essentially a lending product, which gives  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:30):**  the grower the opportunity to, to borrow money, to make it through the transition period and  
**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:36):**  pay it back on an extended basis.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:39):**  Once they reach the organic status and have the, have the additional funds to be able  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:44):**  to pay that back, it's a creative product.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:47):**  It's, it will probably get tweaked and improved as the years go on.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:51):**  But at least, you know, you have the largest, Rabob is the largest agricultural lender in  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:55):**  the world.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:14:57):**  And because they are our commercial bank and because we have sort of a shared view of sustainable  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:02):**  agriculture, it's been very fun to work with them on this project because it's, you know,  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:07):**  it's at some level, it's almost infinitely scalable with the size of resources that they  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:12):**  have.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:13):**  So this year, this year we're going to pilot probably a half dozen or so projects with  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:17):**  them where we're providing a long-term off-take agreement, they're providing the working capital,  
**[0:15:22-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:22):**  the farmers in a position to, to win through this, you know, three way relationship.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:29):**  We think that has a tremendous opportunity to scale.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:31):**  And that, that's for us, one of the greatest successes this year is putting that program  
**[0:15:36-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:36):**  together.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:37):**  It's very, very exciting.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:38):**  I saw a news item on them actually in the Netherlands of, I think some loans to also  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:45):**  farmers and in this case dairy, and that actually the interest rate was, could be slightly modified  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:51):**  or slightly lower if they hit certain biodiversity targets and certain soil biodiversity targets  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:56):**  as well.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:15:57):**  Very, very small scale stuff, obviously, but interestingly, they're also connecting how  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:02):**  they were doing sustainable, on the sustainability indexes to actually paying less for your,  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:08):**  for your loan in this case.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:09):**  So they're, they're playing, they're definitely flexing their muscles in the space because  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:14):**  I think also they see, or they should see that the farmers that are willing to go through  
**[0:16:18-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:18):**  this transition are probably the more entrepreneurial, the more farmers with more potential and as  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:25):**  a bank, I think you want to be part of that.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:28):**  I mean, I thought we were, we were very happy with we continue to be very happy with our  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:32):**  relationship with them.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:33):**  And they've been you know, very progressive in terms of their approach to this whole,  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:39):**  to this whole sector.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:41):**  And you know, again, I'm sure that what we have done this year is not going to be the  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:45):**  final of what we will do in the future.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:47):**  But at this point, it's, it's a good first step and we're very pleased.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:53):**  And again, because because of the size of the institution and because of their presence,  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:16:57):**  especially in North America, you know, we feel like this, this year assuming success  
**[0:17:02-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:02):**  this year that we can, we'll really be able to push, push hard for the 2020 crop year  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:09):**  and sign up a lot more acres using this, you know, this lending mechanism that Rabo has  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:15):**  architected expressly for this purpose.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:18):**  And we've also been working with some, some non GM, some non-governmental, some NGO organizations,  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:26):**  as well as foundations who are interested in supporting this.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:30):**  So we're experimenting with whether they, they too can come alongside the bank and help  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:35):**  participate in either de-risking the bank's position or perhaps lowering the interest  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:39):**  rate for the farmer.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:41):**  So we continue to explore.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:42):**  How would, how would that work?  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:44):**  Just, just dreaming.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:45):**  I mean, obviously that's a pilot or it's an idea, but how would that just sketching your  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:50):**  idea?  
**[0:17:51-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:51):**  How would it work?  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:52):**  These institutions have capital.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:55):**  Some of it's philanthropic capital.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:17:56):**  Some of it is investable capital, either as equity or debt.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:00):**  So for those institutions that are inclined to view agriculture, sustainable agriculture,  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:06):**  regenerative agriculture, organic agriculture, as being mission critical to their, you know,  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:11):**  to the, whatever it is that their purpose for being, they view agriculture as being  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:16):**  one of the important components of their portfolio.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:21):**  We've been, we've had a number of very interesting conversations because they're looking for  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:25):**  ways that they can, they can take their not insignificant amount of capital, but certainly  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:31):**  not as much as somebody like a Rabobank has and use it to create a, you know, sort of  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:37):**  an ignition device that will again, either de-risk the bank's position, perhaps as a,  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:44):**  as a guarantor, if you will, of the loan from the farm to the farmer or in other cases,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:50):**  what we've discussed is putting, putting capital into a pool that comes alongside the bank  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:18:56):**  capital, but the capital that the institution puts into the pool is at a much lower interest  
**[0:19:00-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:00):**  rate and therefore can add on a blended basis, can bring down the interest rate to the grower.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:07):**  So these are two different mechanisms that, that, you know, we're, we're fairly advanced  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:11):**  in the conversation.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:12):**  I don't know that we're actually going to have any of those projects stood up for 2019.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:17):**  It's too late, I think at this point, but I'm quite confident that we'll have one or  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:22):**  more flavours of that, of that type of idea in play for 2020.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:27):**  Because is that one of the main things you see missing, this transition finance piece  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:31):**  for, for your farmers, the farmers you're working with?  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:35):**  Correct.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:37):**  We've been able to put together other resources like agronomists or like I said, experienced  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:41):**  growers on the off-tech agreements and the off-tech agreements and everything else, but  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:45):**  the transition financing has been, has been tricky and we identified it early, but we  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:51):**  took us quite a while to find, to find institutions that, banking institutions that were willing  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:56):**  to, to participate.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:19:58):**  So we continue to press hard into that, into that area, financial support for growers who  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:03):**  are, who are, you know, going into a program that long-term is going to serve them very  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:09):**  well.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:10):**  But in the short term is a challenge trying to match that up with commercial scale dollars  
**[0:20:14-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:14):**  to support them in that process.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:17):**  Because when you say financial support, obviously everybody thinks, oh, they need, they need  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:20):**  nonprofit finance or they need grant support, but actually it's an investment.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:24):**  It's a long-term investment, but it's an investment.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:26):**  It's a long-term investment.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:27):**  Correct.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:28):**  And as you know, it's, it's relatively easy to have the conversation today because conventional  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:32):**  agriculture has been so difficult.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:34):**  It's sort of helping you.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:36):**  It's helping us, right?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:38):**  I mean, in the U S between, you know, heavy stocks of everything essentially, and now,  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:45):**  you know, with the situation with the, with the Chinese, we have quite a bit of unsold,  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:50):**  you know, products still in the bins from last year.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:54):**  And you know, at this time of the year, you'd like to see some of that stuff moving, but  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:20:57):**  our number one customer is no longer our number one customer.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:01):**  So when you say we, you mean you as an agriculture sector as a whole, not pipeline food.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:05):**  No, no, I'm not pipeline, but I mean, I'm just talking about the sector as a whole.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:09):**  Cause you could observe a lot more.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:11):**  I mean, you're, you're pushing so hard on the acre, so on transition finance because  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:14):**  the market is asking you to supply more organic soy, corn, wheat, etc.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:21):**  Correct.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:22):**  Correct.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:23):**  And you know, we keep on fighting this, this issue of these fraudulent imports coming in  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:27):**  primarily from the black sea as we're fighting the same battle the EU is trying to keep the  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:33):**  fraudulent organic products out of the supply chain.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:37):**  But in order to be able to do that, you have to have domestic products sufficient to meet  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:40):**  the demand.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:41):**  You can't just shut the door on the one side, you know, and, and not supply it on the other.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:48):**  So you know, as we build up these stocks, build up these, this production here in North  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:21:55):**  America, we're more and more able to you know, defend ourselves, I guess I would say from  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:00):**  some of these profiteers who you know, who have been bringing stuff in that is sketchy  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:06):**  at best.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:08):**  And it's much worse at worst.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:11):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:13):**  So that's been going well.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:14):**  We're excited about that.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:16):**  You know, on the, on the regenerative side, two things I guess would be probably reasonably  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:22):**  interesting to report.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:23):**  Yeah, because you mentioned regenerative organic actually like just before I think a few minutes  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:29):**  ago.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:30):**  What's been happening in that space?  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:32):**  Well, so now there is a regenerative organic label.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:36):**  It's yet another label like we needed another label, but any case we have it.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:40):**  There's so much space in the packaging anyway.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:45):**  So you can go to regenerative, I think it's regenerativeagriculture.com.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:50):**  I can't remember exactly what the website is, but I'll put it in this here notes.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:54):**  Yeah, there is a label.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:22:55):**  A few very progressive food companies have signed up for this.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:01):**  It starts out with the organic, the USDA organic as the baseline.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:07):**  And then I think has three levels of improvement above that, which include in the case of animals,  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:13):**  certain animal welfare provisions in the case of crops, certain situations like ground cover  
**[0:23:19-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:19):**  and water usage and things of this sort.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:22):**  So it is not caught on fire yet by any stretch of the imagination, but we are still trying  
**[0:23:27-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:27):**  to encourage food companies that want to get more progressive, even beyond organic, that  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:35):**  we can connect them with the growers that are interested in going down that path that  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:40):**  they can find a value-added market for those crops.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:43):**  So that's still very early days, but it's gone beyond.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:48):**  So a year ago we were talking about an idea.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:50):**  Now there is a label, there is a structure, it's not a USDA.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:56):**  It's not done yet as well.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:23:58):**  I think at the end of the year, there should be more updates around it, but at least some  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:03):**  people came together and sort of set the boundaries of what something could be.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:08):**  And it's outside of the regulations.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:10):**  So the USDA is not going to participate in overseeing the regenerative piece.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:15):**  But again, the baseline is USDA organic as the starting point and the three levels above  
**[0:24:21-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:21):**  that that the regenerative organic label offers are additions to the USDA organic seal.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:30):**  So we'll see.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:32):**  The other problem with regenerative is, as with sustainability, I will say is that the  
**[0:24:39-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:39):**  conventional guys are trying to figure out how to use all these taglines themselves.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:47):**  We've seen some very interesting examples of that from alcohol companies.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:51):**  And I don't know what we tried to cover it a bit in the newsroom, regeneration newsroom  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:55):**  podcast.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:24:56):**  I record with Ethan Soloveyev, but it's been funny to see some things called regenerative  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:02):**  that everybody can see has been very, very far from.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:07):**  And, you know, I mean, I applaud all efforts to reduce chemical use, even if it's not fully  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:12):**  organic any time, any time that you can reduce the amount of, you know, chemically.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:19):**  I'm all in favor of that.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:20):**  But the idea that that is regenerative, you know, is still a long ways from the intended  
**[0:25:27-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:27):**  use of the word.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:28):**  So unfortunately, you can't you can't patent words, you know, that already exist.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:33):**  But you came up with a term that was a new word, perhaps you could patent that.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:37):**  But so we do see increasingly the conventional folks trying to, you know, me too, these terms  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:46):**  which are popular with consumers.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:48):**  And do you see the market like straw?  
**[0:25:50-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:50):**  Do you see the main, let's say your current clients, your current companies that buy these  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:25:57):**  brokers, process brokers of you?  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:00):**  Is there another conversation compared to a year ago?  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:02):**  And is there interest in maybe this regenerative organic route or is there another route they're  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:07):**  interested in?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:08):**  Well, I'd say, again, it's slow to come.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:11):**  It is not it has not caught fire by any stretch of the imagination.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:15):**  But there's a there's a corner of the market that's interested in continuing to push for  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:19):**  cleaner and cleaner crops.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:22):**  And sometimes it's called regenerative.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:24):**  There's also been a significant movement, I think globally against pesticide residues.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:31):**  And so, you know, that doesn't it may not be directly addressed in the regenerative  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:37):**  label, so to speak.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:39):**  But I think, you know, with the recent court cases here in the U.S. about glyphosate poisoning  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:45):**  being awarded to individuals and with the I think the general understanding through  
**[0:26:50-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:50):**  testing that we're ingesting both through our food and our water, more more chemistry  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:57):**  than we imagined.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:26:59):**  We see certain markets headed in the direction of glyphosate free, for example, which isn't  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:06):**  isn't a regulated business model, but it means what it says.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:11):**  You cannot ship product into these markets, you know, with with glyphosate residues exceeding  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:17):**  a certain amount, if at all.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:19):**  And so that's going to continue to change the nature of the way in which certain areas  
**[0:27:25-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:25):**  grow crops, because their markets may demand that they ship residue free or minimal residue.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:33):**  And they don't fit neatly into the organic package.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:36):**  They don't fit neatly into the regenerative package.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:39):**  But it's a start.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:40):**  But it's a start.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:41):**  It's I see the attention with the court cases now and things like Zach Bush and  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:47):**  Farmer's Footprint that finally we're getting more attention for that.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:51):**  We've discussed water before actually a year ago and the state of the water pollution in  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:56):**  many, many farmers areas.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:27:58):**  And finally, we're starting to discuss way too late, obviously, but at least it's  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:02):**  discussed.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:03):**  At least the sources discussed, which is which is agriculture in many, many cases.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:06):**  Well, and it's interesting because if you take the long view and think about converging  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:11):**  concepts of, you know, some of the conversation that we've been seeing is headed towards,  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:17):**  you know, we spend this much money on chemicals and then we spend this much money on health  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:20):**  care.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:21):**  Right.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:22):**  And do the two have anything to do with each other?  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:25):**  And there's an increasing body of evidence and certainly an increasing conversation that  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:29):**  the two have everything to do with each other.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:31):**  Food is medicine.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:32):**  Food is medicine.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:33):**  I think the court artist said that.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:34):**  Right.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:35):**  Three thousand years ago or two and a half.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:38):**  And then, you know, water as well is, you know, to the point that you're making not  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:41):**  only not only farm chemicals and water, but pharmaceutical chemicals in the water.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:47):**  So there's an increasing understanding that taking care of the environment is a good business.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:52):**  But boy, there's an awful lot of money and effort being spent by the incumbents in the  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:28:57):**  space and the chemical and pharmaceutical industries to deny that there's any any issues  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:03):**  that, you know, that exist or that there's something that we should be doing about them.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:08):**  So it's going to be it's really at this point, the consumer against against industry, you  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:15):**  know, and that's pretty universal.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:16):**  It's not 100 percent the case, but it's it's pretty much going to be what's good for people  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:21):**  versus what's good for, you know, certain companies profits.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:24):**  And this is not going to be a battle that's going to be easily won until and unless the  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:29):**  consumers have clear options and they're willing to they're willing to, you know, make sure  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:33):**  that they take money out of their wallet only for things that support whatever their view  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:38):**  is of the marketplace.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:40):**  And it doesn't necessarily mean it has to be more expensive.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:43):**  You know, that's one of the other great myths is that everything has to be more expensive  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:46):**  if it's if it's not if it's not conventional.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:49):**  I think that that is maybe true in the short term.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:53):**  But the more that we can get, you know, better environmental practices on the farm, the more  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:29:59):**  universal that becomes.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:00):**  I don't think it necessarily leads to a higher cost of food.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:05):**  And the food is medicine, you know, particularly here in the U.S. where we spend so little  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:09):**  as a share of our wallet on food, if we spend a couple more points on good food, I think  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:16):**  the outcomes will be obvious.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:17):**  So you can see it coming.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:20):**  It's a you know, all these all these conversations are sort of heading, heading towards what  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:25):**  I hope is a common understanding that we are what we eat and that includes the environment.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:31):**  But you know, we've got many generations of common practices that we have to just be patient.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:39):**  We have to keep on pushing, but we have to understand that nothing's going to happen  
**[0:30:42-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:42):**  overnight.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:43):**  And actually, that's a perfect bridge to my final question.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:45):**  I asked it before and I want to see if your answer changed.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:49):**  Maybe the last year changed something on that.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:51):**  If you could change one thing overnight, if you could wave your magic wand and say, OK,  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:55):**  tomorrow morning, we'll wake up.  
**[0:30:57-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:57):**  What would it be?  
**[0:30:58-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:30:58):**  I don't remember what I said a year ago.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:00):**  I think at this point, I've become convinced that glyphosate as an herbicide and many of  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:08):**  the pesticides are much more toxic than we've understood in the past.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:14):**  I would do away with them.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:16):**  And I think that there's a short term reality to that.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:20):**  That means you have to manage things in a different way.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:22):**  But the longer term reality is that nature is adapting much more quickly than we can  
**[0:31:27-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:27):**  in the chemistry lab.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:29):**  And so all these pests that we've been fighting, particularly on the herbicides side of things,  
**[0:31:36-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:36):**  you know, these plants are becoming increasingly tolerant.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:39):**  You know, the same things happening in human medicine as well.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:42):**  Right.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:43):**  That's it's I think we have to be careful not to encourage Mother Nature to come out  
**[0:31:48-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:48):**  with her most recent version of tolerance strains of most recent dimensions.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:55):**  It could be very dangerous.  
**[0:31:58-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:31:59):**  Most recent that it can be very dangerous.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:00):**  So that that is, you know, I think in the last year in particular, that conversation  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:04):**  has me I'm happy that we're having a conversation.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:09):**  It's become such a constant conversation that you can't help but go to bed at night a little  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:13):**  bit worried about the state of things.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:16):**  So I would say getting rid of glyphosate and getting rid of, you know, certain classes  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:21):**  of pesticides would be probably my number one wish at this point.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:26):**  And I always do this.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:28):**  I ask a final question and then I come up with another one.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:31):**  How could people help you?  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:32):**  What could people I mean, there are quite some investors listening to the case, maybe  
**[0:32:37-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:37):**  not the size of a gravel bank and institutional investors like that.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:40):**  But it might have creativity or what would be something that people can help you and  
**[0:32:46-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:46):**  pipeline foods with, let's say in the next year?  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:49):**  You know, I think funding for good science is important.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:54):**  You know, we seem to have gotten ourselves to a point where we're sort of selectively  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:32:58):**  using science as a weapon.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:01):**  We've taken science out of the public domain and put it in the private domain.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:05):**  And the danger with that is that whoever funds whatever scientific experiment, of course,  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:11):**  gets the answer they're looking for.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:13):**  And that to me is extremely dangerous.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:15):**  So I would say funding for, you know, public funding for research so that science has an  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:22):**  objective voice in these conversations is ultimately going to be the most critical path  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:27):**  forward.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:28):**  And it's not hard for us to find publicly funded research anymore on some of these topics  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:32):**  because it simply has been defunded and put in the private domain.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:33:38):**  And with that, I cannot agree more, obviously.

**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:36:39):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture

**[0:37:10-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:37:10):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:37:12):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.

**[0:37:18-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/#t=0:37:18):**  It's also not investment advice.

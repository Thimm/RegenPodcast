    ### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2019-03-26)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:14):**  Ultimately, I'm committed to building ecology, profitability and beauty on farms around the  world and that's what drives me to do what I do every day.  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:30-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:30):**  planet mattered.  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:41):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:51):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors big and small  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:08):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:20):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:33):**  support me and make this happen.  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  And now without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:44):**  Enjoy.  You're going to listen to an interview with Abby Rose on the role of farmers first technology  in the regenerative agriculture and food transition and how it won't save us all, but it's absolutely  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:55):**  crucial to empower farmers.  Welcome to the podcast.  I'm Koon Vassaiyan, your host.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:00):**  And today I'm joined by Abby Rose.  She's the co-host of Farmerama, the monthly podcast sharing the voices of small scale  farmers in the UK and beyond and a natural wine producer and farmer with her family in  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:11):**  Chile.  But last and not least, she's also the co-founder of Vida Cycle, a tech company focused on small  and medium scale farmers.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:17):**  Welcome Abby.  Thanks.  Thank you.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:20):**  So first up a personal question, how do you end up in Chile and how do you end up working  the soil and in a natural wine company?  Big question.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:31):**  So my parents moved to Chile when I was just at university and my parents are both originally  from California.  And so they were looking to return to a farming based business and they wanted to find a similar  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:47):**  climate to California.  And so Chile is a very, where we are in Chile is a very similar climate and kind of terrain  to California, but on the other side of the equator.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:59):**  So it kind of made sense to go to Chile.  Also we knew a few people in Chile and they helped us find a piece of land that was actually  that neighbor to their farm.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:08):**  So that worked very well.  They're a local Chilean couple who make wine here.  And so it just all kind of fell into place quite naturally.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:17):**  And that's how we're here.  And we've been here over 10 years now up in the coastal hills, about three hours or three  and a half hours south of Santiago, about halfway between the Andes and the ocean.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:30):**  And it's very, very dry here.  We have about less than 800 millimeters of rainfall each year.  It depends.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:37):**  Last year we had 400.  So we're kind of in a drought this year.  And you really feel living here on the land that resources like water and soil, the pressure  
**[0:03:48-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:48):**  is becoming ever higher and you really need to build a landscape that is resilient and  that can have an ecosystem that sort of survives on its own.  So the soil holds the water all year round and it holds every drop of water that comes  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:05):**  down.  And I think that's how I really got into soil was actually by being here on the land and  looking and seeing that things weren't working.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:17):**  We had a massive fire come through in 2017.  It was totally devastating.  I mean, the fire burned over a million acres.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:27):**  So we were small collateral, but our 8,000 olive trees, they all burned.  And I would say now two years on, probably only a thousand of them are still going to  be producing fruit in the next five years.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:46):**  So that's a pretty serious hit because 2017 was going to be our first ever olive harvest.  So devastating as a farm.  But then you start to think and you look around and you say, well, why did everything burn?  
**[0:05:01-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:01):**  And really it's a lot to do and going forward, how can we have a farm here if fire is always  going to be a threat?  There's always going to be more fires.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:12):**  So we need to create a farming landscape that is essentially fire friendly, basically.  And that's what we're aiming to do today.  And that's where we've started to really focus on soil health and how to rebuild soils.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:28):**  And so we've taken steps.  We've got our first few sheep here.  We're mob grazing them, moving them around regularly.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:36):**  We've allowed some of the grasses to grow quite tall this year to see if we can get  better root penetration.  And everything we do now is all about how can we build the soil health and how can we  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:47):**  make this farm fire friendly?  Does that answer your question?  Yeah.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:51):**  When did you see that connection between soil health and fire friendly, which I love as  a term, it sounds a bit too friendly maybe.  I know.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:59):**  Such a destructive force, but where did that connection or what was, was there a moment  that you discovered or saw that, okay, we need to build, rebuild the soil here to actually  be more resilient against fires and more fire friendly?  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:13):**  Yeah.  So, well, I guess it was, you know, the idea of a fire burning over a million acres, that's  insane.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:21):**  And that fire took out whole thousand person villages in a night.  So that's what you call us as a super fire, right?  And those kinds of fires are relatively recent phenomenon.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:36):**  We've always had forest fires, obviously, but for them to burn that quickly with that  intensity and be so out of control, it's not natural in that sense.  It's actually manmade.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:46):**  And, you know, you can read around and like we're surrounded by, there's 14,000 hectares  of pine forest here.  Really has a bit of a complicated recent history with pine companies or paper and wood companies.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:02):**  But anyway, so there's this 14,000 hectares of pines and it's a total monoculture.  And so when a fire comes, it rips through that monoculture like nothing else.  And we actually have a native forest as part of our land.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:16):**  We have a few hundred hectares of native forest on our land and the fire actually petered  out when it went through that native forest.  So we're actually the edge of this million acres of fire.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:27):**  So you can see that I would say the intensity and the degree of these fires are manmade.  And so that's where we started to think, okay, well, to make something fire friendly, we  need to start looking to soils that it needs to have moisture in the soil so that you can  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:47):**  have crops or grasses that are green all year round because then they don't burn in the  same way and increasing the diversity on the land.  Having trees that are able to retain water better, you know, pines are actually quite  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:03):**  extractive as a tree, especially when they're planted at that scale.  So it was kind of through that journey that we came to soil health as being the key to  a more resilient farm.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:17):**  And also, you know, the reality is that soil as a living system is a massive buffer because  it is incredible at retaining water.  It's also incredible at infiltrating or allowing water to percolate through.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:33):**  And both of those qualities, you know, whether it's drought or flood or fire, they're really  important in order for a functioning farming system.  Definitely.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:43):**  Yeah.  Do you see a connection now with the quality of your produce in this case, the wine, I  mean, or has it been too short for that?  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:52):**  Do you see like better soil health leads to better produce in this case?  I would say this timeline is way too short.  We're just about so since the fire, we haven't harvested anything since the fire because  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:04):**  nothing has fruited.  So we're just literally later this week going to do our first harvest of grapes.  So we'll let you know.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:12):**  To be continued.  Yeah, exactly.  So, but what I would say is that inevitably, if you start by looking at the soil and regenerating  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:22):**  the soil system, that's just the base of, to me, an ecological system.  So when you have a very well functioning soil, then you have healthier plants and then they're  less prone to attacks from different pests or diseases.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:39):**  So it is all like a, once you get the soil in motion and working, it seems to be that  it's just a system that works and therefore you do get higher quality produce.  And a lot of people, and you know, I've been tuning into different people talking about  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:56):**  the microbiome of the soil and that if you have a very diverse microbial life in there,  that that is potentially reflected in its nutritive value for human beings in terms  of that it might also affect our microbiome.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:14):**  Yeah.  I'm actually planning a series on that.  I think it's one of the key connections to help accelerate the regenerative ag and food  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:24):**  movement and the soil movement.  Yeah.  No, I think it's really interesting.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:28):**  I think amazingly, when you talk to a lot of farmers, you know, we have all these issues  around like organic or what label do you have or what label are you using for your farming  style?  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:41):**  And there's all sorts of elitism wrapped into that, but almost every farmer you talk to  wants to produce food of higher nutritive value.  Like that is important to them.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:54):**  And that's cool.  I completely agree.  But I also see it goes against such a big system of certification and a big system of  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:01):**  farming that it's going to be quite an interesting battle if we're going to select on nutrient  per acre instead of yield per acre or kilos or tons, et cetera, to see what's going to  happen and what's going to be the differences between certain farming systems, because we  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:15):**  can hopefully with that, finally compare them on something that's important to, in this  case, it seems all including the farmers.  So that's going to be very exciting.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:24):**  I think it's going to be quite, quite interesting to see how the supermarkets or how the shells  or the where you get your food in the farmers markets change because these tomatoes seem  the same.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:33):**  They have the same color of red and the same color, et cetera, but they are actually not  because the nutrient content could be a factor 20 different.  Yeah, I actually like that.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:41):**  I still worry about any single measure like that because I feel like single measures are  what can really lead us down a path of not understanding the whole picture.  And I'm going to contradict myself here and say that if I was to have a single measure,  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:00):**  I think my measure would always be diversity.  I feel like that is what underpins the most effective way of understanding if a system  is contributing to the earth, to people, to health or not.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:17):**  I agree because it would be great to have these nutrient meters, but then what is good  and what is not, and what's going to be good for you and what do these numbers actually  mean?  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:27):**  Which is something, I mean, we don't even know how to come up with a diet that works,  let alone a nutrient based one.  So that's going to be very interesting and it's going to be a lot of blah, blah, blah  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:38):**  around to hopefully get to some proxies or at least some indications of what works for  at least us and soil.  And so how did, I mean, the focus has been soil, I think also already before, because  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:51):**  you were building a natural wine company, which have the name at least to be focused  on soil more than a chemical based wine company.  How did it lead to founding a tech company from within basically?  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:13:04):**  What was the need you saw and it got you to focus on that?  So originally we planted 8,000 olive trees and each year we were having frost damage  issues on a few hundred trees and it really wasn't clear whether it was the same trees  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:13:24):**  year after year or maybe different ones.  And then it becomes very difficult to manage because you don't know if it's just a weak  tree and you need to pull it out and change it or if it's just kind of random and some  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:13:40):**  years one gets hit worse than the other and there's nothing you can do about it.  And so because of these kinds of questions, I studied physics at university, so I know  how to code and my dad was telling me about his, the problems with the olives.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:13:54):**  And so we came up with a system using RFID tags or contactless tags on each tree that  allowed us to record, we could take photos, we could record if there was a problem that  happened with a specific tree or if a tree had frost damage and then we could go and  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:12):**  look which trees had frost damage one year, which had them the next.  And then we could actually start to make some decisions about how to manage those trees  going forward.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:20):**  You know, it's amazing how of course you can walk around the trees, but you just can't  remember everything obviously.  No, and even, I mean with 8,000, which is a lot and not a lot at the same time compared  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:33):**  to some other farms, but you don't, you'll never remember because they're 8,000 like  eight.  Okay.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:40):**  You can still do something, but beyond that, beyond a hundred, it just becomes too complex.  And this was some simple between brackets, RFID tags and an app basically became a data  rich olive farm compared to a data poor one.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:54):**  Exactly.  And then you can, it just completely transforms how you make management decisions.  I mean, even after the fire came through, we were then able to go through and log, okay,  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:05):**  well what state is each tree in?  And then we had some numbers and we could see, well, how do we move forward from here?  And it was pretty clear that we needed to move some trees and replant them in a certain  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:20):**  area and then just really put our time and effort into those trees and not worry about  others that were more badly hit.  So it really does help in that sense.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:31):**  And I mean, that's great.  I think many farms, not many farms, there are a number of farmers that invented something  for their farm, but then to turn that into a company and actually sharing it, or in this  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:43):**  case selling it to others, to outside clients is quite a step.  What made you do that?  Well, part of what made us do it is that our neighbors became interested and started asking,  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:53):**  oh, well actually for my blueberry farm, I need this.  And so then, you know, I was doing all this in my spare time.  So the demand on my time came more and more and that was why.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:06):**  But I guess fundamentally why is because for me, you know, here in Chile I get filled with  hope because I visit so many small to medium scale farms that are totally commercially  viable.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:20):**  So the blueberries we eat in the UK are exported.  I've been to different blueberry farms here that export to the UK and they're like wonderful  farms.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:30):**  They have great workers and they kind of, you know, manage everything in a very ecological  way.  And it just fills me with hope that actually these are the farmers feeding the world.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:43):**  Obviously blueberries is a expensive crop, but just to say that small to medium scale  farms exist and they are in many ways a majority.  And the more that we can do to support them to be able to compete going forward and to  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:01):**  thrive going forward, I think that that's a really positive future for everyone.  And so that was why I really decided that actually, you know, if we can really bring  some value here by having a technology that works, it's very simple.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:18):**  You know, anyone on the farm pretty much can use it.  You don't have to be trained in technology and they don't need to hire a tech specialist  to have it work on their farm.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:27):**  And it brings value and it saves time and it allows people to bring transparency to  their workers or bring transparency to what's happening in the field.  And that, you know, most businesses today use data in some way and I don't see why we  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:42):**  should, well, obviously small to medium scale farms will benefit from small amounts of data  and that's really where I'm focused.  And that sort of suggests that it wasn't there.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:53):**  So medium and small medium scale farmers obviously have a need for better data to understand  because their scale might be smaller, but doesn't mean they can remember everything.  But you would guess or imagine from somebody from the outside like myself that there would  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:08):**  be technology solutions and that you wouldn't have to code this in your spare time basically  on the side.  Yeah.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:16):**  So, so we looked around for systems and I guess the problem was that there were, there  were certainly companies out there that were offering technologies, but custom build technologies.  So that's really much more focused on, you know, companies who have a lot of capital  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:32):**  to spend on developing a technology specifically for their farm.  Or we did find some things out there, but they were literally running on windows 95  and you had to have a special proprietary machine to do it.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:44):**  And an old windows phone.  Yeah, exactly.  And it was just like, this is going to waste time, not save time.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:51):**  Like if you know, amazingly here in Chile, many people, I mean, they sort of have quite  amazing systems, but they, you know, they've got like poker chips to keep track of who's  harvesting what in terms of blueberries.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:05):**  And then it's all written down in notebooks.  And then someone at the end of the day types it all up into a spreadsheet.  So you can see that even the simplest of data collection tools are not in use.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:21):**  And I don't know.  I mean, maybe those tools do exist.  We certainly couldn't find them, but I do think the other side to it is reaching farmers  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:28):**  is difficult as well.  Yeah, because that would be my next question is how, how has it been so far?  What has been the response from the market, which is you just said difficult to reach,  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:40):**  not interested, I can imagine in doing things easier, but farmers also have the name of  not being the most technology forward and fast movers as they have a lot to risk and  usually quite thin margins.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:51):**  How has been the response from your clients?  Yes.  Well, so I mean, I obviously were operating in Chile and the UK and a little bit in Europe  
**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:03):**  and then just starting to in the U S as well.  And each of those markets is slightly different and their response is slightly different.  But let me talk a little bit about each one.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:12):**  So in Chile, we work with a number of different small scale farmers.  And I would say that in Chile, people are very open here.  The farmers are seen still as entrepreneurs and pioneers.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:28):**  You know, you can still make some good money being a farmer here.  And so why do you say still?  Well, if I just compare it to the UK market where I feel like most farms are either, you  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:45):**  know, if they're small, they're struggling to just make ends meet or they've gone to  a larger scale and in Chile that's different, very different here.  Most of the farms we work with are between 10 to 30 hectares in England.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:59):**  That's small, but even the fact that the farm is making that much money, that's just very  different to the UK.  In my experience,  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:08):**  It would be a whole, it would be a whole different podcast to unpack that probably to understand  if it's a sustainable thing as in they're not extracting these returns from the soil  or not as we've done here, obviously.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:21):**  And now we're running on a much literally thinner, thinner layer, or is it management  or climate or better margins and markets or better methods?  There will be other costs structures.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:34):**  I mean, probably a combination of these, but it would be interesting to pack, but let's  go back to the response of your clients there in Chile.  Yeah.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:43):**  So, okay.  So in Chile, you know, I visited a few clients since I've been here and all of them just  say like, this is so exciting.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:52):**  It's really helped us.  It's really transformed how we can operate in terms of, you know, the workers are happier.  They can see more what's going on each day.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:01):**  And I, it saves me loads of time, you know, sign me up and they're just excited to move  forward.  So it's generally been very positive and there are actually now in the marketplace, there  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:11):**  are quite a few competitors also doing what we're doing here.  And that's only happened, I say in the last year and a half, two years.  Oh, wow.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:20):**  So you spurred an industry.  Yeah.  Whereas in the UK, we mainly work with vineyards, but then also, uh, general farmers on soil  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:31):**  health as well.  And to me in the UK, it's all about, uh, actually in farming in general, it's all about working  with farming organizations and building trust and for people to build case studies so that  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:47):**  people start to really understand what the benefits are.  And that's, that's been our whole approach.  And so for example, we only just started, we only launched the soils out just over a  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:56):**  year ago now, a year and two months ago.  So the case studies are just starting to build and we're just starting to see a growth in  people start using the soils app now.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:09):**  And can you explain a bit what the soil app is?  As it's different than the, the, the tree monitoring one or the sector monitoring one  you mentioned.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:19):**  Yeah.  So the soils app, it's called sector mentor for soils.  And it's all about enabling farmers to go out and look at their own soils and understand  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:32):**  if their soils are healthier or not.  And so we, we worked together with the pasture fed livestock association and a soils advisors,  I'm sorry, a soils advisor called Niels Corfield and a soil scientist called Jenny Dungate.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:48):**  And we put together a series of protocols that are just a series of different tests,  very simple tests that you can use kind of any equipment from around the farm to do.  So one of them is just a simple earthworm count.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:04):**  We have something called the wet aggregate stability test or the slate test, which allows  you to see how soil breaks down under water.  And the key to all of the tests is that they are different ways of indicating how alive  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:19):**  your soil system is.  So that's really what we're testing.  And in a way you can't test that very easily in a lab test.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:25):**  You really have to go look and many soil scientists will even say that one of the best ways to  understand your soils is to go and look and see what's going on.  So with our app, it enables you to easily record what you're seeing as you see them.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:41):**  And if you're counting earthworms, you can record that for each field.  And then when you go back home, you can see, you know, the field that I tried mob grazing  in has my earthworm count gone up since last year or not?  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:54):**  Is my soil structure more stable or not?  And therefore from those trends, you can start to see which of your kind of experiments to  build soil health are working better or not.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:05):**  Which is hugely liberating because before you need it or pay a soil scientist to come  which then maybe told you go and look or send a lot of samples to a very, very expensive  lab and you don't even know.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:19):**  I mean, you know that the data that comes back, but obviously you couldn't do it for  all your fields, let alone multiple pieces of your field.  And you need to do it every year or even twice a year to build up that record.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:30):**  And like with the trees, see if they suffer every year from frost damage and might be  time to cut or in this case might be time to change the management system.  Exactly.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:39):**  Yeah.  So I think what's fundamental to all of our technology, it's about empowering farmers.  And this tool is all about recognizing that farmers are perfectly capable of understanding  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:53):**  how soil works.  They know kind of the system and the idea that someone else needs to tell them how to  manage their soil.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:02):**  I just think that's not, it's not very empowering and it's not really the best way to do things  because actually the farmers are the people who are on their land all the time looking  anyway.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:13):**  So they actually have some of the best insights about what's really going on.  So by enabling farmers to go and feel confident looking at their soils for themselves, you  know, we have seen farmers just get so excited about that.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:30):**  One farmer, Fidelity Weston, you know, she has been farming for over 30 years and she's  a very ecologically minded organic farmer, pasture for life certified.  And she had, you know, in the 30 years of farming never looked at her soil in this way,  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:45):**  she said.  And she got so excited.  And since then she's been doing tests, I'd say every six to eight months looking at how  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:53):**  she's experimenting with mob grazing.  And so she's looking at how that is affecting certain fields that she really wanted to build  up the forage on as well as build biodiversity on her farm in general, because that's really  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:06):**  her driving force is to ensure that the diversity stays high while she's mob grazing.  And is she seeing results or is it too early for that as you launched the app about a year  and two months ago?  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:18):**  Exactly.  So I say that's one of the most difficult things about taking to market.  And I would say this is generally true of farming technologies is that it takes time  
**[0:27:29-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:29):**  because in order to see results, I mean, you do start to see some very, very basic results  in soils if you are quite proactive about soil health.  So like you change your grazing and maybe you put in a cover crop and do a few other  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:47):**  things.  But you know that that change that you'll see is just maybe a few centimeters deeper  having lots of roots and better soil structure, or you might have a slightly faster infiltration  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:01):**  rate.  But to see like real results will take, I'd say two to three years.  Which is in the life of a farmer, nothing.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:10):**  So exactly.  For a tech company, that's a lifetime.  Exactly.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:15):**  Like tech companies are made, sold or die in that time.  So it is very, very different.  And working with agricultural cycles in some ways is a real constraint.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:28):**  And in other ways I find it wonderful because it really draws you back to the rhythm of  life and where technology and life come together.  And I think that's, yeah, to me that's a really exciting thing to explore.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:45):**  What is that point?  What is that, you know, what's the tension there?  And how can we make the two work together in a way that builds ecosystems and doesn't  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:56):**  destroy them?  So yeah, I'm always playing with that tension slash symbiosis.  And what do you see ahead if we would interview, we do this interview again in a year from  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:10):**  now, it's now March 2019.  What do you see the next 12 months for the tech company?  Well, the thing I'm really excited about right now is that I was just at the Oregon Wine  
**[0:29:22-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:22):**  Symposium and I was talking about using SectorMentor for vines in order to, the same soil test.  You can use them in a vineyard and that can tell you how resilient your soil is in your  vineyard and how much you're building soil health in the vineyard.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:40):**  And what's interesting about Oregon is that it's a slightly, it's a younger wine industry  than California, for example, but it's certainly growing and it's exciting that they have a  lot of small to medium scale family vineyard operations there.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:56):**  And so it means that there's actually quite an appetite for innovation and also they have  a strong, and Oregonians traditionally always have had a strong emphasis on ecology and  being ecological.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:10):**  And so they are doing some amazing things there, some of the vineyards we're working  with there now.  So for me in a year's time, where we'll be is that we'll have started working with these  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:25):**  vineyards in Oregon, a lady called Mimi Castile at Hopewell Wine together with her and a few  others will have started a kind of ecological vineyard revolution.  And I think that that is very exciting.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:40):**  Very interesting.  And if you look at the sector and the sector is much, much bigger, obviously the agriculture  and food sector, if you look at from the investing or the investor perspective, and you're looking  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:53):**  obviously as a tech company, but also as a farmer and a natural winemaker does also processing  or selling produce, what do you see as the biggest barriers to make to let this sector  reach a scale, obviously an appropriate scale to have a bigger impact, like to have much  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:09):**  more land being fire friendly to have stopped some of these fires?  What do you see as the biggest barriers for the sector to really grow and reach its potential  impact?  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:19):**  From an investor's perspective, right?  Or from yours.  But if you imagine there's a there's a room full of impact investors listening, and we  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:26):**  can go into advice later, not investment advice, but what you would do if you would be an investor.  But let's start from your your perspective as a on the land and the technology company.  What do you see as the biggest barriers?  
**[0:31:37-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:37):**  Well, one thing that I have no answer to, and it sort of keeps me up at night is, is  the problem of food prices.  And that food is so cheap, and is in a way, you know, I just don't know how to get around  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:58):**  that, because the truth is, is food is not cheap.  And that there's a huge amount of risk involved in farming.  And that there are always years where things don't work out, or a fire comes, and you just  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:09):**  can't avoid that.  So the fact that farmers are the people who are like some of the least, or some of the  people really struggling, to me that that is at the core of being or that is a big issue  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:26):**  about going forward and what sustainable or an ecological future looks like is that we  need to find a way to have it be that farmers can make decisions that are for ecology and  profitability and that the two are aligned.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:44):**  And if you could wave your magic wand and change something overnight, would it be something  on food prices?  Yeah, I guess, if I was to change something overnight, I would just bring into place.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:56):**  Oh, man, I forgot the name of it right now.  One second.  Okay.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:03):**  True Cost Accounting System, basically, because then the no longer would food prices hide  the true costs.  And then, you know, suddenly, like food produced regeneratively would be cheaper than food  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:17):**  produced by large scale agriculture.  That's extremely extractive, and it would just transform the system.  And a final question, I think it's a great answer to the question, a final question.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:31):**  Let's go back to the room full of impact investors that are listening and are super excited about  soil and are excited about tech, but farmers first tech, obviously, what would be your  advice if they haven't made investments in the Regen Ag and food space, not giving investment  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:46):**  advice, but where would you urge them to start reading, to start exploring or to start putting  their money to work?  Wow.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:53):**  Okay.  I think they should listen to Farmerama.  And I guess my advice, and I mean, maybe this isn't many investors appetite, but is to go  
**[0:34:09-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:34:09):**  and work on some farms and understand the reality of farming, because until you really  understand the risks involved, the difficulties day to day, why farmers make the decisions  they do, I think it's very hard to try and transform the system.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:34:31):**  For example, it's easy to say, oh, well, farmers shouldn't cut down trees because that could  cause flooding in the next town.  But if the farmer had a drought last year and didn't get any of their wheat crop that  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:34:43):**  they normally get, then they may have to cut down those trees in order to sell the timber  to have their business survive or send their kids to school.  So I think actually working on the front line is part of the key of understanding the system.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:00):**  But obviously not everyone has an appetite to do that or the time.  So the next best thing would be to read books like Leah Penniman's Farming While Black,  brilliant book, Masanobu Fukuoka's The One Straw Revolution, Gabe Brown's Dirt to Soil.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:19):**  What else have I read recently that's brilliant?  Soil by Woody Tash, also brilliant.  I was going to say it.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:28):**  We have a signed copy.  Excellent.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:31):**  And I guess also to go with, yeah, it is, if you can't take time to work on farms, then  go and talk to farmers.  I think one of the biggest issues right now is that a lot of investors see an easy way  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:45):**  to invest in regenerative agriculture is through technology as a channel.  I would say that's a cop out personally.  So here I am, a technology developer saying that's a cop out, but it is.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:58):**  Technology is not going to save us in my view.  And what will save us is changing mindsets and is working with people.  And technology is a tool that will aid people.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:12):**  So to really have impact, I think what we need to look into is training, is to build  case study farms that people could come visit and learn from.  The other aspect to it is creating land trusts and building or having areas of land that  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:33):**  people can rent for reasonable prices and farm in a regenerative way.  All those kinds of things are, there's lots of ways to get involved, but the only thing  I would say is, please don't just go invest in a random technology that's going to save  
**[0:36:47-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:47):**  us all.  Yeah.  And I think if you are that interested in food and agriculture and in the system a few  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:54):**  weeks or a month or working on a farm, is that really such an investment?  I mean, you can read at night and you can, but to understand the difficulties, you don't  need to do 10 seasons.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:07):**  Nobody's forcing you to do that, but at least have an understanding of in high season, obviously,  of what's happening on local farms or on a farm somewhere else.  I think it's not too much to ask from anyone wanting to put money to work and also making  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:22):**  decisions that affect a lot of people.  And it's very difficult to make those if you have no idea who those people actually are.  Totally.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:30):**  Couldn't agree more.  So I want to thank you so much for your time and I will definitely be checking in with  you on the company and obviously how it's going with the olive trees that got burned,  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:43):**  but hopefully some of them survive and how the Oregon wine industry is responding to  the technology to really empower them instead of disempowering them.  Yeah.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:55):**  Great.  Well, thank you so much.  I think, you know, this is so important to be, uh, what the work you're doing to really  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:38:02):**  connect the investment realm with the food and farming world.  It seems like there's ever increasing demand.  And so the more we can talk the same language and share the stories, the better off we'll  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:38:14):**  be.  So thank you for this.  Brilliant.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:38:17):**  Thank you so much.  And I was very happy when farmer, which is definitely one of my favorite podcasts was  sharing a small story.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:38:23):**  I did a, I think a year and a half ago on one farmer in our farmer community actually  in, uh, in the Netherlands.  So we had some cross sharing before.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:38:32):**  Yeah, no, that was brilliant.  We loved that.  We loved that whole story.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:38:37):**  So it was great.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.

Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:39:53):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question,  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:40:02):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:40:15-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:40:15):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  
**[0:40:24-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:40:24):**  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?  
**[0:40:27-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:40:27):**  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:40:32):**  You the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:40:47):**  designers, holistic management consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  
**[0:40:58-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:40:58):**  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  et cetera.  Is this course free?  
**[0:41:06-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:41:06):**  No, this is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:41:18-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:41:18):**  different means.  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:41:27):**  Thank you.  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:41:35):**  So you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:41:48):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:41:59-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:41:59):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  
**[0:42:08-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:42:08):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:42:17):**  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on

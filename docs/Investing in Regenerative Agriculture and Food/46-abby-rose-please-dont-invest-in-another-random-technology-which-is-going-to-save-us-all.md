**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:14):**  Ultimately, I'm committed to building ecology, profitability and beauty on farms around the  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:20):**  world and that's what drives me to do what I do every day.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:25):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:30-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:30):**  planet mattered.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:31):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:36):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:41):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:45):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:48):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:51):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors big and small  
**[0:00:57-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:00:57):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:04):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:08):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:11):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:15):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:20):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:24):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:29):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:33):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:50):**  in the regenerative agriculture and food transition and how it won't save us all, but it's absolutely  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:55):**  crucial to empower farmers.  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:01:58):**  Welcome to the podcast.

**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:00):**  And today I'm joined by Abby Rose.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:02):**  She's the co-host of Farmerama, the monthly podcast sharing the voices of small scale  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:06):**  farmers in the UK and beyond and a natural wine producer and farmer with her family in  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:11):**  Chile.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:12):**  But last and not least, she's also the co-founder of Vida Cycle, a tech company focused on small  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:16):**  and medium scale farmers.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:17):**  Welcome Abby.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:18):**  Thanks.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:19):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:20):**  So first up a personal question, how do you end up in Chile and how do you end up working  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:25):**  the soil and in a natural wine company?  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:29):**  Big question.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:31):**  So my parents moved to Chile when I was just at university and my parents are both originally  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:40):**  from California.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:42):**  And so they were looking to return to a farming based business and they wanted to find a similar  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:47):**  climate to California.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:49):**  And so Chile is a very, where we are in Chile is a very similar climate and kind of terrain  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:55):**  to California, but on the other side of the equator.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:02:59):**  So it kind of made sense to go to Chile.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:01):**  Also we knew a few people in Chile and they helped us find a piece of land that was actually  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:06):**  that neighbor to their farm.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:08):**  So that worked very well.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:09):**  They're a local Chilean couple who make wine here.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:13):**  And so it just all kind of fell into place quite naturally.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:17):**  And that's how we're here.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:18):**  And we've been here over 10 years now up in the coastal hills, about three hours or three  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:25):**  and a half hours south of Santiago, about halfway between the Andes and the ocean.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:30):**  And it's very, very dry here.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:33):**  We have about less than 800 millimeters of rainfall each year.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:36):**  It depends.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:37):**  Last year we had 400.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:38):**  So we're kind of in a drought this year.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:41):**  And you really feel living here on the land that resources like water and soil, the pressure  
**[0:03:48-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:48):**  is becoming ever higher and you really need to build a landscape that is resilient and  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:03:55):**  that can have an ecosystem that sort of survives on its own.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:00):**  So the soil holds the water all year round and it holds every drop of water that comes  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:05):**  down.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:06):**  And I think that's how I really got into soil was actually by being here on the land and  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:13):**  looking and seeing that things weren't working.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:17):**  We had a massive fire come through in 2017.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:21):**  It was totally devastating.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:23):**  I mean, the fire burned over a million acres.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:27):**  So we were small collateral, but our 8,000 olive trees, they all burned.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:35):**  And I would say now two years on, probably only a thousand of them are still going to  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:43):**  be producing fruit in the next five years.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:46):**  So that's a pretty serious hit because 2017 was going to be our first ever olive harvest.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:52):**  So devastating as a farm.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:04:56):**  But then you start to think and you look around and you say, well, why did everything burn?  
**[0:05:01-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:01):**  And really it's a lot to do and going forward, how can we have a farm here if fire is always  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:09):**  going to be a threat?  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:10):**  There's always going to be more fires.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:12):**  So we need to create a farming landscape that is essentially fire friendly, basically.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:20):**  And that's what we're aiming to do today.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:22):**  And that's where we've started to really focus on soil health and how to rebuild soils.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:28):**  And so we've taken steps.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:29):**  We've got our first few sheep here.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:32):**  We're mob grazing them, moving them around regularly.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:36):**  We've allowed some of the grasses to grow quite tall this year to see if we can get  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:41):**  better root penetration.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:43):**  And everything we do now is all about how can we build the soil health and how can we  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:47):**  make this farm fire friendly?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:49):**  Does that answer your question?  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:51):**  When did you see that connection between soil health and fire friendly, which I love as  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:56):**  a term, it sounds a bit too friendly maybe.  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:58):**  I know.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:05:59):**  Such a destructive force, but where did that connection or what was, was there a moment  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:05):**  that you discovered or saw that, okay, we need to build, rebuild the soil here to actually  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:10):**  be more resilient against fires and more fire friendly?  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:14):**  So, well, I guess it was, you know, the idea of a fire burning over a million acres, that's  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:20):**  insane.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:21):**  And that fire took out whole thousand person villages in a night.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:26):**  So that's what you call us as a super fire, right?  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:30):**  And those kinds of fires are relatively recent phenomenon.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:36):**  We've always had forest fires, obviously, but for them to burn that quickly with that  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:41):**  intensity and be so out of control, it's not natural in that sense.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:45):**  It's actually manmade.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:46):**  And, you know, you can read around and like we're surrounded by, there's 14,000 hectares  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:53):**  of pine forest here.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:06:55):**  Really has a bit of a complicated recent history with pine companies or paper and wood companies.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:02):**  But anyway, so there's this 14,000 hectares of pines and it's a total monoculture.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:08):**  And so when a fire comes, it rips through that monoculture like nothing else.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:13):**  And we actually have a native forest as part of our land.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:16):**  We have a few hundred hectares of native forest on our land and the fire actually petered  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:20):**  out when it went through that native forest.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:23):**  So we're actually the edge of this million acres of fire.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:27):**  So you can see that I would say the intensity and the degree of these fires are manmade.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:34):**  And so that's where we started to think, okay, well, to make something fire friendly, we  
**[0:07:39-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:39):**  need to start looking to soils that it needs to have moisture in the soil so that you can  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:47):**  have crops or grasses that are green all year round because then they don't burn in the  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:53):**  same way and increasing the diversity on the land.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:07:57):**  Having trees that are able to retain water better, you know, pines are actually quite  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:03):**  extractive as a tree, especially when they're planted at that scale.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:09):**  So it was kind of through that journey that we came to soil health as being the key to  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:16):**  a more resilient farm.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:17):**  And also, you know, the reality is that soil as a living system is a massive buffer because  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:24):**  it is incredible at retaining water.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:28):**  It's also incredible at infiltrating or allowing water to percolate through.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:33):**  And both of those qualities, you know, whether it's drought or flood or fire, they're really  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:39):**  important in order for a functioning farming system.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:42):**  Definitely.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:44):**  Do you see a connection now with the quality of your produce in this case, the wine, I  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:50):**  mean, or has it been too short for that?  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:52):**  Do you see like better soil health leads to better produce in this case?  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:56):**  I would say this timeline is way too short.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:08:58):**  We're just about so since the fire, we haven't harvested anything since the fire because  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:04):**  nothing has fruited.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:05):**  So we're just literally later this week going to do our first harvest of grapes.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:10):**  So we'll let you know.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:12):**  To be continued.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:13):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:14):**  So, but what I would say is that inevitably, if you start by looking at the soil and regenerating  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:22):**  the soil system, that's just the base of, to me, an ecological system.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:27):**  So when you have a very well functioning soil, then you have healthier plants and then they're  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:35):**  less prone to attacks from different pests or diseases.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:39):**  So it is all like a, once you get the soil in motion and working, it seems to be that  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:44):**  it's just a system that works and therefore you do get higher quality produce.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:50):**  And a lot of people, and you know, I've been tuning into different people talking about  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:09:56):**  the microbiome of the soil and that if you have a very diverse microbial life in there,  
**[0:10:03-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:03):**  that that is potentially reflected in its nutritive value for human beings in terms  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:10):**  of that it might also affect our microbiome.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:15):**  I'm actually planning a series on that.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:17):**  I think it's one of the key connections to help accelerate the regenerative ag and food  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:24):**  movement and the soil movement.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:27):**  No, I think it's really interesting.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:28):**  I think amazingly, when you talk to a lot of farmers, you know, we have all these issues  
**[0:10:33-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:33):**  around like organic or what label do you have or what label are you using for your farming  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:40):**  style?  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:41):**  And there's all sorts of elitism wrapped into that, but almost every farmer you talk to  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:47):**  wants to produce food of higher nutritive value.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:51):**  Like that is important to them.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:54):**  And that's cool.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:55):**  I completely agree.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:10:56):**  But I also see it goes against such a big system of certification and a big system of  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:01):**  farming that it's going to be quite an interesting battle if we're going to select on nutrient  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:05):**  per acre instead of yield per acre or kilos or tons, et cetera, to see what's going to  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:10):**  happen and what's going to be the differences between certain farming systems, because we  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:15):**  can hopefully with that, finally compare them on something that's important to, in this  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:19):**  case, it seems all including the farmers.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:22):**  So that's going to be very exciting.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:24):**  I think it's going to be quite, quite interesting to see how the supermarkets or how the shells  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:28):**  or the where you get your food in the farmers markets change because these tomatoes seem  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:32):**  the same.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:33):**  They have the same color of red and the same color, et cetera, but they are actually not  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:36):**  because the nutrient content could be a factor 20 different.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:39):**  Yeah, I actually like that.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:41):**  I still worry about any single measure like that because I feel like single measures are  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:50):**  what can really lead us down a path of not understanding the whole picture.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:11:56):**  And I'm going to contradict myself here and say that if I was to have a single measure,  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:00):**  I think my measure would always be diversity.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:03):**  I feel like that is what underpins the most effective way of understanding if a system  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:11):**  is contributing to the earth, to people, to health or not.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:17):**  I agree because it would be great to have these nutrient meters, but then what is good  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:22):**  and what is not, and what's going to be good for you and what do these numbers actually  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:26):**  mean?  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:27):**  Which is something, I mean, we don't even know how to come up with a diet that works,  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:32):**  let alone a nutrient based one.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:34):**  So that's going to be very interesting and it's going to be a lot of blah, blah, blah  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:38):**  around to hopefully get to some proxies or at least some indications of what works for  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:44):**  at least us and soil.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:46):**  And so how did, I mean, the focus has been soil, I think also already before, because  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:51):**  you were building a natural wine company, which have the name at least to be focused  
**[0:12:56-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:56):**  on soil more than a chemical based wine company.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:12:59):**  How did it lead to founding a tech company from within basically?  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:13:04):**  What was the need you saw and it got you to focus on that?  
**[0:13:08-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:13:08):**  So originally we planted 8,000 olive trees and each year we were having frost damage  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:13:17):**  issues on a few hundred trees and it really wasn't clear whether it was the same trees  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:13:24):**  year after year or maybe different ones.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:13:29):**  And then it becomes very difficult to manage because you don't know if it's just a weak  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:13:34):**  tree and you need to pull it out and change it or if it's just kind of random and some  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:13:40):**  years one gets hit worse than the other and there's nothing you can do about it.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:13:43):**  And so because of these kinds of questions, I studied physics at university, so I know  
**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:13:47):**  how to code and my dad was telling me about his, the problems with the olives.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:13:54):**  And so we came up with a system using RFID tags or contactless tags on each tree that  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:01):**  allowed us to record, we could take photos, we could record if there was a problem that  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:08):**  happened with a specific tree or if a tree had frost damage and then we could go and  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:12):**  look which trees had frost damage one year, which had them the next.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:16):**  And then we could actually start to make some decisions about how to manage those trees  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:19):**  going forward.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:20):**  You know, it's amazing how of course you can walk around the trees, but you just can't  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:26):**  remember everything obviously.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:27):**  No, and even, I mean with 8,000, which is a lot and not a lot at the same time compared  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:33):**  to some other farms, but you don't, you'll never remember because they're 8,000 like  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:38):**  eight.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:39):**  Okay.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:40):**  You can still do something, but beyond that, beyond a hundred, it just becomes too complex.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:44):**  And this was some simple between brackets, RFID tags and an app basically became a data  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:51):**  rich olive farm compared to a data poor one.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:54):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:55):**  And then you can, it just completely transforms how you make management decisions.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:14:59):**  I mean, even after the fire came through, we were then able to go through and log, okay,  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:05):**  well what state is each tree in?  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:08):**  And then we had some numbers and we could see, well, how do we move forward from here?  
**[0:15:13-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:13):**  And it was pretty clear that we needed to move some trees and replant them in a certain  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:20):**  area and then just really put our time and effort into those trees and not worry about  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:25):**  others that were more badly hit.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:28):**  So it really does help in that sense.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:31):**  And I mean, that's great.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:33):**  I think many farms, not many farms, there are a number of farmers that invented something  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:37):**  for their farm, but then to turn that into a company and actually sharing it, or in this  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:43):**  case selling it to others, to outside clients is quite a step.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:47):**  What made you do that?  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:48):**  Well, part of what made us do it is that our neighbors became interested and started asking,  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:53):**  oh, well actually for my blueberry farm, I need this.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:15:58):**  And so then, you know, I was doing all this in my spare time.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:01):**  So the demand on my time came more and more and that was why.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:06):**  But I guess fundamentally why is because for me, you know, here in Chile I get filled with  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:14):**  hope because I visit so many small to medium scale farms that are totally commercially  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:19):**  viable.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:20):**  So the blueberries we eat in the UK are exported.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:23):**  I've been to different blueberry farms here that export to the UK and they're like wonderful  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:29):**  farms.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:30):**  They have great workers and they kind of, you know, manage everything in a very ecological  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:37):**  way.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:38):**  And it just fills me with hope that actually these are the farmers feeding the world.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:43):**  Obviously blueberries is a expensive crop, but just to say that small to medium scale  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:48):**  farms exist and they are in many ways a majority.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:16:55):**  And the more that we can do to support them to be able to compete going forward and to  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:01):**  thrive going forward, I think that that's a really positive future for everyone.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:07):**  And so that was why I really decided that actually, you know, if we can really bring  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:12):**  some value here by having a technology that works, it's very simple.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:18):**  You know, anyone on the farm pretty much can use it.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:20):**  You don't have to be trained in technology and they don't need to hire a tech specialist  
**[0:17:25-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:25):**  to have it work on their farm.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:27):**  And it brings value and it saves time and it allows people to bring transparency to  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:32):**  their workers or bring transparency to what's happening in the field.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:36):**  And that, you know, most businesses today use data in some way and I don't see why we  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:42):**  should, well, obviously small to medium scale farms will benefit from small amounts of data  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:48):**  and that's really where I'm focused.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:50):**  And that sort of suggests that it wasn't there.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:53):**  So medium and small medium scale farmers obviously have a need for better data to understand  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:17:59):**  because their scale might be smaller, but doesn't mean they can remember everything.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:03):**  But you would guess or imagine from somebody from the outside like myself that there would  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:08):**  be technology solutions and that you wouldn't have to code this in your spare time basically  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:14):**  on the side.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:16):**  So, so we looked around for systems and I guess the problem was that there were, there  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:22):**  were certainly companies out there that were offering technologies, but custom build technologies.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:28):**  So that's really much more focused on, you know, companies who have a lot of capital  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:32):**  to spend on developing a technology specifically for their farm.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:37):**  Or we did find some things out there, but they were literally running on windows 95  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:41):**  and you had to have a special proprietary machine to do it.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:44):**  And an old windows phone.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:45):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:46):**  And it was just like, this is going to waste time, not save time.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:51):**  Like if you know, amazingly here in Chile, many people, I mean, they sort of have quite  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:18:57):**  amazing systems, but they, you know, they've got like poker chips to keep track of who's  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:02):**  harvesting what in terms of blueberries.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:05):**  And then it's all written down in notebooks.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:08):**  And then someone at the end of the day types it all up into a spreadsheet.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:12):**  So you can see that even the simplest of data collection tools are not in use.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:21):**  And I don't know.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:22):**  I mean, maybe those tools do exist.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:24):**  We certainly couldn't find them, but I do think the other side to it is reaching farmers  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:28):**  is difficult as well.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:29):**  Yeah, because that would be my next question is how, how has it been so far?  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:36):**  What has been the response from the market, which is you just said difficult to reach,  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:40):**  not interested, I can imagine in doing things easier, but farmers also have the name of  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:44):**  not being the most technology forward and fast movers as they have a lot to risk and  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:49):**  usually quite thin margins.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:51):**  How has been the response from your clients?  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:54):**  Yes.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:19:55):**  Well, so I mean, I obviously were operating in Chile and the UK and a little bit in Europe  
**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:03):**  and then just starting to in the U S as well.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:06):**  And each of those markets is slightly different and their response is slightly different.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:09):**  But let me talk a little bit about each one.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:12):**  So in Chile, we work with a number of different small scale farmers.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:19):**  And I would say that in Chile, people are very open here.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:24):**  The farmers are seen still as entrepreneurs and pioneers.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:28):**  You know, you can still make some good money being a farmer here.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:32):**  And so why do you say still?  
**[0:20:35-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:35):**  Well, if I just compare it to the UK market where I feel like most farms are either, you  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:45):**  know, if they're small, they're struggling to just make ends meet or they've gone to  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:49):**  a larger scale and in Chile that's different, very different here.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:54):**  Most of the farms we work with are between 10 to 30 hectares in England.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:20:59):**  That's small, but even the fact that the farm is making that much money, that's just very  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:05):**  different to the UK.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:07):**  In my experience,  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:08):**  It would be a whole, it would be a whole different podcast to unpack that probably to understand  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:12):**  if it's a sustainable thing as in they're not extracting these returns from the soil  
**[0:21:19-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:19):**  or not as we've done here, obviously.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:21):**  And now we're running on a much literally thinner, thinner layer, or is it management  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:27):**  or climate or better margins and markets or better methods?  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:31):**  There will be other costs structures.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:34):**  I mean, probably a combination of these, but it would be interesting to pack, but let's  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:38):**  go back to the response of your clients there in Chile.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:43):**  So, okay.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:44):**  So in Chile, you know, I visited a few clients since I've been here and all of them just  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:49):**  say like, this is so exciting.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:52):**  It's really helped us.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:53):**  It's really transformed how we can operate in terms of, you know, the workers are happier.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:21:59):**  They can see more what's going on each day.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:01):**  And I, it saves me loads of time, you know, sign me up and they're just excited to move  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:07):**  forward.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:08):**  So it's generally been very positive and there are actually now in the marketplace, there  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:11):**  are quite a few competitors also doing what we're doing here.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:16):**  And that's only happened, I say in the last year and a half, two years.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:19):**  Oh, wow.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:20):**  So you spurred an industry.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:23):**  Whereas in the UK, we mainly work with vineyards, but then also, uh, general farmers on soil  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:31):**  health as well.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:32):**  And to me in the UK, it's all about, uh, actually in farming in general, it's all about working  
**[0:22:39-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:39):**  with farming organizations and building trust and for people to build case studies so that  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:47):**  people start to really understand what the benefits are.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:50):**  And that's, that's been our whole approach.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:52):**  And so for example, we only just started, we only launched the soils out just over a  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:56):**  year ago now, a year and two months ago.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:22:59):**  So the case studies are just starting to build and we're just starting to see a growth in  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:06):**  people start using the soils app now.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:09):**  And can you explain a bit what the soil app is?  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:12):**  As it's different than the, the, the tree monitoring one or the sector monitoring one  
**[0:23:18-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:18):**  you mentioned.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:20):**  So the soils app, it's called sector mentor for soils.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:24):**  And it's all about enabling farmers to go out and look at their own soils and understand  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:32):**  if their soils are healthier or not.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:37):**  And so we, we worked together with the pasture fed livestock association and a soils advisors,  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:43):**  I'm sorry, a soils advisor called Niels Corfield and a soil scientist called Jenny Dungate.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:48):**  And we put together a series of protocols that are just a series of different tests,  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:23:55):**  very simple tests that you can use kind of any equipment from around the farm to do.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:00):**  So one of them is just a simple earthworm count.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:04):**  We have something called the wet aggregate stability test or the slate test, which allows  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:08):**  you to see how soil breaks down under water.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:12):**  And the key to all of the tests is that they are different ways of indicating how alive  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:19):**  your soil system is.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:21):**  So that's really what we're testing.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:22):**  And in a way you can't test that very easily in a lab test.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:25):**  You really have to go look and many soil scientists will even say that one of the best ways to  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:30):**  understand your soils is to go and look and see what's going on.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:34):**  So with our app, it enables you to easily record what you're seeing as you see them.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:41):**  And if you're counting earthworms, you can record that for each field.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:45):**  And then when you go back home, you can see, you know, the field that I tried mob grazing  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:50):**  in has my earthworm count gone up since last year or not?  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:54):**  Is my soil structure more stable or not?  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:24:58):**  And therefore from those trends, you can start to see which of your kind of experiments to  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:02):**  build soil health are working better or not.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:05):**  Which is hugely liberating because before you need it or pay a soil scientist to come  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:11):**  which then maybe told you go and look or send a lot of samples to a very, very expensive  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:16):**  lab and you don't even know.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:19):**  I mean, you know that the data that comes back, but obviously you couldn't do it for  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:22):**  all your fields, let alone multiple pieces of your field.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:26):**  And you need to do it every year or even twice a year to build up that record.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:30):**  And like with the trees, see if they suffer every year from frost damage and might be  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:34):**  time to cut or in this case might be time to change the management system.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:38):**  Exactly.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:40):**  So I think what's fundamental to all of our technology, it's about empowering farmers.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:46):**  And this tool is all about recognizing that farmers are perfectly capable of understanding  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:53):**  how soil works.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:25:55):**  They know kind of the system and the idea that someone else needs to tell them how to  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:00):**  manage their soil.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:02):**  I just think that's not, it's not very empowering and it's not really the best way to do things  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:08):**  because actually the farmers are the people who are on their land all the time looking  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:12):**  anyway.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:13):**  So they actually have some of the best insights about what's really going on.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:17):**  So by enabling farmers to go and feel confident looking at their soils for themselves, you  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:25):**  know, we have seen farmers just get so excited about that.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:30):**  One farmer, Fidelity Weston, you know, she has been farming for over 30 years and she's  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:35):**  a very ecologically minded organic farmer, pasture for life certified.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:40):**  And she had, you know, in the 30 years of farming never looked at her soil in this way,  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:45):**  she said.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:46):**  And she got so excited.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:48):**  And since then she's been doing tests, I'd say every six to eight months looking at how  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:53):**  she's experimenting with mob grazing.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:26:56):**  And so she's looking at how that is affecting certain fields that she really wanted to build  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:00):**  up the forage on as well as build biodiversity on her farm in general, because that's really  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:06):**  her driving force is to ensure that the diversity stays high while she's mob grazing.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:12):**  And is she seeing results or is it too early for that as you launched the app about a year  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:17):**  and two months ago?  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:18):**  Exactly.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:19):**  So I say that's one of the most difficult things about taking to market.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:23):**  And I would say this is generally true of farming technologies is that it takes time  
**[0:27:29-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:29):**  because in order to see results, I mean, you do start to see some very, very basic results  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:36):**  in soils if you are quite proactive about soil health.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:41):**  So like you change your grazing and maybe you put in a cover crop and do a few other  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:47):**  things.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:48):**  But you know that that change that you'll see is just maybe a few centimeters deeper  
**[0:27:53-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:27:53):**  having lots of roots and better soil structure, or you might have a slightly faster infiltration  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:01):**  rate.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:02):**  But to see like real results will take, I'd say two to three years.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:07):**  Which is in the life of a farmer, nothing.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:10):**  So exactly.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:11):**  For a tech company, that's a lifetime.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:14):**  Exactly.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:15):**  Like tech companies are made, sold or die in that time.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:20):**  So it is very, very different.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:22):**  And working with agricultural cycles in some ways is a real constraint.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:28):**  And in other ways I find it wonderful because it really draws you back to the rhythm of  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:35):**  life and where technology and life come together.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:40):**  And I think that's, yeah, to me that's a really exciting thing to explore.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:45):**  What is that point?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:47):**  What is that, you know, what's the tension there?  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:50):**  And how can we make the two work together in a way that builds ecosystems and doesn't  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:56):**  destroy them?  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:28:58):**  So yeah, I'm always playing with that tension slash symbiosis.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:04):**  And what do you see ahead if we would interview, we do this interview again in a year from  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:10):**  now, it's now March 2019.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:12):**  What do you see the next 12 months for the tech company?  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:16):**  Well, the thing I'm really excited about right now is that I was just at the Oregon Wine  
**[0:29:22-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:22):**  Symposium and I was talking about using SectorMentor for vines in order to, the same soil test.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:32):**  You can use them in a vineyard and that can tell you how resilient your soil is in your  
**[0:29:37-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:37):**  vineyard and how much you're building soil health in the vineyard.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:40):**  And what's interesting about Oregon is that it's a slightly, it's a younger wine industry  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:45):**  than California, for example, but it's certainly growing and it's exciting that they have a  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:51):**  lot of small to medium scale family vineyard operations there.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:29:56):**  And so it means that there's actually quite an appetite for innovation and also they have  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:02):**  a strong, and Oregonians traditionally always have had a strong emphasis on ecology and  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:08):**  being ecological.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:10):**  And so they are doing some amazing things there, some of the vineyards we're working  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:15):**  with there now.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:17):**  So for me in a year's time, where we'll be is that we'll have started working with these  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:25):**  vineyards in Oregon, a lady called Mimi Castile at Hopewell Wine together with her and a few  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:30):**  others will have started a kind of ecological vineyard revolution.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:36):**  And I think that that is very exciting.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:40):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:42):**  And if you look at the sector and the sector is much, much bigger, obviously the agriculture  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:47):**  and food sector, if you look at from the investing or the investor perspective, and you're looking  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:53):**  obviously as a tech company, but also as a farmer and a natural winemaker does also processing  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:30:58):**  or selling produce, what do you see as the biggest barriers to make to let this sector  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:04):**  reach a scale, obviously an appropriate scale to have a bigger impact, like to have much  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:09):**  more land being fire friendly to have stopped some of these fires?  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:13):**  What do you see as the biggest barriers for the sector to really grow and reach its potential  
**[0:31:18-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:18):**  impact?  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:19):**  From an investor's perspective, right?  
**[0:31:21-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:21):**  Or from yours.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:22):**  But if you imagine there's a there's a room full of impact investors listening, and we  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:26):**  can go into advice later, not investment advice, but what you would do if you would be an investor.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:30):**  But let's start from your your perspective as a on the land and the technology company.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:35):**  What do you see as the biggest barriers?  
**[0:31:37-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:37):**  Well, one thing that I have no answer to, and it sort of keeps me up at night is, is  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:45):**  the problem of food prices.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:49):**  And that food is so cheap, and is in a way, you know, I just don't know how to get around  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:31:58):**  that, because the truth is, is food is not cheap.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:01):**  And that there's a huge amount of risk involved in farming.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:04):**  And that there are always years where things don't work out, or a fire comes, and you just  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:09):**  can't avoid that.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:11):**  So the fact that farmers are the people who are like some of the least, or some of the  
**[0:32:18-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:18):**  people really struggling, to me that that is at the core of being or that is a big issue  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:26):**  about going forward and what sustainable or an ecological future looks like is that we  
**[0:32:30-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:30):**  need to find a way to have it be that farmers can make decisions that are for ecology and  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:40):**  profitability and that the two are aligned.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:44):**  And if you could wave your magic wand and change something overnight, would it be something  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:49):**  on food prices?  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:50):**  Yeah, I guess, if I was to change something overnight, I would just bring into place.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:32:56):**  Oh, man, I forgot the name of it right now.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:01):**  One second.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:02):**  Okay.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:03):**  True Cost Accounting System, basically, because then the no longer would food prices hide  
**[0:33:09-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:09):**  the true costs.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:11):**  And then, you know, suddenly, like food produced regeneratively would be cheaper than food  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:17):**  produced by large scale agriculture.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:22):**  That's extremely extractive, and it would just transform the system.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:26):**  And a final question, I think it's a great answer to the question, a final question.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:31):**  Let's go back to the room full of impact investors that are listening and are super excited about  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:35):**  soil and are excited about tech, but farmers first tech, obviously, what would be your  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:41):**  advice if they haven't made investments in the Regen Ag and food space, not giving investment  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:46):**  advice, but where would you urge them to start reading, to start exploring or to start putting  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:51):**  their money to work?  
**[0:33:52-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:52):**  Wow.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:53):**  Okay.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:33:54):**  I think they should listen to Farmerama.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:34:00):**  And I guess my advice, and I mean, maybe this isn't many investors appetite, but is to go  
**[0:34:09-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:34:09):**  and work on some farms and understand the reality of farming, because until you really  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:34:19):**  understand the risks involved, the difficulties day to day, why farmers make the decisions  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:34:25):**  they do, I think it's very hard to try and transform the system.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:34:31):**  For example, it's easy to say, oh, well, farmers shouldn't cut down trees because that could  
**[0:34:37-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:34:37):**  cause flooding in the next town.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:34:38):**  But if the farmer had a drought last year and didn't get any of their wheat crop that  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:34:43):**  they normally get, then they may have to cut down those trees in order to sell the timber  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:34:47):**  to have their business survive or send their kids to school.  
**[0:34:52-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:34:52):**  So I think actually working on the front line is part of the key of understanding the system.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:00):**  But obviously not everyone has an appetite to do that or the time.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:03):**  So the next best thing would be to read books like Leah Penniman's Farming While Black,  
**[0:35:12-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:12):**  brilliant book, Masanobu Fukuoka's The One Straw Revolution, Gabe Brown's Dirt to Soil.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:19):**  What else have I read recently that's brilliant?  
**[0:35:22-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:22):**  Soil by Woody Tash, also brilliant.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:25):**  I was going to say it.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:28):**  We have a signed copy.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:29):**  Excellent.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:30):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:31):**  And I guess also to go with, yeah, it is, if you can't take time to work on farms, then  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:37):**  go and talk to farmers.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:39):**  I think one of the biggest issues right now is that a lot of investors see an easy way  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:45):**  to invest in regenerative agriculture is through technology as a channel.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:50):**  I would say that's a cop out personally.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:52):**  So here I am, a technology developer saying that's a cop out, but it is.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:35:58):**  Technology is not going to save us in my view.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:01):**  And what will save us is changing mindsets and is working with people.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:09):**  And technology is a tool that will aid people.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:12):**  So to really have impact, I think what we need to look into is training, is to build  
**[0:36:21-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:21):**  case study farms that people could come visit and learn from.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:25):**  The other aspect to it is creating land trusts and building or having areas of land that  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:33):**  people can rent for reasonable prices and farm in a regenerative way.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:38):**  All those kinds of things are, there's lots of ways to get involved, but the only thing  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:43):**  I would say is, please don't just go invest in a random technology that's going to save  
**[0:36:47-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:47):**  us all.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:49):**  And I think if you are that interested in food and agriculture and in the system a few  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:36:54):**  weeks or a month or working on a farm, is that really such an investment?  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:00):**  I mean, you can read at night and you can, but to understand the difficulties, you don't  
**[0:37:06-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:06):**  need to do 10 seasons.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:07):**  Nobody's forcing you to do that, but at least have an understanding of in high season, obviously,  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:13):**  of what's happening on local farms or on a farm somewhere else.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:16):**  I think it's not too much to ask from anyone wanting to put money to work and also making  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:22):**  decisions that affect a lot of people.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:25):**  And it's very difficult to make those if you have no idea who those people actually are.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:29):**  Totally.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:30):**  Couldn't agree more.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:32):**  So I want to thank you so much for your time and I will definitely be checking in with  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:38):**  you on the company and obviously how it's going with the olive trees that got burned,  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:43):**  but hopefully some of them survive and how the Oregon wine industry is responding to  
**[0:37:48-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:48):**  the technology to really empower them instead of disempowering them.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:54):**  Yeah.

**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:37:57):**  I think, you know, this is so important to be, uh, what the work you're doing to really  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:38:02):**  connect the investment realm with the food and farming world.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:38:07):**  It seems like there's ever increasing demand.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:38:10):**  And so the more we can talk the same language and share the stories, the better off we'll  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:38:14):**  be.

**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:38:23):**  I did a, I think a year and a half ago on one farmer in our farmer community actually  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:38:28):**  in, uh, in the Netherlands.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:38:30):**  So we had some cross sharing before.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:38:32):**  Yeah, no, that was brilliant.

**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:41:29):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:41:35):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:41:37):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:41:42):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to

**[0:41:52-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:41:52):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:41:54):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:41:59-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:41:59):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:42:03):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:42:07):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:42:08-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:42:08):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:42:10):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:42:13):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/23/abby-rose/#t=0:42:17):**  It's also not investment advice.

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:00:14):**  The key role robotics are going to play in the next 20 years when it comes to scaling  
**[0:00:19-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:00:19):**  regenerative agriculture across millions of acres.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:00:22):**  It's still super early, but the first signs are very promising.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:00:25):**  So we just might be witnessing the start of a robotics revolution in agriculture, helping  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:00:31):**  farmers to grow their soils faster.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:00:36):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:00:40):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:00:45):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:00:50):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:00:56):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:00:58):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:02):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:05):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:10):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:14):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:18):**  our work, and so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:21):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former

**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:38):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:40):**  Welcome to another episode.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:41):**  Today we talk robotics.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:43):**  Greenfield Robotics was born with a simple mission to get chemicals out of your food.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:47):**  They are developing robots that enable farmers to implement carbon farming on a massive global  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:52):**  scale economically and without agrichemicals.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:55):**  Welcome Clint.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:56):**  Thanks Kun.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:57):**  Glad to be here.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:01:58):**  And to start with a personal question.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:01):**  How did you end up building soil with robots?  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:04):**  How did we start building robots?  
**[0:02:05-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:05):**  Well, about five years ago, decided I wanted to start doing what I've learned about organic  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:11):**  farming using vegetables and whatnot and wanted to do it out on broad acre fields.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:16):**  I wanted to have the biggest impact possible in getting chemicals out of food.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:20):**  Wanted to figure out how to do weed control out in large field settings.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:24):**  There's 250 million acres in the United States alone.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:28):**  How do you get rid of weeds without tilling, right?  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:31):**  Without disking, plowing, chiseling, without chemicals.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:35):**  Do what's called no-till farming.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:37):**  And there wasn't an answer out there.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:39):**  And so that's how Greenfield Robotics started with some tests without robots.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:44):**  And about three years ago, we built our first one.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:47):**  And how did you end up in farming?  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:49):**  Because not everybody is farming organic vegetables.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:51):**  Yeah, you know, it's interesting because I have a lot of friends in farming and they  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:55):**  just always knew they wanted to be farmers.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:02:57):**  And I come from a different set of circumstances.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:00):**  Like most, I grew up farming.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:01):**  I grew up here in Kansas.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:04):**  And unlike many, I hated it.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:06):**  And a lot of that was, to be honest, my dad, it was kind of his hobby.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:09):**  And so we had crappy old equipment.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:12):**  And I hated working on it.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:14):**  Just seems like things break down on the worst days for weather possible or when places are  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:18):**  closed and you're out there bailing wire and whatnot.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:22):**  So I just hated it.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:23):**  And that drove me to get into tech and really get serious about business at a pretty young  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:27):**  age.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:28):**  But, you know, things change and I won't get into the big details, but about a decade ago,  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:34):**  came back to Kansas and set out to do exactly what I'm doing, which is trying to get chemicals  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:39):**  out of food, starting with agriculture.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:41):**  And you went for the organic route focused on vegetables.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:44):**  And when did you realize you needed other solutions to basically keep the weeds out?  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:50):**  What was their specific moment or was it just a long struggle?  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:53):**  What was the turning point there?  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:54):**  You know, we had a soybean field, I believe five or six years ago, maybe five years ago,  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:03:59):**  that the pig weeds, we just couldn't keep contained.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:03):**  And they were record soybean crop for at that time.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:06):**  My dad was still alive at that point and he hired some guys to go rove and they quit like  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:10):**  a quarter way through the field.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:12):**  And so when we went out to harvest those soybeans, we literally kind of ripped up one of the  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:17):**  combines really badly trying to put a pig weeds through them.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:21):**  That was when I really said, man, this is just no good.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:23):**  And then another example would be, I took over a new piece of ground and it just happened  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:27):**  to be a spring that just nonstop rain, couldn't get out there.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:32):**  By the time I did get out there, you know, the weeds were taller than the tractor.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:36):**  And so you're like, so something different has to occur.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:40):**  And so those two things led up to it as well.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:42):**  And what is, because as a non farmer, we keep hearing the principles of regenerative practices,  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:48):**  obviously the no till or very low till or minimum soil disturbance or rotations and  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:55):**  both in time and space and the animal integration, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:04:58):**  And then you sometimes hear this almost impossible stories or they sound too good to be true.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:03):**  Like the weed pressure is no longer there, et cetera.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:05):**  You sound very different.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:08):**  What is happening there?  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:09):**  That's complete nonsense.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:10):**  There, of course, the weed pressure is still there.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:13):**  There are a lot of techniques and I tried them all before we started this and none of  
**[0:05:18-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:18):**  them, you know, let me step back for a second.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:20):**  Farming is about risk right now.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:23):**  It's all about risk, managing risk.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:25):**  I would say farmers are some of the most sophisticated risk managers in the world and given their  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:30):**  margins, they might be the most sophisticated.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:32):**  Definitely giving the Wall Street guys and girls a run for their money.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:36):**  I'm not running it off algorithms, but that's a separate discussion.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:40):**  So I think that what you realize is that none of these methods work in all situations.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:47):**  And I'll just give the example, roller crimping, which I think is fantastic.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:50):**  Just for the non farmers, what's a roller crimper?  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:53):**  Roller crimping is essentially you'll plant a cover crop, which means a crop you never  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:05:57):**  intend to harvest for grain or legumes or anything.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:00):**  And you simply plant that cover crop to restore nutrients to the soil and also maybe to slow  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:06):**  down weeds coming in.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:08):**  And so that's become a trend that's growing quickly.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:11):**  The idea that they came up with is a roller crimper basically goes in like cereal rye.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:18):**  And before you go plant your crop, you've grown this cereal rye and maybe it's three  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:21):**  foot tall or four foot tall and it's starting to mature and you go out there with this machine  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:25):**  that basically breaks it over and kills it and lays it on the soil.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:29):**  So now you have weed suppression simply by the fact of they can't find sunlight.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:35):**  And it's very effective when it works.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:37):**  The issue is, you know, we have these springs here and everyone has this at times.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:42):**  And with climate change, I think they're getting worse where we had 13 inches of rain in one  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:46):**  month.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:47):**  So everything goes through your cover crop.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:49):**  You can't get out.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:50):**  It's a really heavy deal.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:52):**  So that it just doesn't always work.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:54):**  It's a very good idea.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:55):**  And people are putting it on their planters now and same type of deal.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:06:59):**  And so it makes a lot of sense, but it is not bulletproof.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:02):**  And you're saying unless it works in all circumstances, I cannot rely on it, which means it's risky,  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:07):**  which means I'm running the risk to lose that field for the year or et cetera.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:11):**  Of course, the other option is to spray it down.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:13):**  But also there you need to get on the land plus or obviously the issues with the heavy  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:17):**  chemicals, which is exactly the reason you started to farm organically.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:22):**  So it's either cutting up the plant of the cover crop or spraying it down to die.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:27):**  And there's also some debate out there when I talk to farmers who are in more arid regions.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:30):**  I'm in a semi-arid, but if you get in more arid regions, there's a lot of farmers who  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:34):**  feel like maybe cover crops won't work for them.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:37):**  That they'll maybe take all the moisture away for the crop.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:39):**  And there's a lot of debate going back and forth on that.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:42):**  So a lot of farmers just simply are not going to cover crop at this point until they understand,  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:47):**  see enough studies that it's not going to take the moisture away from their next crop.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:50):**  And how do the robots enter the space there?  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:52):**  What took you from realizing, okay, the current set of practices and the current technologies  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:07:58):**  that are out there don't work for me on my farm.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:01):**  So I'm going to develop something else, which is already a big step.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:04):**  And how did you end up on robotics?  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:07):**  I mean, we tried all kinds of different things.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:10):**  And at the end of the day, the idea was, well, what is the primary problem right now?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:15):**  Even not thinking about trying to get chemicals out because the limitations of the chemicals  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:19):**  have become increasingly evident.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:21):**  So how do you solve this problem period, regardless of your view on chemicals?  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:25):**  And that's where I looked at.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:27):**  And so problem number one is you got to get out there before the weeds are a foot tall  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:33):**  and they become a resistant to your chemical at that point.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:37):**  And you may spout them, but a lot of times they'll come, they'll start growing again.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:40):**  You think you have it solved in two weeks later, here they come again.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:43):**  So you had to get out there.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:46):**  And so to get out there, what's important?  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:48):**  Well, can't wait a lot.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:50):**  It needs to be light.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:51):**  Otherwise your tractor will be stuck in this very wet spring.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:56):**  They weigh 140 pounds.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:57):**  They can go out there.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:08:58):**  We've been out there days after we had three inches of rain the very next day or even during  
**[0:09:02-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:02):**  the day.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:03):**  That's problem number one.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:04):**  Problem number two, how do you get rid of most of the weeds, if not all?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:08):**  Well, there's a lot of folks out there trying to do, you know, let's recognize the weeds  
**[0:09:11-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:11):**  and let's just deliver the right amount of chemical.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:14):**  My view is no chemicals.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:17):**  And so why settle?  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:19):**  And as a farmer, one thing I know is the genetics are so strong in broad acre field crops for  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:24):**  the most part now.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:25):**  When they come up, they come up very quickly and they canopy very quickly in row.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:30):**  And so that means you don't have a lot of weed pressure in that row if you did the right  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:34):**  things leading up to it.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:37):**  So the issue is not the in row.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:39):**  It's from an inch through the middle of the row, an inch to the side of that row to the  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:44):**  middle of the row is where the weeds are coming up because there's nothing to stop them.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:48):**  And so we focused on that first.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:49):**  Well, we have an in row solution.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:50):**  Yeah, we got one in development right now.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:52):**  They've worked it on for two years.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:09:54):**  So but it's, you know, 95, 98 percent of the problem.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:00):**  And it's the old technology adage of get something out there that works and you know that your  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:05):**  customer will raise their expectations of you on their own accord.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:09):**  So that's the way I view it.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:13):**  So they're so again, spraying chemicals is just not an option in my mind.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:17):**  So can you describe the robot you have out there now in terms of size, in terms of what  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:22):**  should we expect?  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:23):**  You mentioned the weight and what does it do just for folks that haven't seen it?  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:28):**  I obviously put the links to your website in the description below.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:32):**  But just for folks to imagine we're here in Audioland, what could they see when one of  
**[0:10:36-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:36):**  these robots or a swarm of robots actually moves into a field and what do they do?  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:39):**  Yeah, well, they're small and it's more of a swarm approach, meaning, you know, we'll  
**[0:10:45-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:45):**  put 10 bots out there at a time is the way we're doing it.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:48):**  And they're going to drive between the rows.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:51):**  They're four wheel drive, essentially.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:52):**  They're running off batteries between the rows of, let's say, soy, the fields you mentioned  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:56):**  before.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:10:57):**  So there's a row of soy plants that's already grown to half a meter, a meter or something.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:02):**  And then this swarm of robots basically navigates between these rows and takes care of the weeds.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:07):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:09):**  And right now we're focused on 30 inch rows.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:10):**  We do have a prototype.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:11):**  We actually was the very first spot we built that would go down 15 inch rows as well.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:16):**  But right now we're focused on 30 inch and corn, soybeans, milo, cotton, sunflowers.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:23):**  I mean, there's a lot of crops growing in 30 inch rows right now.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:25):**  And you put them at the beginning of the row and they go.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:28):**  Well, yeah, I wish it was that simple.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:31):**  Theoretically, that's the idea.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:33):**  I will say this, they're a lot more structured than your Roomba.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:36):**  So it will make more sense when you're standing there looking at them in the Roomba, which  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:39):**  I still can't figure out what the hell it's doing.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:42):**  They're basically mowing.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:43):**  And that was kind of what my test was and I thought surely it could not be this simple  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:47):**  to mow pig weeds.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:48):**  And again, we're not trying to solve all weeds.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:50):**  We're trying to solve the broadleaf, the big ones that really can ruin your crop pretty  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:55):**  quick.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:56):**  Solutions for grass weeds, herbicides still work, right?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:11:59):**  And we're working on that.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:00):**  But so we're just mowing these weeds off about an inch high repeatedly through the growing  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:06):**  season.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:07):**  The idea is we can come back in and do this multiple times.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:10):**  And we're doing it.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:11):**  I don't want to get into too many details, but the pricing model actually coincides.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:14):**  You can eliminate your chemical.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:16):**  We make it a fixed cost versus chemical is a variable cost.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:20):**  And so we operate as a service.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:23):**  And so those bots come in and go in and out of those fields as often as needed to keep  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:28):**  those pig weeds down.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:29):**  Or bear's tail would be another example.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:32):**  That's very interesting.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:33):**  Let's unpack that in a second.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:34):**  But just I want to make a comparison.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:37):**  You're basically almost grazing just the weeds repeatedly.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:42):**  Just mowing about an inch off.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:44):**  Mowing them without eating them, just repeatedly hitting them.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:47):**  I wish I could get the sheep to go down those rows, but I don't think so.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:51):**  We still need to work on that.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:53):**  And so it's repeatedly hitting that row where it's growing up and up.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:12:58):**  And at some point, the weed just gives up or you're putting it so much under pressure  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:02):**  that you keep it under a certain level.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:05):**  And so what will happen is ideally we cut right at the growing point, but that's not  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:08):**  always the case.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:10):**  And the weed basically you're backing it off.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:12):**  You're taking almost all the leaves off, if not all of them.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:15):**  And so now it's got to expend resources to try to put it back out and it just can't grow  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:18):**  back very quickly.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:20):**  So that really is what we're doing in that case.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:23):**  And that was the test I did.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:24):**  I started mowing with a rotary mower, three inches off the ground, two and a half inches.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:29):**  Go out there with a knife and cut it one inch and see what happens.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:32):**  And what the pigweed was really what I was testing the most at that point.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:36):**  So it doesn't stop them stone cold.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:39):**  It does wear them out eventually.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:41):**  They get smaller and smaller to come back slower and slower.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:44):**  So it's not perfect, but neither is any herbicide.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:48):**  That's the job.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:49):**  And so let's unpack the as a service piece.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:52):**  So I'm a farmer in Kansas.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:13:54):**  I have, let's say X amount of fields with organic soybeans or non-organic soybeans,  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:01):**  but I really don't like the chemicals anymore.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:03):**  So I knock on your door and you basically give me the wheat suppression as a surface  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:08):**  and as a fixed fee, as a fixed fee per hectare acre, whatever the standard is that we're  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:14):**  using.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:15):**  And you come in with your robots as many times as needed to make sure we keep those, the  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:20):**  pigweeds basically under control.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:21):**  Yep.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:22):**  We just have a reasonable rule of thumb.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:24):**  If they get a certain size, we're going to get out there and we're going to start working  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:27):**  with them all.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:28):**  And that is a service.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:29):**  It's a fixed fee per acre period.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:32):**  So we figure on soybeans, we're going to be out there two to five times per season.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:36):**  That is the way it works currently.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:40):**  And we don't sell the bots directly to folks right now.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:43):**  We got some great advice from another robotic company early on and they said, you know,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:48):**  technical support is a real challenge.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:51):**  And you know, so I said, all right, let's, let's go with the service model and let's  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:54):**  mask any problems we have from farmers so they don't have to worry about it.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:14:58):**  And not saying someday they might not be able to buy them, but right now if we're going  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:03):**  to sell something to folks, then it's going to be, have to be on par with what John Deere  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:07):**  or these guys had done machinery wise, which means it should be bulletproof and you know,  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:13):**  we're getting better, but it's not there.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:14):**  And looking at comparing me as a farmer to spraying, what am I looking at in terms of  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:20):**  price difference or, I mean, convenience, obviously I don't have to do anything, which  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:24):**  is much better.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:26):**  I don't have to hire somebody to spray as well because I just outsource that weed pressure  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:30):**  part to you in terms of price.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:32):**  Where are you compared to the chemical guys?  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:34):**  Obviously depending on how many times I have to spray.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:37):**  I mean chemicals for broad leaf control, we estimate are 25 to 16 acres.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:41):**  When we say we estimate, I do it and I know lots of farmers.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:44):**  And so, you know, I gathered that information.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:46):**  So we know that's true on soybeans, for example.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:49):**  Just get your feet.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:50):**  Well, what's the price on that for soybeans more or less?  
**[0:15:54-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:54):**  $25 to $60 an acre.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:55):**  I'm not actually sure.  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:57):**  I've seen anyone do it for $25.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:15:59):**  So let's say a bit higher up.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:02):**  So that's the range.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:03):**  And so I think we just lock it in at $30.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:06):**  So that's what we charge.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:07):**  It's a fixed feed $30 and it's our risk if we have a particularly rainy year and to maintain  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:14):**  that field.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:15):**  And when did you start and where are you now in a sense?  
**[0:16:17-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:17):**  How many boats are out there?  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:18):**  How many acres are you working on if you want to share that obviously, but you're further  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:22):**  than just a pilot.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:23):**  You're not only on your farm.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:24):**  Obviously, you're in the market.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:25):**  How has been the response?  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:27):**  I wouldn't say we're in market.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:28):**  We've got some beta trials we signed this year and we're actually moving out today literally  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:33):**  out on to other farmers markets.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:35):**  Now we've been on some seed company market fields in the past few weeks.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:39):**  But today, literally, we're moving on to our first sort of beta trial field.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:43):**  Otherwise we've been on mine.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:44):**  It's new technology.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:46):**  Sometimes you have delays.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:47):**  And how many acres do you have just to give a new year farm currently?  
**[0:16:50-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:50):**  Just to give an idea.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:51):**  Oh, my farm is super small.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:53):**  It's about 300 acres.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:54):**  It's a broad acre.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:55):**  And then we have greenhouses and we do vegetables and we run sheep as well.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:16:59):**  Intensive graze sheep.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:00):**  It's an art.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:02):**  And what do you see happening with this specific one?  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:05):**  And then we get to some other because you already mentioned you're working on others  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:07):**  as well.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:08):**  And so let's say we're talking a year from now.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:11):**  What would you be happy with where this specific offering of this specific robot doesn't have  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:16):**  a specific name?  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:17):**  Where would you like it to be?  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:18):**  Well, we're terrible with names.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:20):**  So we call the we're too busy to be brainstorming.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:25):**  I kind of squash those things sometimes and the engineers squash me and I was coming up  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:29):**  with too many names.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:30):**  So we bought all we're calling it right now.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:32):**  I'm sure that's not what it's going to be called when we're really marketing it out  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:35):**  and working.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:36):**  People have suggestions.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:37):**  Email you.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:39):**  Yeah, it's real super creative.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:40):**  But you know, we're getting through some trials this year.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:44):**  We're really going to hone this thing.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:45):**  I don't know that we'll be in full market next year.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:49):**  What we want to be able to show next year is how farmers look at it.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:53):**  This works.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:54):**  And so we're going to take the farms that we signed.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:55):**  We signed 10 farms and managed about 50,000 acres collectively.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:17:59):**  We'll just continue to work with them next year and show that bots bulletproof.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:03):**  We also have another bot in development that helps you with the animal grazing and intensive  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:08):**  raising, which is a key key part of regenerative ag that nobody talks about a lot because it's  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:14):**  actually very difficult to graze animals right now, especially small ruminants.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:18):**  Why is that for anybody that is wondering now?  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:21):**  Why is it difficult to farm small animal, small ruminants compared to larger ones?  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:26):**  Yeah, sheep and goats like to escape.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:29):**  It's that simple.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:30):**  And cattle are a little more chill.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:32):**  You can use a single wire electric, which doesn't take you know, it just still takes  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:36):**  time.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:37):**  I still think we have a solution for them in the making.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:39):**  But it's not as crazy dealing with sheep and goats.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:43):**  I mean, you're just my God.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:45):**  Last two years have been something else.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:47):**  So so we built a prototype for that, by the way, and it works.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:50):**  My sheep haven't escaped in a week since we rolled it out.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:53):**  OK, so basically a robotic device yet to I've heard stories, especially of goats that love  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:18:59):**  to escape and eat everything.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:02):**  And I'm imagining if you have fields and greenhouses full of vegetables and you try to keep them  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:06):**  into grass, they probably in this case, sheep love to get out and have some breakfast somewhere  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:11):**  else.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:12):**  They are something else.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:13):**  You know, they look all innocent, but I'm just telling you they're not.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:16):**  And they're smarter than people realize.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:17):**  And we did exactly have that.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:19):**  We had a lot of broccoli growing.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:21):**  As it turns out, I think that's their favorite thing in the world to grow.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:23):**  And if they ever get loose and in your broccoli, they remember that.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:27):**  And I arrived one morning at the farm as the sun was coming up because I knew I needed  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:31):**  to get a move before we had this system out there.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:34):**  And I literally watched and they had a llama with him and I saw them see me drive up and  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:39):**  across the field, look over at me, run over the fence and just make a beeline for the  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:45):**  broccoli field.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:46):**  And they must have ran, they ran across like 30 acres right to the broccoli and they're  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:49):**  munching on it.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:50):**  And then you can't, you know, once they're there, they're like, they're not going anywhere.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:53):**  It's like trying to take a candy bar from a kid, you know, it's not going to happen.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:57):**  So also there you're working on robotics.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:19:59):**  It's very interesting.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:00):**  And just dreaming a bit further or thinking a bit further, I mean, you must have opened  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:04):**  the door to so many other interesting, as robotics is getting cheaper, I think that's  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:09):**  a key underlying, like there is a reason why these things are happening now.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:14):**  Like I think the underlying technology is getting cheaper.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:17):**  The hardware working is somehow moving along a lot faster.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:21):**  We have a lot of these household robots that make a lot of these things easier as well  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:24):**  to at least sort of imagine for farmers, but also for investors, where do you see robots  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:29):**  go in like five or 10 years?  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:31):**  If you just completely dream, obviously in this case.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:34):**  Yeah, I think that if we step back for a second and most farms are around farmer as manager  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:40):**  and also doer, or they try to hire the doers, you know, folks actually do all this stuff  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:45):**  and maybe don't do as much.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:46):**  I think robotics can make the farmer a more effective manager and it may be even more  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:52):**  of a detailed level than their eye can capture at this point.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:20:55):**  I don't think you'll ever escape where the farmer has to go out and walk a field or eyeball  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:00):**  their animals.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:01):**  I've learned that from greenhouse.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:03):**  We walk our greenhouse every day.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:04):**  I don't care what technology there is, we're going to walk them.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:07):**  So I don't see them replacing, you know, that type of deal.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:11):**  But I think that we can replace a lot of the chemicals and a lot of the difficult things  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:15):**  that farmers have to do with robotics.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:18):**  It doesn't eliminate jobs.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:19):**  It just makes them more efficient.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:21):**  And I actually think it'll make farms more concentrated just using the, by concentrated,  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:25):**  I mean, you can do a lot more on an acre of ground for even a small farm like mine.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:30):**  And we hope that it'll lead to more profitability for them.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:34):**  And also it realigns consumers and farmers.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:36):**  But anyway, so go back to your question.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:38):**  I think that robotics will be woven in in 20 years.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:41):**  I'm not sure about five to 10, but 20 years to everything going in on a farm in one form  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:47):**  or another.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:48):**  And to speed that up, if you would be in charge, let's say tomorrow morning, of a $1 billion  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:54):**  investment fund and you would have to invest it, not granted, but you would have complete  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:21:58):**  freedom of how to put it to work.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:00):**  What would you do?  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:01):**  What would you focus on and what would you not focus on?  
**[0:22:04-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:04):**  I would put it all in what we're doing.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:06):**  And what would that help you?  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:07):**  Honestly, the regenerative ag right now does not scale.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:11):**  There are portions of it you kind of can scale.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:14):**  The no-till obviously people have been doing for quite a while, but to do it without chemicals  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:18):**  and the way consumers want to see it does not scale.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:20):**  And so that is exactly what we're doing.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:22):**  And that's exactly where I'd put the billion dollars.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:24):**  I would just accelerate the development of the things I already have in my mind or things  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:28):**  that are already being developed right now.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:31):**  And then I think on the other side of that is connecting consumers with those farmers  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:35):**  in efficient ways.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:38):**  Meaning I think we're going to under robotics or unleashing an era where consumers can expect  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:44):**  to know exactly how someone's raised.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:45):**  Now most aren't going to care, but the ones that do will communicate to the rest, just  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:49):**  like any other technology or way of sort of assimilation going on.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:54):**  And so if you look at what's happened in food historically, for the most part, it's a dumb  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:22:59):**  channel, meaning all the ingredients come through a dumb channel and they all treated  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:04):**  the same.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:05):**  And then some marketing guy tries to figure out how to be creative in the way to combine  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:09):**  those ingredients and slap some new improved or whatever the thing is they come up with  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:14):**  to try to sell it.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:15):**  And there's nothing wrong with that.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:16):**  That's the way it's gone on for a long time.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:18):**  When you have transparency, it becomes and you have robotics being able to enable that,  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:23):**  then it becomes about the reality of what's happening, not some little marketing moniker.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:29):**  What is the reality of what you're doing and that impact on health of humans, dogs and  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:35):**  cats and whatever, anything else we're feeding.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:37):**  How do robotics enable transparency?  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:40):**  Well, for us, one thing is you're always going to have an audit trail.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:44):**  And so when our robotics are in the field, they're always connected.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:47):**  And so one way or another, they're storing information and whether it's cameras and GPS  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:53):**  data, and it's very specific.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:23:56):**  It's not a monster tractor driving around and sort of knows where it's at and knows  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:00):**  nothing else that's going on.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:02):**  We know exactly what's going on in a field.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:04):**  And so we could literally provide consumers a log in if they wanted to see what was going  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:08):**  on in a given farm.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:09):**  I'm not saying it's going to happen like that, but that is there.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:14):**  That option is there.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:15):**  The data piece makes it completely different.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:18):**  And if you could change one thing, so we're taking away your investor hat, I'm sorry,  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:23):**  but we do give you magic powers and basically a magic wand and you have one thing you can  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:28):**  change in the food and agriculture space.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:30):**  What would that be?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:31):**  Yeah, I'd give farmers a lot more of the margin.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:33):**  That's easy.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:35):**  These guys and women and men, whatever I use guys interchangeably, whether that's right  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:38):**  or not, that's what I do.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:40):**  These folks like I'm telling you, they're salt of the earth.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:43):**  Yes, there's very sophisticated managers, but you're not in farming.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:46):**  If you don't love it, you have to be out of your mind to do what they've done.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:50):**  And they're very passionate about it.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:51):**  And they all take pride in that they're raising food and you know, any shortcuts they've had  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:24:58):**  to adopt is simply because they're getting hammered from all directions.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:03):**  And so that is for sure.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:05):**  And that frankly is something we are circling is to make sure farmers get a better deal.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:09):**  And I already do that with a pet food company named candidate.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:13):**  And so we've already proved some of that.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:16):**  Can you explain that a bit?  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:18):**  What are you doing with pet food company?  
**[0:25:20-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:20):**  Yeah, there's a pet food company called candidate pet foods.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:22):**  I've been working with this our fifth year.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:25):**  And when I originally approached their founder and CEO and about this type of deal, where  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:31):**  we would basically develop a vertical supply chain for them, that they could basically  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:36):**  monitor and know that every ingredient that went into their pet food was raised a certain  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:41):**  way and aiming towards chemical free as you would know if I'm involved.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:45):**  So that is exactly what we've been doing.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:49):**  It's been slow going at times, but actually, we've been picking up the pace and we have  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:53):**  partner farms.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:25:54):**  And what we do with these farms is we figured out that basically some of the things that  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:00):**  were occurring between the farm and their pet food plant could be changed efficiently.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:05):**  And we could take some of that margin and give it to the farmers.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:09):**  And so most of the farmers are working with us are getting plus percent over with locally.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:14):**  In return, we asked them to be no till, no broad spectrum pesticides, don't use glyphosate  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:20):**  to desiccate your crop.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:23):**  So some very basic things and over time, they're on a path to do these things that they want  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:26):**  to do anyways.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:28):**  And they would do it now if they would get the additional margin to do it.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:33):**  So I've already seen that.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:35):**  It's not like farmers are sitting around wanting to be lazy or put chemicals everywhere.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:38):**  They don't want to, they have to.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:40):**  Is it just the extra or did they already have I don't know, obviously, long term agreements  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:44):**  because something I hear in the space, a lot of farmers say I would love to change my practices,  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:49):**  but I cannot be on a commodity market.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:50):**  I need some kind of contract that lasts longer than a season.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:54):**  And then I can make changes to my cover crops, to my grazing, to my potentially robotics,  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:58):**  etc, etc, etc.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:26:59):**  Was that the case in this as well?  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:01):**  Or is it a markup basically on the suppliers or in this case, the farmers?  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:06):**  Yeah, so we basically kept prices stable.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:09):**  To be honest with you, I haven't figured out that whole model yet.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:11):**  I've done a lot of stuff.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:13):**  I've talked to economists, ag economists and gotten their thoughts on it.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:17):**  And I don't think we have that nailed yet.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:18):**  But we just know we're by and large a better deal for farmers.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:22):**  What I've said to farmers from day one that we're working with is we're going to keep  
**[0:27:25-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:25):**  it as consistent as possible.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:27):**  And for now, you're getting the additional margin.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:28):**  Maybe someday it might be less than what you could get for a year.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:32):**  But every farmer who's been around, which is most, they get that.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:36):**  They understand that inherently that those things never last.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:39):**  I mean, 2008 things went bonkers, right?  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:42):**  And farming.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:43):**  Well, where are those prices now?  
**[0:27:44-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:44):**  Where are we now?  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:45):**  Yeah, it's very interesting.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:48):**  And now to ask a bit of a tricky question, why a pet food company and not a human food  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:52):**  company?  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:53):**  It strikes me as interesting that I see cosmetics moving faster in ingredients with regenerative  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:58):**  practices.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:27:59):**  I see this case, a pet food company moving faster than a human food company.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:04):**  Is that interesting?  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:05):**  Is there a reason?  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:06):**  Would we have thoughts on that?  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:07):**  I think pet food companies are pretty darn innovative.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:10):**  And Canidae in particular, I mean, my hats off to the guy who started this.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:14):**  Now the marketing team I work with, Raffi Klatsch, who was someone I knew a long time  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:17):**  ago and we remained friends to this day, he's no longer with Canidae, but he's the one we  
**[0:28:22-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:22):**  had the discussion with and it kind of kicked off in an ad hoc way.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:25):**  And Scott Whipple, who founded Canidae, was open minded and worked with us.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:29):**  And now it's a different group there.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:31):**  They were acquired, but that thing has lived on.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:34):**  And it's a matter of, I mean, when I work with these folks, they are passionate about  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:37):**  this.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:38):**  They get very excited about various developments at Greenfield and so on and so forth.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:44):**  And I think it's just pet food is a very innovative industry right now and it just happened to  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:48):**  be right there in front of us.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:50):**  It's fascinating.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:52):**  And they were, you know, they're growing quickly, of course, but they were small enough that  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:54):**  it's a little easier to tweak your supply chain in some ways as well.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:28:58):**  Much more difficult when you're really big.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:00):**  No, of course, of course.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:01):**  I'm just fascinated about apparently the marketing department and that's the clients and the  
**[0:29:06-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:06):**  customers of a pet food company.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:09):**  I wouldn't suggest they care more about the food they give to their pets, but almost,  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:13):**  yes, in a sense that probably this pet food you get is almost better to eat than your  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:19):**  average meal you buy in an average supermarket, which is fascinating from so many different  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:24):**  society perspective.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:25):**  It is amazing.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:26):**  And, you know, I was just talking with my wife the other day and I said, you know, one  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:29):**  of the crops we've grown in Canada is chickpeas, you know, and so I was roasting some chickpeas  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:34):**  out of a can.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:35):**  I'm like, what are we doing?  
**[0:29:36-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:36):**  Like, I'm going to call the farm and have them ship me like a hundred pound bag of chickpeas  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:39):**  that I know exactly how they're raised.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:41):**  Like, this is silly.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:43):**  You know, and they're probably better than we bought in a can.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:46):**  And I've had farmers laugh about that who come out to my farm.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:49):**  They're like, my God, some dogs are eating better than we are, you know, because it is  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:53):**  the same stuff.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:54):**  Yeah, no, no, that's it.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:55):**  It's probably, I mean, in terms of clean ingredients, they have been, if you look at the packaging  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:29:59):**  and I'm not an expert, but they've been way ahead of a lot of food companies for a long  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:04):**  time and it's only logical that they're moving into the regenerative practices space, et  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:08):**  cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:09):**  But it's still, I mean, one day people write papers about this.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:12):**  What it says about society that the first movers are cosmetics, fashion and pet food  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:18):**  and not human food.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:19):**  That's it.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:20):**  But that's for another podcast.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:22):**  And, you know, I think I want to call out Canada specifically because I think they're  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:25):**  trying to be transparent and, you know, it's not their whole supply chain, obviously.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:29):**  So we're building it and they're not trying to represent that neither am I, but you got  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:34):**  to give them credit.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:35):**  I mean, this is not easy what we're doing, but the opportunity is there.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:39):**  And so just a lot of respect for the current crew and the crew that I started with there.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:43):**  And I don't know why it's pet food, to be honest with you, but sometimes it comes down.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:48):**  I think most of the things in life come down to individuals.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:50):**  Yeah, that's true.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:52):**  So a lot of credit needs to go to these folks.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:55):**  And to end with a question which you actually already answered, but maybe you have another  
**[0:30:59-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:30:59):**  take on that as well.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:00):**  I love to ask this question to John Kempf asks, slightly different in his podcast, but  
**[0:31:05-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:05):**  what do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:07):**  When he asked, John asked, what do you believe to be true about agriculture?  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:10):**  I like to focus it on region ag.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:13):**  So what do you believe to be true about region ag that others don't believe to be true?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:18):**  First off, I'm not in John Kempf's league, that guy and the things I read, it's exciting  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:23):**  and it's discouraging at the same time because I read it and I go, oh my God, I'm not even  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:27):**  close, you know.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:28):**  I'm reading his daily blog post.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:29):**  I always tell him I understand 20%, maybe 10, but I do really like it.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:37):**  But it's more about the question.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:40):**  Of course you believe a very easy answer for you is you don't believe region ag can scale  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:45):**  without robotics or without technology to get over the weeds pressure, et cetera, et  
**[0:31:49-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:49):**  cetera.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:50):**  But do you have another take on that question?  
**[0:31:52-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:52):**  If not, obviously perfectly fine.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:31:55):**  I have a ton of things on that, but I think regenerative ag is going to lead to a complete  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:00):**  reset of the way ag markets function.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:03):**  And I don't think it's just crops and fields.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:06):**  I think it's going to affect the way proteins are raised as well big time.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:11):**  And I think it's going to impact land values and it's going to have extremely far reaching  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:15):**  implications for markets that I don't see anybody has brought it up to me.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:21):**  So what do you mean land value and protein?  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:24):**  What's the...  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:25):**  Well, regenerative ag, remember you've got animals grazing.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:28):**  Which is still a discussion for many.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:30):**  I mean, I've seen the vegan farming space and there's still, it's sort of a, I don't  
**[0:32:35-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:35):**  know, it's like the fifth wheel on a car.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:37):**  Like they say, like these are the four practices you need to do.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:40):**  And oh, there's also integrated animals somehow, but it's always sort of mentioned in the after.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:46):**  It's very interesting how that is structured to sort of avoid it and not touch there.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:50):**  Or I mean, and other people are just full on, everything has to be animals involved.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:55):**  Otherwise it doesn't make sense.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:56):**  So it's a very touchy subject, rightfully so because of the KFO industry and because  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:32:59):**  of the lobby power of vegan versus big protein companies.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:03):**  But it's very interesting how it's sort of always on that side.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:07):**  But what do you mean when it comes to raising animals and land value?  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:11):**  I think a lot of people would be interested in that.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:13):**  If there's 250 million acres that come online that our animals are grazing, meaning crop  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:17):**  land annually, that's a systematic change.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:21):**  And if you're grazing them and they're moving and doing intensive grazing rotational with  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:25):**  my sheep, we use no antibiotics.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:27):**  We use no vaccines.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:29):**  They're grass fed basically.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:31):**  That's a big change.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:33):**  Being a lot more intensive than what you meant previously.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:37):**  You're stacking on top of each other and you need less land, which puts pressure on the  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:41):**  prices.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:43):**  We learned from this farm.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:44):**  There's this farm and you grow up, I must've been in a bubble, but there was a farm two  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:48):**  miles, I believe as a crow flies or three miles from where I grew up.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:51):**  I had no idea what these guys are doing.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:54):**  All these kind of intensive grazing techniques and they were doing raw milk 30 years ago.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:33:58):**  And on that, I don't know that I have a solid view.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:02):**  But these guys have been innovating doing this and they taught me kind of how to do  
**[0:34:06-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:06):**  this.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:07):**  And you can see this, this caught fire everywhere now.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:09):**  And it's just going to be a sea change, I think for regenerative ag, for food and that's  
**[0:34:14-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:14):**  protein production in general.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:16):**  And I think the other thing is when you look at robotics, small robotics like ours, you  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:22):**  have a flexibility maybe that you don't with a large machine down the road.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:26):**  Right now, we have weed bots, but there are other things you could imagine that could  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:29):**  be developed.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:31):**  And I'm not telling you we've thought through it all, we haven't.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:34):**  But you could see a lot more flexibility on what you're doing.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:37):**  So things like intercropping become more achievable.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:42):**  And I just think there's a lot of change coming.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:45):**  Now again, I am a veteran of the tech industry in 99.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:50):**  I had a cell phone from Sony Ericsson, I think it was almost a proof of concept, crazy expensive.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:34:57):**  I think one or two people in the United States had one that was ready to stream video, walking  
**[0:35:02-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:02):**  down the street.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:04):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:05):**  You couldn't imagine anybody would do that.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:07):**  But now we do.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:09):**  Screen like an iPhone.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:10):**  And you look at that.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:11):**  And I thought, man, this is what's coming.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:13):**  And I used to talk to people and be like, Oh my god, that's hard to imagine.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:16):**  Well, everyone, almost everyone's got that phone in their hands.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:19):**  Right.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:20):**  But not everyone.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:21):**  My mom just got her first smartphone.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:23):**  And so it takes a long time for these things to be adopted.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:27):**  And a lot of infrastructure has to get into place.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:30):**  So while I'm bullish on all this, you had said five to 10 years.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:33):**  That's why I say 20.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:36):**  Farmers want to adopt new technology, but you can't put your farm at risk adopting it.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:40):**  And so it's not going to be an overnight process as far as that goes.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:45):**  But in five to 10 years, I think everyone will see the writings on the wall.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:49):**  And do you see the impact of, like, let's say you're using the full suite of regenerative  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:55):**  practices, integrated grazing, etc, etc.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:35:59):**  Does that take care of some of the weed pressure in a sense?  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:02):**  Does it get easier and does less work for your robots?  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:04):**  Like, do you see those changes happening?  
**[0:36:07-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:07):**  Or is it too early or pretty much the same?  
**[0:36:09-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:09):**  Well, I think those guys have been doing a lot longer than me.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:12):**  And I would ask them, but from what little time I've been doing it on my farm, I see  
**[0:36:17-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:17):**  some changes.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:20):**  I think for it to really function, I was just having this conversation with one of our new  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:23):**  engineers the other day, to really function, it's not just grazing.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:27):**  You need to graze with different animals.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:30):**  So beef, sheep, goats, don't know beyond that, but they eat different things.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:37):**  And so that will address a lot of your weed problems if you're not letting them go to  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:41):**  seed.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:42):**  And again, if you're grazing, you consistently plant cover crops, which can be monetized  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:46):**  better if you're grazing those cover crops.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:52):**  Then yeah, you're going to cut down your weed pressure that way.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:55):**  So we'll see how it all goes.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:36:57):**  But absolutely, I mean, it's going to be a shifting landscape over the next 20 years.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:00):**  And we're well aware of that.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:02):**  Yeah, literally.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:03):**  And final question.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:04):**  I always say that it never is the final question.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:06):**  But what was the response so far from investors?  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:09):**  You've raised some money.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:10):**  And how did they understand?  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:13):**  Like regenerative farming obviously is getting a lot of press, but mostly in our bubble.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:19):**  Robotics is getting a lot of press, but not really on the farm.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:21):**  Agtech is definitely getting a lot of press, but not necessarily meaning to help build  
**[0:37:25-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:25):**  soil or to get chemicals out.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:26):**  It's mostly the precision chemical doses that you talked about before.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:30):**  How were those discussions with investors?  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:33):**  You know, I got on the internet in 97, but I listened to the stories from guys who are  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:38):**  in 92, 94.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:39):**  And I think raising money for ag robotics specifically right now is akin to trying to  
**[0:37:44-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:44):**  raise money for e-commerce in 1994.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:47):**  I think a lot of people see it and they think this is probably going to be a really big  
**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:51):**  deal, but it's so early, they're not really sure how to take it.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:37:56):**  And there are other opportunities to invest that are much more clear path, at least from,  
**[0:38:02-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:02):**  you know, what they've seen, meaning SaaS companies, right?  
**[0:38:06-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:06):**  One of our, two of our founders, Stephen and Carl, both created one of the first SaaS companies,  
**[0:38:11-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:11):**  successful ones called Crown Peak.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:12):**  That was 20 years ago.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:14):**  And now we're getting there.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:15):**  And just now we see investors in the Midwest wanting to invest in SaaS.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:19):**  They get all excited about it, but in my opinion, most of the big opportunities are gone.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:25):**  And so it's hard to resist that when you look at what we're doing, which there's more variables,  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:32):**  right?  
**[0:38:33-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:33):**  But 20 years ago, when Stephen and Carl were starting SaaS and their other founder, Jim  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:37):**  Howard, who's a good friend of mine and trying to sell SaaS solution in a major corporation  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:43):**  at that time was hard because you had to explain to them their entire financial balance sheet  
**[0:38:47-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:47):**  had to change.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:48):**  Right?  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:49):**  And so they had a lot of challenges selling SaaS.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:53):**  Now everyone SaaS everywhere.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:54):**  And I think it's the same with what we're doing.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:38:56):**  I think most people understand robotics are coming, but as an investor, they're sitting  
**[0:39:00-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:39:00):**  there going, what's my return?  
**[0:39:03-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:39:03):**  And so if you look at our roster of investors, they are a phenomenal group of people and  
**[0:39:07-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:39:07):**  they've all done very well, extremely well.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:39:11):**  And they want to see this succeed on something that isn't just about the return.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:39:18):**  But I would encourage folks that in this space in agriculture and robotics is take a long  
**[0:39:24-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:39:24):**  term view because my belief is the company we're building has more upside than anything  
**[0:39:31-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:39:31):**  I've ever seen in my life.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:39:34):**  And I've been through a lot in the last 20 plus years of technology.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:39:39):**  So while it's not overnight, we can't just go print robots out literally and go from  
**[0:39:46-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:39:46):**  10 to 10 million like you can with a SaaS or some software play.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:39:52):**  I believe that the value of this will be phenomenal over time, but we'll see.  
**[0:39:56-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:39:56):**  We'll see.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:39:57):**  Every entrepreneur is excited about what they're doing.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:00):**  I hope so.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:02):**  So I'm not in that respect.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:03):**  Everyone's bullish about what they're doing.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:04):**  So we'll see what happens.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:06):**  And imagining if there's a theater of investors, smart investors that are looking definitely  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:11):**  for deeper impact.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:12):**  I mean, they're not only interested in return, they are looking to have an impact on the  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:17):**  world.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:18):**  What would be your advice, obviously without giving investment advice, but looking at robotics  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:23):**  companies could be anywhere.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:24):**  They're looking at something in Singapore or looking something in Australia.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:26):**  If they get excited about soil and robotics, what would be a good question to ask that  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:31):**  robot company just to understand if they know their stuff?  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:36):**  You as a robotic company, what would you ask another robot company if you would be interested  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:40):**  to invest?  
**[0:40:42-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:42):**  I would want to go see the thing in action.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:44):**  I know with COVID and really understand in our case, you really need to understand the  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:49):**  context and I know COVID is a factor right now, but I think that you really need to go  
**[0:40:55-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:55):**  and see what you're getting into.  
**[0:40:57-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:57):**  Right.  
**[0:40:58-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:58):**  And spend time.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:40:59):**  And I know that the few folks that visit the farm really understood.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:03):**  I heard the words remarkable and just, you know, because you can't understand what's  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:08):**  going on.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:09):**  And I'm going to refer to our specific market, but you can't truly understand it unless you're  
**[0:41:12-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:12):**  a farmer or you've been out here and we've walked you through and you can see what's  
**[0:41:16-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:16):**  going on.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:17):**  And so I think if you're an investor, you're all about risk.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:20):**  You need to understand it depth, the opportunity.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:23):**  And I can tell you about it all at once, but seeing is believing.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:27):**  And I think with robotics, the physical nature of it, you have to understand that too.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:32):**  So that it's not really a question.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:34):**  It's my answer is this is what I think you should be doing.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:37):**  I think it's a perfect answer.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:39):**  And it's actually an answer we hear all the time about go and visit arms.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:46):**  In this case, go and visit farms where the robotics are are swarming around.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:50):**  But go and see it, go and touch, go and listen and go and learn because you cannot do it  
**[0:41:55-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:55):**  through audio in this case or through Zoom or through.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:41:58):**  I mean, there are a lot of clever ways, obviously, to visit the farm now digitally.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:42:02):**  But it's not the same.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:42:03):**  You need to understand, you need to feel, you need to smell, you need to touch, you  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:42:06):**  need to to really, really listen.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:42:08):**  So I think it's a perfect way to end the podcast.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:42:10):**  I want to thank you so much for your time, Clint.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:42:13):**  And I'm pretty sure we're checking in to see how the 10 robots became 20 and then 40 and  
**[0:42:18-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:42:18):**  then 100 and how the other ones are coming out.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:42:21):**  And if we have any good names, we'll email you.

**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:42:32):**  No, don't do that.

**[0:44:57-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:44:57):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:01):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:45:06-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:06):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:09):**  Thank you.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:10):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:45:11-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:11):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:45:18-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:18):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:20):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:25):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:30):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:45:35-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:35):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:36):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:45:41-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:41):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:45):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:50):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:45:51-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:51):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:53):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:55):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:45:59):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:46:01):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/15/clint-brauer/#t=0:46:06):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

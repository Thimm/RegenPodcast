### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2022-00-11)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  What would a world look like when you paid a true price for a product?  So including all the environmental and the social costs.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:20):**  It's crazy that all these externalities are not part of our accounting and thus pricing  system.  We have often talked about true cost accounting and true pricing on the podcast, but never  really unpacked how to get there.  There are so many experiments happening at the moment and so much research, and I'm very  
**[0:00:34-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:00:34):**  happy to unpack them with one of the true pioneers in this space.  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  planet mattered podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:01:00):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:01:18):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

Welcome to another episode today with Pietro Galgani of the impact Institute, a spinoff  of the true price foundation.  Their mission is to empower organizations and individuals to realize the impact economy.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:01:54):**  A growing number of farmers, producers, shops, wholesalers, cafes, restaurants, and supermarkets  work on true pricing.  A true price is the market price plus the social and environmental costs of the product.  Welcome Pietro.  Thank you.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:08):**  And to start with a personal question, what brought you to work, I mean, on an accountancy  level and a calculation level, the cost obviously, but so deep into the food system and indirectly  also on soil?  Yeah, I think already from high school, it's more for me the question where you just get  the drive to work toward a sustainable future.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:31):**  And then I think started already back in high school when there was a bit of a global movement  for a rights of people and equitable development.  As a student, I was involved in that.  And then later in university, I was studying industrial ecology and international development.  Wow.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:02:50):**  And I came really to the awareness that in the end the food system, land is the basis,  but also that the current agriculture system is very huge problem.  It was also a sort of the awareness rose in that period, like 15 years ago of big problems  of big agri.  And there I started to really see that as a key for more sustainable and equitable development.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:21):**  Then I actually did my thesis about composting as a master student.  So that's where the love for organic matter started.  That's fascinating.  And then how did you end up at the Impact Institute or at your price maybe before that?  Because Impact Institute is relatively young and I think you've been there for a bit, but  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:03:41):**  how did, because you could also have ended up at a compost company or let's say more  the agriculture side of things.  Well, yeah, I always like to keep the holistic picture when analyzing this global problem.  We got trained in university also about systems thinking and not focusing on a problem too  narrowly to avoid a backfires, that the solution backfires.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:03):**  And then when I saw this organization, True Prize, I was really fascinated by the idea  of putting down social and environmental impacts together in one coherent framework that also  simplifies it and can create so many possibilities.  So that's why I joined.  And also I was really fascinated by the fact that it really interfaces with business as  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:31):**  well as NGOs and people.  It's a really powerful idea of the True Prize.  So let's unpack it.  If you have to tell your grandmother or your children, very young children, what is a True  Prize?  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:42):**  Like in the simplest terms, people that haven't gone deep into the heart of the economic beast,  how would you describe that to someone that's interested but doesn't know too much about  it?  Oh my God.  I don't know if I can explain it to my grandmother.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:04:56):**  I think when I explained it to my in-laws, mother-in-law in the end, I only understood  it when there was a TV show about it.  I hope the average listener is not like my grandmother or my children.  Actually we had quite a few people bringing up, we need some kind of true cost or true  prize accounting.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:14):**  We need the real prize of things because too much has not been calculated in that.  And I think it's very easy to say that, but then do it obviously is a whole different  realm.  So that's what we're going to unpack, but for anybody that hasn't thought about that,  what is the simplest explanation of a true prize?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:29):**  We say that the true prize is the price of a product.  If you would also include social costs and environmental costs that this product cost  when being produced and used.  So a cup of coffee in a bar or something like that, instead of, I mean in Italy costing  one Euro and in the Netherlands maybe four or five would cost four or five plus the environmental  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:05:52):**  plus the social costs.  Yeah.  So when you, to make a cup of coffee, you will have greenhouse gas emissions.  You will have land use, water use.  You can have air pollution, water pollution, but also you can see how the labour conditions  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:08):**  along the value chain can be suboptimal.  That's a very diplomatic way of saying that.  Well there is a, you know, people earning below a living income everywhere in the economy.  There is labour rights, which are legal.  They're not always being met.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:25):**  So all these costs together are costs that are basically present.  They're usually paid by someone or they will be paid by future generations.  And the idea is to bring them all down to the level of one product, one cup of coffee  and show it as a surplus cost, surplus price.  And the insight is also that the science to calculate this impacts at product level has  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:06:52):**  been growing a lot in the past decades.  And now it's the last step is really just to bring it together and see what does it  mean in terms of costs.  So you're saying that the data probably is there for many products, probably not all,  probably not at the exact level of that type of coffee or that specific brand, et cetera.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:12):**  But we can state with quite considerable certainty, certain things about bananas, certain things  about et cetera, et cetera.  And now the challenge is to get it out of those papers and out of those research studies  into a price like next to the product.  So you can actually have an idea if the coffee is way too cheap or if the difference is relatively  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:31):**  small.  Yeah.  So there is a field of true cost accounting, which is really about how do you measure these  things and it can be for product as much as for a farm or for a region or for a country.  And when we say true pricing or true price, it really means, okay, but what does it mean  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:07:49):**  when a product is in a shop?  What are the negative impacts that you can attribute to that product and what's the cost  of that?  The price is of course a very recognizable number, maybe the most recognizable number  that everybody uses all the time.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:05):**  And it's a fascinating idea that we're the same ease with which we choose the cheapest  product or we look at prices of product.  We could also know what is the sustainability profile or the human rights profile of a product.  And I think that's where we need to go as an economy.  And how, let's take a product, maybe bananas, but you should correct me if there's an easy  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:32):**  one or one we know more about.  Like how much would you say of the environmental cost do we know or are we able to, are we  close to 90 or a hundred percent that we can say with quite certainty, okay, we know that  the costs are somewhere in the range of this and then the same for the social cost because  I'm imagining that might be more difficult or am I wrong there that there's more data  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:08:52):**  on the environmental side and less on the social side or are they sort of equally developed  over the last decade?  Yeah, it's a difficult question because of course you cannot know the percent that you  are at if you don't know the total, but in terms of like, it also depends on which, how  you look at it.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:08):**  What do you want to include?  Yeah, in the way that we look at it, we have developed a list of impacts of like 10 social  impacts, 10 environmental impacts that you should measure.  We also have a backup list of 10 impacts, societal impacts that right now there's no  data, but you should also take into account.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:26):**  Let's put that aside for a moment.  Okay.  And this whole framework is online, right?  You have it on the website.  I will link that below.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:33):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So on trueprice.org you can find it, the principles for true pricing.  And for each of them, we have developed a sort of unit price.  So for one unit of CO2, one cubic meter of scarce water and different units for pollution  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:09:51):**  and for labor indicators.  And then the question is, yeah, how do you know for each product how high these indicators  are?  And I think there is a methodology for all of them and we've been delving deeper in some  products like banana, coffee, cacao, chocolate, but it can be also very intensive research.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:15):**  Right now you can cover maybe 50% of this list relatively quickly.  And then on the social side as well, like there's enough data to put certain prices  on things?  Yeah, the data on the social side is being collected by NGOs a lot on a specific theme,  in a specific region, in a specific value chain.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:35):**  And we do a lot of piecing together different research done by other organizations.  It seems that there's a lot of research, of course, not everywhere, but it's just about,  it's never been used in this way.  It's never been used to look at the social cost of one t-shirt.  And that's our work.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:10:49):**  A lot of this is converting this research to true prices.  But we also work with questionnaires on farm.  We worked in banana, coffee, mangoes, lime, all sorts of commodities, especially agricultural  commodities to really collect data on farm level.  Because you can start with an estimate, but you want to end up with, especially for the  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:17):**  most important impact of a product, you want to have good measurement that really reflects  that specific production region, that specific production area of farm.  And I think the exciting piece, but also there, and maybe it's been happening before, but  what I've seen over the last, let's say a year and a half following you guys, obviously  girls on LinkedIn and other places is that these prices actually have gone out into the  
**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:40):**  wild.  So people, shops, farmers, organizations, actually some supermarkets even have been  starting to use these prices.  And so how should I envision that?  Like I walk into a cafe, you mentioned a cafe.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:11:52):**  I think an easy place to start, talk about coffee, chocolate, and those kinds of things.  What does it look like?  Is there an extra price on the bill?  Like how does it present itself to me as a regular customer that maybe is interested,  but not absolutely knowledgeable about this work?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:06):**  Yeah, the most common way is just, you just see, when you pay on the receipt, there is  an entry next to your coffee, which is the environmental cost of your coffee or a social  cost of your coffee.  It's being used now by being launched in a cafe in the Netherlands, actually November.  And since November, the year before, because we always do these launches on Black Friday,  
**[0:12:33-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:33):**  it's in a supermarket in the city center that is selling fruits, vegetables with this concept.  And yeah, actually it's a bit up to the retailer, to the shop, whether they want to make it  optional to pay it.  They want to make it mandatory or they want to make it just show it.  Just transparent.  
**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:12:56):**  Yeah.  Those are sort of the three levels, right?  Like one is transparency, two is if there's an option to pay.  And what does it mean for, I mean, I don't know if you know the prices out of here, but  like a kilo of banana.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:07):**  So I'm in this supermarket in the city center of Amsterdam.  Does it more than double the price?  Does it just adds a bit?  What is the experience there?  And then of course the question, I mean, they are still in business.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:15):**  They did survive.  Like how many people are actually paying the full price, the true price?  In the supermarket is called the Anzert.  It's just mandatory.  Everybody's paying it.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:26):**  Okay.  So he or she decided to make it like there's, if you enter the supermarket, you pay the  true price.  No discussion.  Yeah.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:33):**  We're just starting to scratch the surface now of what it means for the average consumer  to see this and to hear about this.  So we said, let's start simple.  You have to pay it.  And if you want, you can learn more about it, but you don't have to make this choice  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:13:47):**  as a consumer in the shop.  And well, they didn't say any sale going down.  And I think they had a hundred thousand transactions in the first years using the true price.  So of course the idea is also becomes a leverage point to finance a sustainable transition  in the agri-food sector.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:09):**  Yeah.  Because then what happens with the extra money?  What's the let's first up, do you know at all how big the difference was with the original,  let's say extractive price and the true price?  Yeah.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:23):**  To give an idea, I think usually on a kilo price of fruits and vegetables, it will be  below one Euro.  The difference extra.  Yeah.  So very little.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:33):**  Yeah.  It's quite little because when you calculate how much it gets produced on a farm and then  you're in the end, it ends up often being very little.  And then what happens to, let's say that extra Euro.  Yeah.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:14:45):**  What happens to the premium?  Yeah.  So this will be the next step that we're working on now in our journey is to create the infrastructure  to bring these funds back to make the economy actually better or make the people that go  affected better off.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:04):**  Our first part was really to make this possible to calculate it and to make it visible to  everyone.  Right now it's partly invested in carbon offsetting through, we work with a partner or we work  with a foundation that does its reforestation projects.  Which one are you working with?  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:26):**  Just for the, because you've done some research there for sure.  Yeah.  With Land Life Companies called.  Okay.  We interviewed Yuriy and I think he was number two five years ago when we started the podcast.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:36):**  All right.  Nice.  Exactly.  So we don't have right now the way to bring it back to the farms.  We donate part of it to give directly for the areas that work in the same regions where  
**[0:15:52-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:15:52):**  some of the products are made.  Very interesting.  Yeah.  So it's one of these charities that really focuses on bringing just sort of basic income  or just bringing money back to the people and let people decide what's the best way  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:09):**  to invest it.  For anybody that didn't hear about GiveDirectly yet, or a lot of the work of the effective  altruism movement, go and look into it.  It's fascinating.  It will challenge you about philanthropy probably quite a bit.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:20):**  It's basically wiring money into the pockets of the poorest of the poorest in mostly East  Africa, but they're definitely expanded and they are fully free to spend it the way they  want as they are the people that know the best how to get out of poverty.  And they've been very, very successful and very rigorous in terms of measurement.  So definitely recommended to look into GiveDirectly.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:40):**  I think it's.org, but if you search for it, you'll find it.  But now after one year working with a supermarket, we're also working with two farmers that supply  a lot of the fruits and vegetables there and discussing with them, okay, can we spend this  funds?  It becomes a bit like fair trade, almost like it goes into a pot that they can manage.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:16:58):**  I mean, of course you want to avoid certain things of fair trade, but you want to empower  the people that pay the cost also locally, literally, because they pay the cost of the  chemicals, they pay the cost of air pollution, low wages, et cetera.  Somehow you have to get it into their pockets would be ideal.  Yeah, it's funny that you mentioned fair trade.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:15):**  We also work with a fair trade flower farm in East Africa with some flower shops in Amsterdam.  We also collected extra premium that could be put in the workers fund.  But actually we have a vision that goes beyond that.  And the vision is that this extra cost, which we call the true price gap, is the gap from  the normal price to the true price should be used for remediation.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:17:40):**  So when your product is in the shop, it has already been produced, all the impacts it  has created should also be paid off when you buy the product.  And we don't necessarily say the consumer should pay this price, but we say it's linked  with the transaction of buying this product.  It could also be, of course, that this cost is spread along different steps of the value  
**[0:18:05-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:05):**  chain, whatever the profit lies.  Anyway, who benefits should pay the cost?  And then the idea is that some types of impacts you can compensate people, some type of impacts  you could reverse them or restore them in the environment.  We also calculate some impacts as a sort of, we call it retribution cost, is almost like  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:28):**  a injustice cost, which we estimate looking at fines in different countries.  How does that work?  What do you mean by fines?  So what is the...  Yeah, legal fines.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:18:41):**  For example, when we look at labor rights violations, human rights violations, you can  talk about restoration costs, which would be, for example, in the case of child labor,  you could look at the cost for getting children out of child labor, program costs.  You could look at compensation costs, like costs to compensate people for the damage  that they have received.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:13):**  And we say, yeah, you should definitely do both of these, but it's also not enough.  It's not enough because it's not just, okay, now you're compensated, it's all good.  We say, no, there is something more on top of that.  And we can continue doing the same.  No.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:28):**  Yeah.  So there's a component that is illegal actually to have child labor, right?  It's not allowed.  It still happens in some places, especially in the Northern part of the world or in more  developed industrialized places where people are able to afford more.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:19:44):**  They should also be able to afford to check that there is no child labor.  So there is a big responsibility there.  And then we also look at the costs of child labor fines in different countries to sort  of derive an additional retribution cost.  And then we have principles for true pricing.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:04):**  We sort of set out our vision of how you can, on one side, calculate this cost for different  types of impacts.  And on the other side, it also provides a blueprint of if this would be a reality in  the shop, how would you use the money?  And that's what we're working towards now to really make this market on the other side  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:28):**  as well.  And have you seen a big, let's say shift in attention in the last, let's say two years,  Corona years or crazy crisis year, food security, empty shelves, et cetera.  What has happened?  Is there more attention?  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:20:42):**  Is there finally, I see a lot of interest in, let's say the food sector.  Have you seen the same through your work in, in true cost accounting and true pricing?  I think so.  I think there is definitely here in the Netherlands, a lot of talking about it.  The word true price made its way into the ministry of agriculture policies or plans  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:04):**  and also into the program of some political parties, quite a few.  So that's definitely something that you couldn't say five years ago.  I think also in the sustainable agriculture space, regenerative agriculture as well, you  hear it more and more.  I think it is a bit, it's very powerful concept because it's a bit intuitive.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:25):**  The fact that there is a price and we're not paying it.  Yeah, we're not paying it.  And at the same time, it also puts a bit, everyone is able to communicate about this  problem because the price is such a unit and the cost is such a universal concept.  And then we can, we can start talking about this problem in a common language.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:21:47):**  So from the farmer to the retailer, to the consumer, to the policymaker is some kind  of something that is to grasp.  With a goal, I'm imagining that at some point the gap becomes smaller.  Absolutely.  Yes.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:01):**  In a sense that, that this money is used or other money is used and investments are used  and said that the agriculture principles, the agriculture practices, and of course the  social practices on the farms, in the value chain, in the slaughterhouses, in the whole  chain, which is definitely a slavery term, all the way up to your plate is paid properly.  And does the gap at some point disappears?  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:23):**  Is that the long-term vision?  Absolutely.  Yes.  So the goal is a, yeah, a sustainable and inclusive economy.  And this is just an intermediate step to get there.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:34):**  But in the end, so in economic terms, of course you're talking about externalities.  So there is some costs which are not paid by the value chain, but they are created.  External costs therefore.  And this is the idea that they should be internalized.  They should become production costs.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:22:54):**  Every time you pollute, you cannot pollute the water.  You have to put more filters, you have to change your technology and that that way you  internalize this costs.  And then the product is sustainable.  The production becomes sustainable.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:07):**  And these calculations become part of the suppliers, the companies that buy it, the  retailers, et cetera.  How about the accessibility?  Because I can imagine people already think, yeah, but it means that stuff gets more expensive.  I mean, it means that we all share the price for something we anyway end up paying or our  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:23):**  future generations.  But what do you say when I don't know, you're in-laws or somebody says, yeah, but that means  things get more expensive in the supermarket.  What about people that cannot afford that?  Yeah.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:32):**  So of course it can be actually implemented in different ways.  So the way that we do it is we put in the shop as an option.  This is our way of doing it.  So pay if you can.  And then you somehow need to calculate, of course, how many people do that, which has  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:23:45):**  to compensate for the people that don't.  But it's also, that's a potentially fairer way of doing it.  Yeah.  You could also on a bigger scale, when you talk about just true pricing, so higher costs  for products that are more polluting, products that have a worse history, how they're made.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:04):**  You can also think about using the money differently.  If a government does it, the possibilities are also other possibilities.  You can use it to clean up the act, but you can also use it to subsidize more sustainable  alternatives.  For example, for the case of food, we did this work for the United National Food System  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:22):**  Summit study about the global true cost of food.  And the biggest part is the health costs.  So we look at environmental costs and we look at health costs of consumption.  And that was bigger than the environmental costs, according to the way that we looked  at it.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:41):**  I actually have the numbers here.  It's a fascinating research.  I will put it in the links below, but just the externalities, I'm using that word again.  I'm reading here.  So the total global food, it's going to be a lot of zeros, guys, so be ready.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:24:53):**  The current total global food consumption is about 9 trillion.  That's I think 12 zeros.  These externalities that occur from this food system are 7 trillion in environmental costs.  So the 7, 9 is what we pay all together for our food every year.  So it's 7 in environmental costs.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:11):**  It's 11, what you mentioned in human life, that's the health cost.  So it's more, so we pay more for the human costs of the food system than actually we  pay for food.  And then there's another 1 trillion in economic costs as well.  So together, I think the summary is quite interestingly that food should be three times  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:25):**  as expensive.  So it's globally on average, obviously taking in huge differences to pay for all the costs  that occur, which is massive.  It's like the health part is very, very like out of sync with the rest if you look at it.  Yeah.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:40):**  And this is the, of course, not the food should be three times expensive.  This is the current food system.  If you would pay true price, but we hope that we can have a more stable food system, which  doesn't triple the price.  What was the biggest, do you remember from the report or I would just link it below as  
**[0:25:57-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:25:57):**  well with that health piece, was there like the 11 trillion, is that the obesity epidemic  or what there must be a big chunk of that in the, are we eating the wrong things, too  much salt, sugar, et cetera, or is it very spread out?  Like all the things we get from eating, eating the wrong kind of food.  It was mainly cardiovascular diseases.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:17):**  Wow.  Okay.  So then I think that's a massive killer.  I'd love to look it up, but yeah, sugar, salt, that would be the fat, that would be the biggest  causes.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:28):**  That's very interesting.  And that's of course depends on where you are, et cetera, but a rough estimate, like  we all pay the price now or in the future, which is a multiple of what we currently pay  for our food.  And thus either we continue doing that or we start paying the price or we start cleaning  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:43):**  up the food system.  That's sort of the two options we have.  Yeah.  I think similar studies, like there was one published by the Rockefeller Foundation about  the true cost of food in the United States, which I think...  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:26:55):**  Based on your research or based on your framework.  Yeah.  They used a part of our monetization factors and they found similar things so that external  costs would be way higher than the actual value of the food.  But I think, yeah, so you asked how are we going to be able to afford this as consumers  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:14):**  when we are in the shop?  And on one side it is, yeah, so you could think about implementing in a way that makes  the healthy choice, a sustainable choice cheaper, and that would already shift the economy after  a bit.  You have to bring in those health costs basically somewhere because somewhere we're paying for  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:33):**  those health costs.  Like the health system became so incredibly expensive over the last, especially in the  global North, obviously that those costs should come to fixing the food system.  Yeah.  That's the component.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:27:45):**  And the healthcare cost part of it is just the value of health for people, the wellbeing  loss.  It's not only about how much it costs to cure.  It's better to be healthy than to fix you to become healthy.  Yeah.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:01):**  And another point is that if you would optimize the economy in this way, the gap would be  smaller.  I mean, the rising price, we think it's going to be smaller when you actually prevent things  rather than looking at all the damage that you create and cultivating that, which is  what we're doing right now.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:19):**  And the third thing is also that, well, it might become more expensive, but for me personally,  it's also just the mirror of the fact where we are, right?  The world is full and we need to think about how to deal with that.  We realize that the environment is going to be under pressure everywhere, but also people  are under pressure everywhere and we have to adapt.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:28:44):**  We have to go through a transition that we don't know exactly where it goes, but it could  mean less consumption.  And so what would you say, let's say there's a stadium, let's say a theater full of investors  listening to this and we're on stage and we're having this conversation live, which at some  point we hope to do.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:03):**  What would you tell them with all this data, all this research, all these pricing, all  these numbers, what would you tell them?  Not giving investment advice, but where to start looking to deploy their capital or to  invest?  What are interesting places you think that's where, let's say investment capital could  
**[0:29:22-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:22):**  shoot start digging a bit deeper and start doing things.  Is that on the health side?  Is that on the measurement side?  Is that where would you see a role for investment capital in this transition?  I find it difficult.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:29:35):**  I'm studying a lot of problems that the market has not been able to solve.  And then I have to think maybe I'm not qualified to give investment advice, but I think the  natural capital, of course, it's being right now not as valuable as other types of investment.  But I think in the future, if you want to invest long-term, that's where the value will  come from.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:05):**  It's much more safe.  And also it's interesting the fact that these true price gaps are very small for each product  sometimes.  I mean, when we look at the global cost, it comes out very big.  It's massive, but on fruit it's a euro.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:23):**  And what does it have a coffee, for instance, do you know, or chocolate?  I think also, yeah, you have to think just a matter of cents or a half a euro.  Well, they are very destructive.  It's not a light product for the earth, let's say chocolate and coffee.  And even there, if it's only cents or maybe 50 cents or less in a euro, it shows the potential.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:40):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they're huge markets.  But we also didn't look at the health costs of coffee in a normal true price calculation  that we do.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:30:51):**  And part of it, I will talk about it later, but the framework that we developed, we call  it the rights-based approach to true pricing.  And part of it of the health cost is also, yeah, to what extent is it a consumer's choice  to buy unhealthy food?  To what extent is actually the responsibility of the producer?  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:12):**  And of course you can have two or three podcast episodes about this dilemma.  Just about that.  But right now we focus a lot on with our work also on environmental costs and labor rights,  because that's very straightforward actually that we need to do something about it.  And it's everyone's responsibility.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:31:33):**  But the fact that these margins are quite small, when you bring it down to the product  level, I think it has an interesting possibility for when making it possible for consumers  to cover it without having to have the whole intermediary value chain step.  So if you go and buy a cup of coffee, it will be possible maybe to know where it comes from  and then to also be able to pay those 10 cents extra to someone who made their coffee beans  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:05):**  and for whom it makes a big difference.  With technology, we can probably get that money straight into their pockets.  Yeah.  And I also think that really the people really want to make a difference and this really  gives them a tool.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:19):**  Do you see that the consumer is, I mean, the 100,000 transactions in that supermarket since  last year, Black Friday is a proof of that.  But do you see that as well?  Like the consumer, maybe not the average, but a good chunk of consumers is ready for  this and is eager and hungry for these kinds of tools to give them more to do than only  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:38):**  to buy organic or to buy certain things?  Well, if you think about consumers, you question, but if you look at them as people or as people,  oftentimes we don't want to know how something is produced because we enjoy it so much.  And then we learned about how it's being produced and it creates some environmental problems.  It's social issues.  
**[0:32:58-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:32:58):**  For sure.  And then we say, oh, I don't want to buy anymore or I don't want to forget.  But if you would say, well, you can just pay a few cents extra to help in this, to help  the transition to getting rid of this.  I think a lot of people don't have these tools now to do something about it.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:18):**  And they don't have the research.  So I believe that people want to make a positive difference, but right now it's impossible.  It seems like everywhere you turn, you're creating climate change.  Which is true, probably.  You just stop breathing.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:33):**  And so let's unpack that rights-based approach a bit.  You mentioned the labour right.  I mean, nobody can argue with that or should be able to argue with that, but you're taking  it beyond that as well.  What is the rights-based approach?  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:33:45):**  So I think it's not a scientific exercise to measure the true price.  It has some normative choices that you have to make.  Like what exactly are you going to take into account and what not?  And how are you going to put a price on certain things?  So neuroscientists can answer that.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:06):**  And maybe economists can answer that.  But do you want only economists to answer that?  So we think the idea is that, well, if you have some normative choices to do, what's  the highest normative framework that we have, the reference that we share with all the people  in the world.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:25):**  And that is the human rights, the international law.  That when it was done, like less than a hundred years ago, the declaration of human rights,  it was really milestone in the history of humanity.  And now, of course, we were, Rolow was born after that.  And it sounds like, oh, it's always been there.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:34:44):**  But it's not.  It's an intentional statement by all the governments of the world to do certain things like eradicate,  give everywhere a decent standard of living, the opportunity to have good health, the freedom  from many types of suffering.  And we try to make an economic framework which is within that.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:35:05):**  So we say, how would we actually use it?  We include only elements.  So these impacts that you actually sum on top of the true price, we only include those  that we can clearly link to some United Nation goal, United Nation declaration and other  things.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:35:26):**  That's why I was saying consumer health, it can be quite a bit of a discussion because  it's the question whether it's an infringement of someone's right or not.  And another way that we use human rights framework is this idea of remediation costs.  So I think 20, 30 years ago, the human rights discussion or policymaking started to move  towards business as well.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:00):**  So businesses also have responsibility for what happens in their value chains regarding  human rights.  They share the responsibility of government.  And this is what now is really turning into some law in the European Union.  I don't know outside, but they're starting to pass laws that say a company is responsible  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:22):**  for their suppliers, human rights infringement.  And the duty of business in this document called the United Nation guiding principles  for business and human rights, which is actually one of the sources of the whole corporate  responsibility movement.  The duty of business in this document is to remediate harm made.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:36:47):**  So we say, okay, let's just take that as a way to calculate the price.  What would it cost to remediate?  So yeah, I think the rights based approach to pricing is saying, let's make an economic  system which actually wants to respect the rights of people.  So of course you want to prevent infringement first, but whenever we can see, because there's  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:16):**  data showing that there is infringement, then we must be able to remediate it and let's  put that in the price.  And we also think that sustainability is a matter of human rights.  I think the United Nation is mildly stating this, but it's a bit too separate sides, sustainable  development and human rights.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:39):**  And we say, let's make this link.  I mean, we're talking about the rights of future generations and sustainability.  It's also a matter of their rights.  So we can actually develop a framework which covers both environmental and social implications  of a product, which is based on rights.  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:37:57):**  So what are the next steps?  I mean, you mentioned the three steps, first transparency, then it's an option to pay this  price and then it's mandatory.  Of course, there are many ways that could happen.  Could be that the shop, like we discussed, put that in or the government, or what do  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:10):**  you see now as big milestones?  Like what are the next big milestones for you guys basically in this transition?  I mean, the Black Friday launch is always interesting, but what are you looking forward  to or what are big ones?  Yeah, we want to see transparency.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:23):**  So businesses that are actually succeeding more in the market by being transparent, being  rewarded by consumers.  And that's why we also want to see something that reaches the people.  Not only it's something for the sustainability report or the sustainability department or  the academics.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:38:44):**  So we want to see governments starting to, or actually we see also in the Netherlands  a bit, there's value chain actors.  So market players are actually companies are actually starting to discuss this with the  government.  It's a great sort of a level playing field, which would be interesting for them.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:02):**  Yeah, exactly.  Because sometimes to make a value chain more sustainable.  So I'm not talking now about regenerative agriculture starting a brand new system, but  also for farmers to convert, it's a big price tag because a lot of the reward on environmental  costs is not yet paying off.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:20):**  But what if it would be?  And very different question.  If you'd be in charge of quite a large investment fund, let's say a billion dollars or billion  euros in Europe, obviously you're not an investor.  Don't give investment advice.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:34):**  And we mentioned before, but what if you tomorrow morning had a new job and you'd be in charge  of this investment fund, what would you focus on?  Like let's say the length could be very, very long, but it's definitely an investment fund,  not a grant fund.  What would be the main sectors or the main approaches?  
**[0:39:48-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:39:48):**  Would it be a lot of compost facilities?  What would you focus on with your investment fund if you'd be in charge tomorrow morning?  I don't know.  I find it very difficult.  I've been thinking about this question since I listened to your podcast once the first  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:02):**  time, but I really don't know.  I see all these problems that markets cannot solve and I'm more thinking like, you know,  we need different policy.  What grant funding could do that?  Lobby could do.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:14):**  We need different policy.  We need more commons.  We need more donations of land, of knowledge.  We need different education system.  We have a lot of technology already.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:30):**  I think, yeah, if I would say something, I would probably say, I would like to see the  two prices in all the big retail retailers from electronics to t-shirts to food.  Is there any sector, I mean, would you start with food or would you start with electronics  or is there, or even within food, is there some sector you would start with like some  sub-sector like, wow, that would be good from what I know now would be amazing to do bananas  
**[0:40:58-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:40:58):**  everywhere in Europe, or it would be amazing to do meat or something like that or cell  phones, I mean, it could be.  Yeah, I would say is also there is different products and there is from two pricing perspective,  different themes that you can get started with.  Do you start with soil?  
**[0:41:14-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:14):**  Do you start with climate?  Do you start with pesticides?  Do you start with living wages?  I would say, yeah, I would probably start with fruit agri and climate because I feel  that the time is really right for it.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:28):**  And then could be that a few years from now, this could be technically possible and a few  years more down the line, it would be normal.  Normal, yeah.  So we're talking less than 10 years.  That's what I hear.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:39):**  Yeah.  And now also thinking about living wages, just covering this gap.  So the living wage is also a framework which is quite well developed to say, okay, these  are at least the cost of a decent standard of living.  And they're not being met by the economy in this world, in this year.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:41:59):**  The gap is so small.  When you bring it back to our products, the gap is so small.  But of course, if you would think 30 cents for a t-shirt, if you talk about cotton farming,  then it would be double the price out of the factory.  And that also translates through the value chain, through many multipliers to also double  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:19):**  the cost of a t-shirt.  So actually just starting with 30 cents extra wage.  And I think that is a technological challenge that I think we should be able to solve.  And it's an investment that I think would pay itself back because there is a hunger  for buying products by consumers, but you don't have to worry about the social implications.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:42:39):**  You don't have to worry about environmental implications.  So if I would translate your answer of what would you invest in, it would be a portfolio  of companies, maybe starting them or help them get off the ground or investing in larger  ones and transition them with mandatory true pricing where consumers can buy the things  they are normally anyway buying and not have to worry at all about the environmental and  
**[0:43:00-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:00):**  social costs.  I think it's also about making the technology available that any company could use to track  the carbon, track the wages, show them to the consumer and allow the consumer then to  pay if they want.  And then it could be that the retailer could decide to pay it off themselves without even  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:18):**  offering the consumer this choice.  Which is up to the retailer.  Yeah.  Which is up to the, I mean, they have their impact goals as well and are hungry for ways  to show things.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:29):**  And so we need to give them that.  I think it's a great way to end this conversation.  I think there's a lot more to discuss.  We'll definitely check in before the next Black Friday because you're constantly launching  things and it feels like the moment has come.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:43):**  It's still very small.  I mean, one shop in Amsterdam, a lot of internal discussions, a few cafes, a few places, but  it's so much more than a few years ago when I started following this movement that it's  very, I mean, if this is an exponential growth curve, we should be happy about it because  it seems that, I mean, with the big reports on the food costs or the cost of the food  
**[0:43:59-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:43:59):**  system, both globally and in the US, we should start waking up about, especially the social  costs and of course the environmental costs.  So thank you so much for your time.  I want to say one thing, Kud.  I want to say one thing because I looked it up.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:13):**  Most people don't know that the GDP was invented in 1937, that's 100 years ago.  And it was became the world standard in 1944, the global gross domestic product.  And it was never meant to be the world standard for like the one thing that we all look at  if we're doing okay as a country or not is that, but I don't think that the inventors  never did it that way.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:35):**  But also like it's a young thing.  And if we think long-term, we can reimagine the way we do accounting.  The international accounting standard for companies.  So the way the companies accounts for costs became a global standard in 1973, which means  why in 2030 or 25, there should not be a true cost accounting standard, which is actually  
**[0:44:57-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:44:57):**  the global standard.  That's how you define profit loss, environmental costs, social costs.  I think we'll look back at that and think, of course, it's a, so it's very, that's very  interesting.  It's very young, but it comes back to your opening point, almost like an holistic approach  
**[0:45:10-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:10):**  here and not an unintended consequences, because I'm pretty sure the GDP inventors or the first  people that wrote about it didn't intend it to be the one and only Holy grail that we  all focus on.  And if that goes down, somehow we're all losing.  But as you made it very clear, I mean, less is also interesting, especially in the global  
**[0:45:27-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:27):**  North.  So it became something much bigger than they could ever imagined and got us off to the  races basically in the wrong way.  So it's, we need to be careful also with this because there could be unintended consequences  of the true cost accounting.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:40):**  Actually a final question.  That's never the final question.  What do you see as potential risks here?  Yeah, of course.  What you said, there's always a blind spot when you put your eyes on something and then  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:45:49):**  it takes 10 years for it to become a global standard.  If you're lucky.  And then once the global standard, the world has already changed and then you maybe have  a blind spot or maybe you have a blind spot from the beginning.  I think to not have blind spot, the best way to do is to develop this thing with a participative  
**[0:46:04-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:46:04):**  approach.  So not just a group of people in universities or in a research center, but involve civil  society, involve government, involve business and involve grassroots organizations.  Yeah.  The people that are actually on the ground.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:46:23):**  So I think the risk is that it becomes monopolized by a small group of people, the way the new  standards made.  And then we're going to be indeed going towards next crisis without realizing for a while.  We're going to be in deep trouble.  Yeah.

**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:47:35):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course after a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of  audio asking the question how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been  following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was  
**[0:47:57-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:47:57):**  time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:48:10):**  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  
**[0:48:18-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:48:18):**  For whom is this course?  You the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  designers, holistic management, consultants, et cetera, et cetera.

So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:49:11-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:11):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:24):**  We're going to look into why investing regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in and what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could  find if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:49:46-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:49:46):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/pietro-galgani#t=0:50:00):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.

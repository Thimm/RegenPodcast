**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:14):**  Hardly ever talked about in agriculture, let alone in regenerative agriculture circles.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:19):**  The labour challenges.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:20):**  Around the world millions of people are exploited to pick our table grapes, tomatoes, lettuces,  
**[0:00:25-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:25):**  peaches, etc.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:27):**  We don't like to think about it, but unless we quote on quote fix the labour issue, we  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:31):**  will never have enough skilled people working on regenerative diversified farms.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:36):**  We can't simply say don't worry about it, robots will take care of it.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:39):**  Because spoiler alert, they won't and especially not in specialty crops like fruit trees and  
**[0:00:44-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:44):**  anything perennial.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:46):**  Learn more about this hidden issue and more importantly the potential of a venture studio  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:50):**  in this space building companies, building collaborative automation agtech.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:00:55):**  Not to replace farm workers, but to make their jobs less heavy.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:01:03):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:01:07):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:01:08):**  Where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space to learn more on  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:01:13):**  how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:01:18):**  while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:01:22):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:01:25):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:01:28):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:01:33):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:37-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:01:37):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:08):**  Welcome to another episode today with the co-founder of Farmhand Ventures, a venture  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:11):**  studio building companies redesigning the future of work in agriculture.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:16):**  Welcome Connie.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:17):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:18):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:20):**  And there's a lot of back already in that little, little title or little subtitle, but  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:26):**  I always like to start with the question, you know, because you're a regular listener  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:30):**  of the show, what brought you to soil?  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:32):**  And then of course, what brought you specific to the labor issue in soil and in agriculture?  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:36):**  But let's say what brought you to agriculture and food to begin with?  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:39):**  Sure.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:40):**  Okay.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:41):**  I'll, I'll step all the way back on this and I'm going to talk maybe less about soil than  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:44):**  like most of your guests.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:46):**  Cause my assumption is that almost everyone listening to this like gets it, gets that  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:50):**  soil really matters.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:52):**  So first-  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:53):**  If you don't, we have like 180 plus episodes to listen to, 185 I think we're now.  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:02:59):**  There are some, some, there's some great books and documentaries, but if you like, let's,  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:03):**  let's all agree we're in this, in this room now and we know soil matters.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:06):**  It does definitely.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:07):**  And yeah.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:08):**  So for me, I got into ag because I love food.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:12):**  So I actually worked in restaurants.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:13):**  I debated doing the kind of culinary career trajectory instead of, you know, college university.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:21):**  But you know, grew up in the New York city suburbs.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:24):**  My family has farm land in Iowa that we at work very much absentee landowners.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:32):**  But yeah, grew up in the burbs.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:34):**  So went to college was, was good, always good at math as a kid.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:37):**  So did engineer, studied engineering.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:41):**  And I think that, and have also always been very motivated by conservation.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:46):**  I'm a, I'm a big fan of the Bronx Zoo.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:50):**  I just like was super nerdy about all that stuff as a young person.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:55):**  And so I think the intersection of those things, right?  
**[0:03:57-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:03:57):**  Caring about planetary confines, caring about food both the quality of it and accessibility.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:04:05):**  And part of the reason I also didn't go into the, just working in restaurants is as much  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:04:11):**  fun as it is and as valuable as I think it is societally.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:04:17):**  I didn't want to just serve rich people all day.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:04:20):**  And so that intersect that with engineering and boom, you get ag tech actually.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:04:26):**  So I also, basically I took a series of kind of loosely thought out things that landed  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:04:35):**  me early in the kind of ag tech venture capital movement.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:04:38):**  So I did this entrepreneurial fellowship program after graduating college called Venture for  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:04:46):**  America.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:04:47):**  And that is how I ended up working, moving to St. Louis.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:04:51):**  So moving to the Midwest of the US, which if you had told me as a kid that I would ever  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:04:57):**  live anywhere, but like the Northeast or maybe Bay area, I would have laughed at you.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:05:03):**  And I am now a pretty big advocate for, yeah, everywhere else actually almost everywhere  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:05:09):**  is pretty darn interesting.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:05:13):**  And so I ended up moving to St. Louis and being one of the early employees at the Yield  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:05:19):**  Lab, which at the time was one of the first ag tech accelerators, an experiment at the  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:05:26):**  time.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:05:27):**  And it's really grown and turned into an international family of impact venture capital funds, investing  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:05:32):**  exclusively in agri-food technology.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:05:36):**  So building that straight from the deep end has been super influential and shaped how  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:05:43):**  I've looked at things.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:05:47):**  But another really key thing that, so I came into agriculture really thinking about the  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:05:54):**  sustainability side of food and the environment, specifically as it relates to environmental  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:06:00):**  stuff.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:06:01):**  I hadn't had at that time very much exposure to poverty, racism, all of these kind of socioeconomical,  
**[0:06:12-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:06:12):**  sociopolitical issues that are really, really real and actually that are super intertwined  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:06:21):**  in our agri-food system.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:06:24):**  And so now I've arrived, so still looking at the, okay, soil really matters scientifically.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:06:31):**  I'm a super science geek.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:06:33):**  I'm the kind of person who is going to read all of the long form peer reviewed articles  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:06:39):**  and critique the methodology and those.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:06:42):**  So that's why soil matters, right?  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:06:44):**  It does.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:06:47):**  But how do you actually make that fit into the reality that is political and economic?  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:06:56):**  You have to integrate people into that system.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:06:58):**  So I have kind of shifted my mindset into thinking about, wait, why do we have an agri-food  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:04):**  system?  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:05):**  We have it to serve people.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:06):**  And why do we have one that doesn't lead to great soil health if you want to take the  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:11):**  geeky outcome?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:12):**  Well, sure.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:13):**  Let's explore that a little bit further because I came into this thinking, okay, Monsanto,  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:20):**  agribusiness, big corporates are the bad guys.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:23):**  But they're actually, it's much more nuanced than that.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:26):**  I don't know that I believe that at all.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:30):**  I can see arguments for it, but I don't know that I believe it at all.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:36):**  There's really big challenges right now.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:38):**  I live in St. Louis still, down the street from me, specifically across the street.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:43):**  And we have different red line neighborhoods.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:45):**  The food desert issue is extremely real.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:49):**  The access to fresh produce, nutrition, even to a dozen of eggs that is affordable, that  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:07:55):**  challenge is not even close to being sort of addressed.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:08:01):**  And it's obviously tied to our agricultural systems, but less directly than you might  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:08:07):**  think, actually.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:08:09):**  The other side of that that I have been exposed to through working on farms, so I have done  
**[0:08:17-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:08:17):**  a fair bit of woofing in France and in Oregon, but then more industrially, I've worked with  
**[0:08:25-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:08:25):**  a farmland investment fund in Oregon, actually managing crews of about 100 seasonal workers  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:08:33):**  during blueberry and hemp harvest season.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:08:37):**  And actually working with those people alongside them and supervising them and understanding  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:08:43):**  the economic constraints that they face in their everyday life.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:08:47):**  And also like having done the labor.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:08:51):**  I've worked in restaurants, that's hard, right?  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:08:53):**  Working in farms, way harder, way harder.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:08:56):**  Physically, it's mental.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:08:58):**  It's physically draining.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:09:00):**  It's mentally challenging.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:09:05):**  The unskilled work thing is total nonsense because no one moves faster than farm workers  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:09:12):**  and it's totally skill based.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:09:14):**  You feel like it's very hard to pick lettuce very quickly, actually, without hurting yourself  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:09:20):**  in the long run.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:09:23):**  So all of this kind of exposure has shifted my thinking on...  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:09:28):**  So soil matters, yes.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:09:30):**  But what matters more than soil, actually, is the people who are involved in the system  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:09:34):**  and why does soil matter?  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:09:37):**  And to me, people are just another animal on this kind of planet Earth, right?  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:09:41):**  And so soil matters because it matters for us, actually.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:09:47):**  It matters for us to have biodiversity for all of the good reasons associated with that.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:09:51):**  Again, listen to a bunch of former episodes.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:09:54):**  But in order to address that issue, we have to look at people first and we have to look  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:10:00):**  at the people who are affected by agri-food systems, which are both the people working  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:10:06):**  in that system from farm workers to landowners and farmers and everyone in between.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:10:13):**  And we have to look at the people who are served or not served by that system.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:10:19):**  And so that is how I kind of arose at labor.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:10:24):**  So I've been trying to kind of figure out how do you address the people element of the  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:10:28):**  system in such a way that works for kind of everyone involved in this like regenerative  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:10:34):**  ag movement, so to speak.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:10:37):**  And I think the answer is by focusing on the labor element, which I would make a strong  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:10:44):**  case for it being the single biggest bottleneck to actually changing agricultural systems  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:10:51):**  to be more regenerative, diverse, etc.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:10:55):**  Why is that?  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:10:56):**  Like, is that blocking?  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:10:59):**  Because we hear this constant move, okay, we do much more with less, we have better,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:05):**  bigger machines, there's only 2% of the population or whatever percentage is involved directly  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:10):**  in agriculture.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:11):**  We know that's partly not true, because there are massive labor forces needed to pick a  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:16):**  lot of things.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:17):**  And like you mentioned before, in brutal circumstances, very badly paid on their very, let's say high  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:25):**  doses of the chemicals, the sun, everything we throw at them, because we want this very,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:30):**  very cheap, very cheap, very cheap food.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:34):**  So it seems like an incredible, difficult issue to unpack.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:39):**  You said, let's start there.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:40):**  But then why is that a limiting factor for regenerative ag or for the things we have  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:45):**  discussed in all the other episodes?  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:47):**  Like why is labor a limiting factor to diversify or to change soil practices at the end or  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:54):**  to change how we manage our land?  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:56):**  A good question, couple of answers.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:11:58):**  I'll start practically and then I'll go farther out into like a more radical vision.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:12:03):**  So practically, so from like more of a sustainable ag tech, almost everyone in the agricultural  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:12:08):**  industry, no matter where you sit on the spectrum can get on board with side.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:12:13):**  Adoption is not happening of novel agriculture technology as quickly as it needs to be happening  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:12:21):**  if we want all the invested dollars to result in positive outcomes.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:12:25):**  Right.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:12:26):**  Why is that?  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:12:28):**  I am fairly certain that a big component of that is because the technology is not being  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:12:34):**  designed for the user.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:12:36):**  It's kind of that simple.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:12:39):**  And also there's a lack of appreciation for various incentives, often perverse incentives  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:12:47):**  along the cut that the customer faces.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:12:50):**  So if you're selling to a farmer, you got to think about the landowner.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:12:54):**  If you're and also if you're selling to a farmer, a product that makes the farm workers  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:13:00):**  job easier, you need to realize that probably that farmer, that farmer might be thinking  
**[0:13:06-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:13:06):**  about retaining that farm worker.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:13:08):**  But because of various structures that are in place.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:13:11):**  So I'll talk about the US specifically here.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:13:15):**  But this is actually true in most countries.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:13:18):**  When you look at the history of labor and agriculture starts with slavery.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:13:23):**  So that's not good.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:13:25):**  And that's still happening in other places in the world, by the way.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:13:32):**  So it's and then it evolves into sharecropping and it evolves.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:13:37):**  Oh, so not good.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:13:38):**  It has it's like current iteration is largely employing, but on an on a contract basis.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:13:46):**  So without benefits, employing folks who have typically less than full citizenship rights  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:13:51):**  probably have some language barriers, probably are different ethnicities than the majority  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:13:57):**  in that region and are therefore very easily exploited.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:14:03):**  And so that is the group of people who gets the fresh food and the weeds and the prune  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:14:09):**  like gets all of the stuff done on farms.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:14:12):**  And that group of people has a very limited voice in what we're actually designing to  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:14:21):**  make that farm system more efficient.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:14:25):**  Especially from a technology perspective, I don't think.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:14:29):**  And anybody building, I would say almost any ag tech, maybe 99 out of 100 has ever taken  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:14:36):**  a farm worker like already you did really well if you did long interviews with farmers.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:14:42):**  But if you or maybe your landowners, maybe to understand that kind of incentive structure  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:14:45):**  and what is needed, et cetera.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:14:47):**  But I've yet to hear somebody says, no, I really I went in the field.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:14:50):**  First of all, I went to to harvest these melons.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:14:52):**  And then we figured out this and this technology to to help or to and even what does help there  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:14:57):**  mean?  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:14:58):**  So you're saying, unless we acknowledge that there is a massive, extremely exploited, in  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:04):**  most cases, extremely easily exploited labor force underpinning this ag system, we're never  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:10):**  going to design solutions, let alone technologies that actually serve or fix them.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:15):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:16):**  And then if you get that, take it a step further and say, okay, in regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:22):**  what do we want to see?  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:24):**  We want to see fewer chemicals.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:26):**  What's the alternative to herbicides, manual weeding, more labor, we want to see greater  
**[0:15:32-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:32):**  diversity of crops.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:33):**  So more rotation, less monoculture.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:37):**  How do you mechanize something that's constantly changing?  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:39):**  How do you fully automate that?  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:41):**  It's technically very difficult and expensive.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:45):**  We want to see more, like all of these things that we want to see more of, and regenerative  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:52):**  systems require more hands on the job.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:15:56):**  And so I think that, you know, in my utopic future, I  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:16:02):**  Yeah, because it's a question like, how would that be done?  
**[0:16:04-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:16:04):**  Is there a space, let's say, or have you seen farms at scale that sort of provide that year  
**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:16:11):**  on job, first of all, enough benefits, etc, that you can actually hire somebody properly,  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:16:18):**  retain somebody, train, etc.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:16:20):**  And like, do the system provide that kind of margins or returns or whatever we want  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:16:25):**  to call it to, to provide that and make sure somebody like this large labor force is not  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:16:30):**  moving constantly from one region to another, to pick x and then y and z and then rotates  
**[0:16:36-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:16:36):**  back sort of like a big migration, but a very bad one.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:16:39):**  Yeah, I mean, well, the other element of this, of course, is economics, right?  
**[0:16:43-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:16:43):**  Like you need that.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:16:44):**  And I want it like, this is a very, the reason people don't pay a lot of attention to ag  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:16:50):**  labor is it's such a political hot button issue, and it gets messy, and it's human based,  
**[0:16:55-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:16:55):**  so it's hard, but which is also the reason I want to try to do what I can in it.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:17:02):**  But thinking about the farmer, right, because I have spent a lot of time trying to work  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:17:10):**  with and learn from farmers.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:17:13):**  And there is a very wide spectrum in terms of farmer quality.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:17:19):**  And yeah, without getting into all sorts of like land inheritance issues there, there  
**[0:17:25-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:17:25):**  are a lot of really good farmers, right?  
**[0:17:28-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:17:28):**  Farms need to be sustainable businesses.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:17:31):**  And by sustainable, I mean economically sustainable businesses.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:17:35):**  And the challenge is happening right now.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:17:38):**  And like, this is why I'm doing what I'm doing right now.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:17:41):**  The cost of labor is increasing faster than the inflation, you know, food costs is trickling  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:17:51):**  down to farmers revenue, right?  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:17:54):**  So bottom line is increasing, top line is barely increasing.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:17:59):**  And that creates a problem.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:18:01):**  And so you've got situations where today, it no longer makes economic sense to harvest  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:18:07):**  certain crops.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:18:08):**  If you look at asparagus in the UK, strawberries are getting a lot of attention right now.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:18:13):**  But the other part of that is the waste side of things.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:18:21):**  So it doesn't make sense to harvest slightly lower quality crops, or, and this becomes  
**[0:18:28-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:18:28):**  the challenge with having hyper concentrated single crop systems in one region, what you  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:18:36):**  end up having is a maturity and ripe, you know, everything is all the blueberries are  
**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:18:40):**  ripe the same couple of weeks, right?  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:18:43):**  And so that packer who all those farmers have to sell those blueberries to can drive down  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:18:48):**  the price during those weeks when they're actually in season.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:18:52):**  And so there's all these really complex pricing demand dynamics at play.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:18:56):**  So it makes it really hard, actually, in my mind, to get to a lot of these idealistic,  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:02):**  regenerative, kind of even permaculture incorporating type agricultural systems.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:09):**  I think that the only way to do that is through integrating some component of automation.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:16):**  But when I say automation, to be very clear, I don't mean a human free system.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:22):**  I think over everything, but that's the solution, right?  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:25):**  We just unleash the drones and then we'll be fine.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:29):**  Just let the robots take over.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:30):**  Wally will do it.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:32):**  But no, I mean, that's not that's not going to like also like, I'm not a great engineer.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:37):**  I only studied engineering academically.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:39):**  I've been in finance most of the time.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:41):**  But like, I know enough to be like, yeah, like if chances when when systems are completely  
**[0:19:47-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:47):**  economically infeasible.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:50):**  Like that's cool.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:51):**  That's a fun problem to solve.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:52):**  That is not a good investment for anyone.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:19:55):**  And so what I think we're starting to see actually, as people are starting to realize  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:00):**  that this labor crisis is, is in fact a crisis.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:04):**  And it's interesting.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:05):**  It's not going away.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:06):**  It's getting worse.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:07):**  It's getting worse.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:08):**  It's a thing.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:09):**  It's a thing.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:10):**  It's not it's magically next year.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:11):**  Yeah, it's only going to get worse.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:12):**  When you like we can I can do a whole kind of seminar on all of the macroeconomic trends  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:20):**  that are changing.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:21):**  And this is going to you know, it's it ends up it is geographically specific.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:25):**  Like if you look at the US context, Mexico birth rates are declining.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:29):**  So immigration, immigration rates are declining that matters because the majority of agricultural  
**[0:20:33-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:33):**  workforce in the US it seasonal workforce in the US is Mexican at this moment.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:40):**  You look at like what we're trying to do in terms of workforce modernization and some  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:45):**  things seem to be stuck from a legislative standpoint.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:50):**  And yeah, so so there's no relief in sight from and the other really big challenge here  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:20:59):**  is this is where like often I think in these regenerative conversations, we talk about  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:04):**  increasing food prices, right?  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:06):**  If we increase food prices, the people who pick our food can't afford food.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:12):**  And they probably already can't they already can't actually a big chunk of it.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:18):**  Right.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:19):**  So if we talk about collaborative automation, what is that?  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:23):**  What are examples that walk us through visually because of course, we're in an audio podcast  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:29):**  like what would what are what are things out there already that would make some people  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:34):**  that they think differently about attack and robotics because I know many people were cringe  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:38):**  listening to this and listening to like, technology is going to save us but there's a very important  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:43):**  role there.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:44):**  But what do you mean when you say collaborative automation?  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:48):**  So I actually mostly right now for the next five years or so mean the stupid kind of technology  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:55):**  and I'll explain what I mean by that.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:21:56):**  So one of our studio portfolio companies is a company called Future Acres.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:22:04):**  And what Future Acres does is it mechanizes fresh crop transport.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:22:08):**  So what does that really mean?  
**[0:22:10-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:22:10):**  Today, if if you're harvesting table grapes, right, the workers will pick table grapes  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:22:17):**  manually clip them, put them in the wagon.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:22:20):**  When the wagon is full, they take the wagon to the central way station, then they go back  
**[0:22:24-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:22:24):**  into the row, keep picking, you waste 30 to 40% of your time walking back and forth with  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:22:32):**  loads of grapes.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:22:33):**  If you had a with with Future Acres product carry, the wheelbarrow says, Hey, I'm getting  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:22:40):**  kind of heavy over here, please come pick up the grapes.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:22:44):**  And so a little wagon comes over, worker just has to load the grapes onto that wagon, wagon  
**[0:22:50-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:22:50):**  goes back to central way station.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:22:52):**  That becomes very interesting also from a data capture future opportunities perspective.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:22:58):**  But from a like in this moment solve a problem now perspective, you are not displacing the  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:23:05):**  people doing the hard like it is it's actually technically very difficult to pick table grapes  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:23:12):**  in particular, like that's a really complicated geometry to deal with, right?  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:23:18):**  No robotic arm will do that very soon at any kind of scale or level we can imagine.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:23:23):**  Yeah, well, maybe, maybe, maybe.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:23:27):**  But the challenge really becomes vision.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:23:30):**  And again, it becomes the diversity of fields because I so I mentioned table grapes for  
**[0:23:38-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:23:38):**  that example, because Future Acres is that's their first kind of addressable market.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:23:45):**  But what's interesting about that Future Acres model is it scales across crops, which is  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:23:51):**  something that is really unusual in the world of agricultural automation.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:23:56):**  And even when you look at us table grapes are interesting, they're relatively uniform  
**[0:24:03-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:24:03):**  as a crop.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:24:05):**  But I know blueberries very well, right?  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:24:07):**  So when I look, I can tell you why we had different management practices across three  
**[0:24:12-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:24:12):**  different farms, essentially, within two different counties in the same region in Oregon.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:24:19):**  And each field was slightly different.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:24:22):**  And those differences present a challenge and an additional cost for scaling any kind  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:24:28):**  of vision solution, right?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:24:31):**  And so this is a problem that's important to point out in the context of agricultural  
**[0:24:38-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:24:38):**  robotics, because, and this gets into the whole kind of capital stack side of everything.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:24:46):**  It is very expensive.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:24:48):**  And because it's technically difficult to scale most very specific, automated solutions  
**[0:24:57-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:24:57):**  across different crop types.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:24:59):**  It's expensive even to do it across regions in different fields.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:03):**  And it just gets even worse when you try to do it across different crops.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:06):**  And that's a really big problem in my mind, because I usually sit on the capital allocation  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:11):**  side of things in the venture capital world, right?  
**[0:25:14-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:14):**  And you need that skill, you need that, because otherwise you're limited to a very small crop  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:21):**  and does a very small time of year across a long time period, actually.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:26):**  And you end up with a situation where everyone's harvesting at the same time.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:30):**  So you can't, you know, effectively ship your robots to be used at different points in time  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:34):**  in the year.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:35):**  And  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:36):**  How do you get over that?  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:39):**  Like why, if that's such a specific issue?  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:43):**  This is where Farmhand Ventures is interested.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:45):**  So there's two different ways to do it.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:47):**  Simple solutions, stupid simple solutions.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:48):**  But there's two ways to do it.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:49):**  There's either, actually, it's not either, it's both.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:54):**  Stupid simple solutions, those are the things that will scale across crops, multiple types  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:25:59):**  of crops, and being pragmatic and realistic.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:26:04):**  And so what I think we need is to invest in many solutions that are 95 to 99% technically  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:26:12):**  identical.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:26:13):**  But with that five, one to 5% on top, that makes it crop specific, and that one to 5%  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:26:20):**  might be pretty costly.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:26:22):**  And so that's where it's very important to really understand the total addressable market  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:26:27):**  that that technology realistically can address.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:26:31):**  And so at Farmhand Ventures, that's kind of what we're thinking about when we build companies.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:26:37):**  We are looking for opportunities that are crop specific, actually.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:26:43):**  And we realize that in doing so, we are actually limiting our total addressable market for  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:26:49):**  some of these solutions.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:26:51):**  And that can actually be okay.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:26:53):**  Because then if you step back outside of robotics even, and you say, okay, again, from a venture  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:26:59):**  capitalist standpoint, what do exits look like in ag tech right now?  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:27:04):**  They're generally, they're very few billion dollar exits, there aren't many unicorns.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:27:09):**  They're generally acquisitions.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:27:12):**  And in fact, they're generally under 100 million in terms of successful exits even.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:27:19):**  You could say like the Blue River 305 million is like the top most for like ag robotics  
**[0:27:25-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:27:25):**  probably that has happened.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:27:26):**  And like, arguably that that probably won't happen again for some time.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:27:30):**  That was pretty high valuation for that.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:27:33):**  And so then I sit back again as a, you know, fund manager type person who likes math, and  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:27:42):**  say, all right, well, how can I deliver effective?  
**[0:27:46-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:27:46):**  How can we as an investment community even put capital towards solutions that will have  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:27:53):**  a positive impact and make money off of them?  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:27:57):**  And we totally can.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:27:59):**  But one thing that's really important to do in doing that is being realistic and pragmatic  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:28:04):**  about what the likely end scenario is, because then you have to reverse engineer and say,  
**[0:28:09-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:28:09):**  how can I structure an investment entity such that it, I either have a large enough ownership  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:28:17):**  percentage, or I am doing alternative mechanisms for investment, such as revenue based investment,  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:28:24):**  as opposed to pure equity based.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:28:27):**  And like, that that is something I can talk all day about, because like, we need so much  
**[0:28:32-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:28:32):**  more of that to invest in the things that actually solve the problems in agri food systems.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:28:39):**  And to just double click, I mean, there's a lot to unpack there on the studio model,  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:28:43):**  obviously, but to unpack, to double click on this, the stupid solution for a table grapes,  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:28:49):**  like how does that trajectory look like?  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:28:50):**  Is it going to be then other types of grapes?  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:28:54):**  Is it going to be really specific?  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:28:55):**  Is the table grape industry big enough to support a good exit company, let's say, or  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:00):**  is it going to go to I just mentioned the blueberry side or the peaches side?  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:04):**  Like how have you planned?  
**[0:29:06-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:06):**  Obviously, we have to look how that actually plays out.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:09):**  But how have you planned that trajectory for that for that company?  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:13):**  Okay, I'm going to do a weird thing and give kind of like a shout out to competitors to  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:17):**  that company, because like borough is arguably is the first mover in the US in this space,  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:23):**  they have a sort of similar platform, it's a bit different, technically.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:28):**  But there I and I mentioned them, and there's a couple of newcomers, actually a bunch in  
**[0:29:34-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:34):**  the EU right now who are very early stage that are again, addressing the crop transport  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:43):**  problem.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:44):**  In the field.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:45):**  Right in the field.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:47):**  And that's a problem across every crop.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:51):**  I think that there will be multiple, there is space for multiple solutions to generate  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:29:56):**  substantial revenue in that across multiple crops.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:30:02):**  One question I think that all of these companies and future acres is an early stage company.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:30:08):**  And so so I will see where we go on this.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:30:12):**  But one question is, do you focus on verticalizing kind of within one crop and actually saying,  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:30:23):**  okay, we can do these things for table grape growers, we can we are in a very, we're very  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:30:28):**  well positioned to capture this extra data that can then enable us to do these other  
**[0:30:33-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:30:33):**  things kind of further down the supply chain of the table grape or up?  
**[0:30:40-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:30:40):**  Do you focus on that?  
**[0:30:41-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:30:41):**  And do you expand your revenue opportunity revenue base just within table grapes?  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:30:49):**  Or do you say, okay, actually, we can just dump a fleet of these robots with a very minor  
**[0:30:54-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:30:54):**  adjustment into stone fruit into Pinot, so the some some, some wine grapes, not most,  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:05):**  most are mechanically harvested already.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:08):**  And and into, you know, blueberries and other soft fruits.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:14):**  And that's a question and I don't really know what the answer is yet.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:17):**  And we're deciding on that approach right now.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:21):**  And from a studio model, why did you choose the studio model to instead of quote unquote,  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:29):**  raising an ag tech focused on the labor problem funds and just do seed and proceed and go  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:35):**  with with that?  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:37):**  Is that like, what was the what's the reasoning behind that?  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:40):**  Apart from that, we have to see way more experimentation also on the how to deploy capital and how  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:45):**  to build company sites.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:46):**  I'm very happy with that.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:47):**  So what's the what's the reasoning behind it from from your side from the operating  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:51):**  side?  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:52):**  A couple of things.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:53):**  So one on a value, purely values basis, right?  
**[0:31:56-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:56):**  I want to see more diversity.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:31:59):**  I want to see more, a better spread of wealth.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:32:04):**  And I think one pathway to that is having greater socio economic diversity on the cap  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:32:11):**  table, on an equity owner basis, right.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:32:15):**  And right now, it is incredibly difficult for someone who's not rich, to afford to be  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:32:21):**  able to take the risk of starting a company or being one of the first five employees at  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:32:26):**  a fast growth company, right?  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:32:29):**  That's that's just not feasible for someone who doesn't have a cushion for the most part.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:32:33):**  Of course, there are some exceptions.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:32:35):**  The studio model enables us to pay someone to work on a high risk venture, and to actually  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:32:43):**  bring them back in if and when that high risk venture fails, which is part of the reality  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:32:48):**  of startups, and to allocate them to another venture.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:32:53):**  So it is worth trying from a values basis just on that premise to me.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:33:00):**  Way more inclusive, way more inclusive, way more accessible.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:33:03):**  Exactly.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:33:04):**  Make startups accessible is a concise way to say that.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:33:08):**  And also, as when we look specifically at hardware in agriculture, we I mean, that's  
**[0:33:18-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:33:18):**  tough.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:33:19):**  That's not a fit for most venture capital.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:33:21):**  When you're saying it's a fit for some kind of deep tech models.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:33:25):**  But when you say I'm a venture capital fund, and you have the option to invest in FinTech  
**[0:33:31-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:33:31):**  software for ag versus agro robotics software for specialty crops, there's no way that as  
**[0:33:39-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:33:39):**  a VC fund manager with a set number of dollars to invest, I don't know how you justify investing  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:33:46):**  in that collaborative robotics investment that's going to take longer, need more capital  
**[0:33:51-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:33:51):**  to bring to market and have a limited addressable market, relatively speaking.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:33:57):**  And also, societally, we really, really need to invest in that stuff.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:04):**  But I think that by having a very thesis specific studio, and by creating a portfolio of companies  
**[0:34:16-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:16):**  that is actually somewhat collaborative.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:19):**  So I think that most people will look at farmhand venture, most people outside of agriculture,  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:25):**  will look at farmhand venture's portfolio and say, what the heck, they're invested in  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:29):**  a bunch of competitors.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:31):**  But that's not at all because we'll have a blueberry company and a grape company and  
**[0:34:37-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:37):**  an apple company.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:38):**  And they're so different.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:39):**  And they're so vastly different.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:41):**  But at the same time, the engineering is very similar.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:45):**  And so we will be able to leverage substantial efficiencies there, right?  
**[0:34:51-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:51):**  Except for that last one to 5%.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:53):**  Exactly.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:54):**  And then there's the other one that's on top.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:55):**  But yeah, that's very interesting.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:34:56):**  The basis, a lot of that can be just in a venture studio, you share part of the accounting,  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:02):**  you share a lot of the back end stuff, you can actually share a lot of the engineering  
**[0:35:05-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:05):**  stuff as well.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:06):**  I never thought about that.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:07):**  And like, yeah, a big part of it is like, the way I look at kind of everything is like,  
**[0:35:13-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:13):**  all right, like, this is an experiment.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:15):**  We're going to try to create the next generation of ag equipment companies.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:23):**  And we might sprinkle in a couple software companies in there.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:26):**  But for the most part, our focus is on accomplishing that.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:31):**  And the model just follows that goal, right?  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:35):**  And so how many are you targeting?  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:38):**  How many are you planning to build?  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:40):**  And where are you now?  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:41):**  Let's say we're at the end of the summer in the northern hemisphere in 2022, the end of  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:46):**  August, what is the current status?  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:50):**  So we're super early stage.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:51):**  I'm also going to be somewhat vague here to avoid any SEC challenges.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:35:58):**  But we are, we have basically one company that is being that is transferred into the  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:36:06):**  portfolio.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:36:09):**  We are building the rest of the project here and we'll have more announcements to follow  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:36:16):**  hopefully later this year, but, you know, realistically, possibly in early 2023.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:36:22):**  And what are like exciting sectors?  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:36:26):**  Like what is like having been building one and getting close to some others?  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:36:31):**  What are some very overlooked pieces like table grapes?  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:36:34):**  For sure, probably it's the first time we ever discussed it on this podcast.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:36:37):**  But what are other, even say sub sectors, but other pieces you really get excited about  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:36:43):**  and almost wish there would be more if you're building a company in that space, more competitors,  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:36:47):**  like what are you excited about in that collaborative automation space?  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:36:53):**  I think honestly, there's not very, the other, I guess this is the other reason why the studio,  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:36:59):**  I don't see that many early stage companies right now.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:05):**  Externally that are super exciting.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:08):**  Because everyone is chasing venture dollars, because that's what's available for the most  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:13):**  part.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:14):**  There are exceptions.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:15):**  Like you look at like Gus spraying, I think that's a really cool company.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:18):**  How are they called?  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:21):**  Gus Automation, I believe, like Gus Spray or Gus Automation, but basically they built  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:26):**  autonomous spray spraying robots for specialty crops.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:31):**  I believe they're based in California, Central Valley, California.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:35):**  And I don't know them really beyond watching a lot of videos on YouTube, but they were  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:38):**  born out of a spraying services provider, right?  
**[0:37:43-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:43):**  So they just solved their own problem.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:45):**  And it turns out that now instead of having to have people drive tractors with sprayers  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:51):**  on the back, they can watch their robot do it.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:37:55):**  So you're saying the model of investing, the VC model is actually prohibiting to see more  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:02):**  innovation more in especially the specialty crops, because the addressable market, like  
**[0:38:07-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:07):**  what we discussed before, it's easier to invest somewhere else.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:10):**  Is that what you're like, it's missing innovation there because the funding isn't there.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:14):**  Yeah, the funding is kind of not there.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:17):**  And I think, yeah, because when you go through like a quick exercise that says, okay, well,  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:24):**  how big can my addressable market be?  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:27):**  You actually kind of have to cut most specialty crop things.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:30):**  The other really big problem- Because you're not working on soil and the  
**[0:38:33-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:33):**  big acreage where you can do that, where you can do that, that calculates very easily.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:37):**  Look, we have so many millions of acres we can go, we're only capture 0.1%, then we are  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:41):**  all going to be rich.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:43):**  Yes.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:44):**  Although one thing that I do think is actually, and that is really relevant to the soil side  
**[0:38:48-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:48):**  of things that I think is under thought about, but is exciting in specialty crop world is  
**[0:38:55-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:38:55):**  carbon, this is like a real wormhole, but it's carbon monitoring.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:39:01):**  It's my belief, this is a hot take, that it's not technically and economically feasible  
**[0:39:09-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:39:09):**  to measure soil organic carbon via satellite data.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:39:16):**  I don't think that can be done.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:39:19):**  I think you were very clear on measuring because measuring until now, I haven't seen anything  
**[0:39:28-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:39:28):**  yet.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:39:29):**  I think that's another thing, but accuracy is the issue.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:39:33):**  Honestly, Corn Saves America, great podcast by Ag Economic Insights, would recommend if  
**[0:39:39-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:39:39):**  you want to really deep dive on the soil carbon thing as compared to ethanol markets.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:39:45):**  It's real nerdy.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:39:46):**  Without getting too in the weeds there, but there's a solution to that.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:39:52):**  I think the solution is what we should be measuring and the thing that we really care  
**[0:39:55-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:39:55):**  about here is the actual atmospheric flux of carbon dioxide and methane or methane for  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:03):**  the Europeans out there.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:06):**  It's funny, I've started to say methane more often than methane.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:11):**  I don't even know what I say.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:12):**  I'm going to get emails about that as well.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:15):**  You mean the flux above the fields?  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:18):**  Exactly.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:19):**  Because that enables you to account for, and again, measurement is better than modeling.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:25):**  Modeling leads to all sorts of challenges.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:29):**  I'll just keep it short there.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:32):**  It really leads to a lot of challenges.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:36):**  You can do this remotely, like measuring the flux of these emissions or these gases we  
**[0:40:43-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:43):**  would like to measure?  
**[0:40:44-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:45):**  You could almost see the fields breathe basically.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:49):**  That's what you would like to see.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:50):**  That's right.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:51):**  It's all correlated.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:52):**  You do need to understand soil organic carbon and all sorts of other nutrients in the soil  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:57):**  and the biology of the soil actually.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:40:59):**  I'm thinking about this from a soil triangle pyramid standpoint.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:03):**  You've got chemical and physical.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:06):**  Biological is the other part that is the future of soil testing.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:10):**  That also can't be done totally remotely.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:12):**  You're going to have to get dirty at some point is what I'm saying.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:18):**  Can that get a lot cheaper?  
**[0:41:20-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:20):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:21):**  That's a super interesting space.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:23):**  What I'm saying is from a specialty crop and actually from a livestock standpoint, I would  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:28):**  really like for us to move the conversation towards atmospheric monitoring.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:33):**  Ultimately, when we talk about climate change and reaching-  
**[0:41:37-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:37):**  We care about what's up there.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:38):**  Exactly.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:39):**  That's what matters.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:40):**  If we can measure it, why the heck don't we?  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:42):**  Now we can account for above ground biomass, above ground cow burps, whatever.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:48):**  The thing that we don't even know is emitting something because we're not even paying attention  
**[0:41:52-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:52):**  to it.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:54):**  That is possible.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:41:57):**  I work with the Yield Lab Europe as well, which is an impact venture capital fund.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:42:01):**  They're invested in a company called Carbon Space Technology that does this.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:42:10):**  That I think is a really interesting opportunity that isn't in...  
**[0:42:13-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:42:13):**  I think that permanent and specialty crops don't get nearly as much love because it's  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:42:19):**  a small...  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:42:20):**  It's because for good reasons, they're complicated, but they're also a more promising opportunity  
**[0:42:25-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:42:25):**  and they're just better to grow from a net benefit standpoint.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:42:32):**  Trees and perennials generally better from a carbon standpoint and fruits and vegetables  
**[0:42:37-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:42:37):**  generally better than corn.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:42:39):**  The potential is just enormous if you look at...  
**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:42:42):**  I just watched a video just before we started actually on extreme pruning, obviously on  
**[0:42:47-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:42:47):**  a very small scale agroforestry models, the syntropic side of things.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:42:52):**  The possibilities there are immense.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:42:55):**  The labor challenges are immense as well.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:42:59):**  There is some kind of sweet spot there to make it maybe slight...  
**[0:43:02-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:02):**  I'm going to get emails for sure.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:04):**  Slightly less complicated or complex, but still what kind of automation we can...  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:08):**  Collaborative automation because you're never going to automate a syntropic agroforestry  
**[0:43:12-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:12):**  plot, I think with 20 different types that need to be pruning.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:18):**  But you also need a lot of people to have some kind of augmented help there to do it.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:27):**  There's so much potential in perennials that we are not tapping into probably rightfully  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:32):**  so like you said, because there are a few gurus that are really good at it and then  
**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:35):**  a few other people, but if you count them, there are probably a few thousand and that's  
**[0:43:38-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:38):**  it.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:39):**  That's never going to be enough to manage millions of actors.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:42):**  Where is that technology piece and what's being designed there to make those systems  
**[0:43:47-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:47):**  even possible at slightly larger scale than we currently do?  
**[0:43:50-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:50):**  And I think the way that we actually get there, because yeah, all you said is true and I can  
**[0:43:55-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:55):**  think of a bunch of examples too of like, I'm like, oh, that's never going to work on  
**[0:43:59-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:43:59):**  a spreadsheet.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:44:02):**  But the way we can get there is by stopping...  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:44:08):**  We have to stop thinking about labor is unskilled.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:44:12):**  There's no such thing, really, one.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:44:16):**  And it's insulting.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:44:18):**  But if you flip that, you've got farming as a service and kind of crop management services  
**[0:44:28-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:44:28):**  that exist today.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:44:30):**  You've got like, there's all sorts of services like this in row cropping, like the guy who  
**[0:44:36-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:44:36):**  manages my family's land does this across different farms in Iowa today.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:44:40):**  He's a service provider and he's really good at it.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:44:44):**  He's a good farmer.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:44:45):**  He knows his stuff and he treats his clients well.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:44:48):**  Shift that then to specialty crops.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:44:51):**  And again, right now the people who are doing the work are very undervalued.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:44:56):**  And if we could just shift the narrative a little bit such that we said, you know what?  
**[0:45:01-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:01):**  These guys are experts.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:03):**  We have a hazelnut orchard planting crew.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:07):**  They will tell you exactly what it will cost in this region to implement a hazelnut.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:12):**  Because you only plant a hazelnut orchard once, right?  
**[0:45:15-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:15):**  And so you're not very good at it.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:17):**  You're not very efficient.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:18):**  You're never going to be very good at it.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:20):**  Outsource it.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:21):**  It makes way more sense from a land management standpoint to do that.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:25):**  And bring in all the knowledge over decades built up in all the latest papers and paper  
**[0:45:30-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:30):**  reviewed stuff that only the real geeks will read or the latest courses.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:34):**  And yeah, you're right.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:35):**  The perennial one you do once or a few times maybe and you will never reach full capacity  
**[0:45:43-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:43):**  or full potential there because you don't do it daily.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:46):**  You don't learn daily.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:47):**  You don't focus daily on these kinds of systems.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:49):**  Right.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:50):**  So can you get to a future state where these crews are providing services to farms?  
**[0:45:56-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:45:56):**  Because this is the way that row crops work right now from an input standpoint, right?  
**[0:46:00-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:00):**  You've got crop consultants.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:01):**  They tell you what to do.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:02):**  You don't really have to overthink it.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:04):**  It's you're doing what your input provider tells you to do.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:08):**  And right now in row crops, what's the sales channel for most technology?  
**[0:46:14-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:14):**  Input providers.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:16):**  In specialty crops though, you're still going direct to farmer for the most part.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:21):**  Maybe input providers if you're dealing with irrigation and also some chemical stuff.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:26):**  But from a labor standpoint, you're going direct to farmers and you should be going  
**[0:46:32-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:32):**  actually to the labor provider.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:35):**  But the challenge is that that system is so broken right now.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:39):**  It's really hard to get there.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:41):**  But I absolutely can envision a future world where a lot of the services that like in the  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:45):**  US we have an extension service, right?  
**[0:46:47-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:47):**  And so that provides some of these services.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:50):**  It's definitely variable depending on where you are and what crop we're talking about.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:56):**  And it's hard to bring in new crops through this system.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:46:59):**  But you know, it's something.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:47:01):**  It provides a lot of value.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:47:05):**  If you can kind of put some of that expertise into a specialized farm labor workforce and  
**[0:47:12-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:47:12):**  that farm labor workforce then becomes your sales channel and in fact your customer for  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:47:17):**  the next generation of ag equipment companies, then you can actually start to have an experimental  
**[0:47:22-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:47:22):**  group within that workforce that says, hey, you want to, I don't know, do all sorts of  
**[0:47:27-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:47:27):**  funky integrated multi row planting systems.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:47:32):**  We'll try that with you.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:47:33):**  We'll budget it out for you.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:47:35):**  We'll say, here's what it will cost for us to implement this system.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:47:38):**  Do you want to do it?  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:47:40):**  And we'll be there to do it for you, which solves for the major labor risk.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:47:45):**  It doesn't solve for all the risks to be very clear because there's also the supply chain  
**[0:47:49-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:47:49):**  market risk, like implementing new crops, even, you know, like a new crop for that region  
**[0:47:56-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:47:56):**  or for that farm is super hard to do, but it's impossible to do if we don't solve for  
**[0:48:02-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:02):**  this labor issue.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:04):**  And so why now, mostly from, let's say from an engineering or technology piece, because  
**[0:48:09-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:09):**  the labor issue, it's clear why now, it's only getting worse.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:12):**  We have to fix it preferably yesterday, which we didn't.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:16):**  But why now, let's ask the investor question.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:19):**  Why is this so exciting now?  
**[0:48:22-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:22):**  Not only so relevant, but so exciting now from a building perspective and also from  
**[0:48:25-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:25):**  an investment perspective, maybe not from the VC yet, but, or maybe that will never  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:29):**  come, but from an investor and studio model, why is the time now?  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:34):**  Well, okay, first I'm going to say the VC opportunity is there for some companies, not  
**[0:48:39-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:39):**  all companies.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:40):**  That's how I would view it.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:42):**  And again, it depends on your fund model and how you're thinking about returns.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:45):**  I think you can make it work.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:49):**  The time is now from a technology standpoint, the positive side and the negative side.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:53):**  So positive side, there has been so much progress in automation and robotics.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:48:59):**  Autonomy at this point is, can be delivered functionally as a service.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:49:05):**  It's the bare minimum.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:49:07):**  It's not that expensive to do anymore if you do it intelligently.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:49:11):**  There are lots of off the shelf robots.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:49:12):**  We're starting to see fleet robots start to be functional.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:49:16):**  And so we're starting to see technology proof points.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:49:20):**  And when you look at other industries, there are very expensive versions of the types of  
**[0:49:27-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:49:27):**  technologies we want to see, whether that's end effectors, whether that's vision, et cetera,  
**[0:49:33-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:49:33):**  that can be basically stripped down and re-engineered for agricultural applications.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:49:41):**  So both hardened for outdoor weather applications and made minimalist because we are not dealing  
**[0:49:50-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:49:50):**  with iPhones, we're dealing with blueberries.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:49:57):**  And then on the negative side of that, though, I think that a lot of investors and technologists  
**[0:50:03-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:50:03):**  are seeing that, are seeing that that opportunity is there to apply technology that is relatively  
**[0:50:09-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:50:09):**  mature from a technology risk standpoint to agricultural applications.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:50:16):**  However, I fear that some of those tech, most of those technologists actually have a limited  
**[0:50:23-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:50:23):**  understanding of agricultural systems.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:50:26):**  And so two things, two things that I'm currently worried about probably could generate a longer  
**[0:50:31-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:50:31):**  list here.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:50:34):**  But one, they're going to be disappointed because they're going to invest in things  
**[0:50:38-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:50:38):**  that take too long to deliver returns or never deliver returns because they're not understanding  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:50:45):**  how to sell to their market over the right timeframe.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:50:50):**  And they don't have a realistic exit opportunity.  
**[0:50:53-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:50:53):**  And then secondly, from a more big picture standpoint, when we start to invest in fully  
**[0:51:00-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:00):**  autonomous systems for monoculture cropping systems, it becomes even harder to diversify  
**[0:51:10-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:10):**  those systems.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:11):**  So when you look at all of the strawberry harvesters out there, many of which are super  
**[0:51:16-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:16):**  interesting.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:17):**  It is a very real problem and it needs solving.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:20):**  But they are addressing it.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:22):**  So specifically in the US, you look at like Harvestcrew and you look at Tortuga and I'm  
**[0:51:27-0:51:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:27):**  forgetting one, but I'm sorry to the one I'm forgetting.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:30):**  But like those are all really technically interesting and like relatively feasible things  
**[0:51:34-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:34):**  to do.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:35):**  But what I fear will happen from a, and also agricultural systems are going to be diverse,  
**[0:51:42-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:42):**  we'll have monoculture and that's fine actually is my belief.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:46):**  We need to have some of it, but it locks us in, right?  
**[0:51:50-0:51:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:50):**  So if we're only designing for the really big farms that can afford to customize their  
**[0:51:58-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:51:58):**  farm setup to the very big expensive machine, then we run into this like permanent factory  
**[0:52:06-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:52:06):**  farming system situation.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:52:10):**  And again, like we can have some of that, but we shouldn't have all of that.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:52:15):**  And so that's why now someone better also start pushing the narrative for alternatives  
**[0:52:23-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:52:23):**  to the all in one does everything for your farm type machines.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:52:32):**  But you have to redesign your farm to fit the machine and then you'll be locked in for  
**[0:52:36-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:52:36):**  that for a long time.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:52:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:52:38):**  That's the narrative that is a bit problematic.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:52:40):**  So what would you tell to the invest store side and to, of course, without giving investment  
**[0:52:46-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:52:46):**  advice, but sort of prevent them to get disappointed?  
**[0:52:49-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:52:49):**  Like people are getting very excited about, of course, what technology can do.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:52:53):**  We are amazed every day.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:52:54):**  We're getting very excited about soil and then sort of at that intersection, what would  
**[0:52:58-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:52:58):**  you tell them to be careful with, to look out for, to look into maybe to get excited,  
**[0:53:04-0:53:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:04):**  obviously specialty crops, but beyond that or next set, what would you give them a sort  
**[0:53:09-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:09):**  of general advice?  
**[0:53:11-0:53:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:11):**  Two things.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:13):**  One understand total addressable market and understand that the global, someone's throwing  
**[0:53:20-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:20):**  you a one point four trillion specialty crop market number like that's not your realistic  
**[0:53:28-0:53:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:28):**  addressable market.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:29):**  So really understand the kind of go to market plan and what's realistic on a bottom up basis.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:34):**  And then two and I maybe should have flipped the order of this because I actually think  
**[0:53:37-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:37):**  the second part is more important.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:41):**  Who's using it?  
**[0:53:42-0:53:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:42):**  Who is using the product?  
**[0:53:43-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:43):**  Talk to them.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:44):**  That's like that simple.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:45):**  That's the main one.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:46):**  It's kind of obvious, but I don't think that it's often done as part of a due diligence  
**[0:53:54-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:54):**  process for some reason.  
**[0:53:57-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:57):**  Which isn't generally really weird.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:53:59):**  Like I meet investors that invest in food that they didn't really try.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:54:04):**  The bare minimum you could do is order it.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:54:06):**  Let's see if it gets to your place or wherever you can buy it.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:54:09):**  If it's a direct to consumer and then you get, and if it's technology, you have to figure  
**[0:54:14-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:54:14):**  out who ends up using it and see if they will and if they're happy or not.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:54:20):**  If they are engaged in the collaborative process or not.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:54:25):**  Exactly.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:54:26):**  Well, and this becomes even more challenging, I think, in the robotics because it's increasingly  
**[0:54:32-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:54:32):**  common and this is good to talk to farmers as part of a due diligence process.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:54:37):**  But what's important to understand is that farmers and farm managers are not necessarily  
**[0:54:43-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:54:43):**  the user and they don't necessarily like the people who are their user.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:54:50):**  So that creates a real communications challenge.  
**[0:54:54-0:55:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:54:54):**  And so I think that most people will really struggle to get access to the actual user.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:01):**  So talking about that with the founders and being realistic about how are you trying to  
**[0:55:08-0:55:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:08):**  get access to this group of people matters.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:13):**  Matters absolutely.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:14):**  And then to, because time is flying, but what would you do?  
**[0:55:21-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:21):**  You're running this experiment.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:22):**  Let's say the studio becomes a success and somehow you get access to a significant amount  
**[0:55:28-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:28):**  of resources.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:29):**  I always like to use the one billion question.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:32):**  What would you do with that?  
**[0:55:33-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:33):**  But it doesn't have to be in the studio actually.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:36):**  What if you had a billion dollars to put to work in ag and food?  
**[0:55:39-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:39):**  Let's confine it to North America.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:41):**  And for now, maybe you see great opportunities in Europe.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:43):**  But let's say, how would you put it to work?  
**[0:55:46-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:46):**  What would you prioritize if you had that access for a very long time?  
**[0:55:50-0:55:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:50):**  It doesn't have to be a VC model.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:52):**  Obviously you can also buy land to regenerate if you want to then never sell it.  
**[0:55:55-0:55:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:55):**  And there has to be some kind of return model, but it could be a 50 year plan if you want  
**[0:55:59-0:56:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:55:59):**  to.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:56:00):**  I love this question and I don't know if I'm taking a cop out answer or not.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:56:05):**  But I definitely am wrong about most of my guesses.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:56:09):**  I'm sure I will change in real time.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:56:12):**  Hopefully that's something I try to do forever.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:56:16):**  And there are a ton of really smart people who do not currently and thought smart isn't  
**[0:56:21-0:56:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:56:21):**  even it, but thoughtful and with diverse perspectives who can effectively deploy capital but don't  
**[0:56:27-0:56:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:56:27):**  have access to it.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:56:29):**  And so if I had a billion dollars today, I would want to spend it all ASAP so that it  
**[0:56:35-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:56:35):**  can start to deliver returns.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:56:37):**  And the most effective way to do that, I think, would be to break it down into a bunch of  
**[0:56:42-0:56:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:56:42):**  different experiments run by a bunch of different people.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:56:46):**  And I think the mandate there would be to make things as kind of open sourced as possible  
**[0:56:52-0:56:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:56:52):**  so that we can iterate upon that set of distributed experiments.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:56:58):**  That's what I'm trying to do with Farmhand Ventures.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:57:01):**  We will be as transparent as we can be about our model.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:57:04):**  We'll be able to be more transparent in a little bit.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:57:08):**  But because I want someone to do it better than I'm doing it, actually.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:57:14):**  And beyond collaborative automation and technology, what are other pieces of the puzzle you see  
**[0:57:21-0:57:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:57:21):**  completely or almost completely neglected?  
**[0:57:24-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:57:24):**  Like, where do you get excited where resources are needed but not being deployed at the moment  
**[0:57:31-0:57:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:57:31):**  and where you would be if you had access to a billion dollars?  
**[0:57:34-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:57:34):**  I think one other thing that would be very interesting, I think that there's really a  
**[0:57:39-0:57:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:57:39):**  gap between the real estate real asset investment managers and the tech managers.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:57:45):**  And that needs to be bridged.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:57:49):**  And that some ideally would also be inclusive of the existing land owners.  
**[0:57:54-0:57:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:57:54):**  And I think about this a lot.  
**[0:57:56-0:58:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:57:56):**  I was just with my grandma who we passively manage our farmland and it's fascinating scenario.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:58:04):**  But I would like for those groups to be more interrelated.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:58:08):**  One way I could see one interesting capital structure to do that in my mind would be kind  
**[0:58:15-0:58:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:58:15):**  of like a retrofit farm type fund model.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:58:19):**  So a situation where and these exist for I wish I could remember the name of this fund,  
**[0:58:24-0:58:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:58:24):**  but there's a couple of funds like this that exist for like apartment buildings.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:58:28):**  So where a you basically provide financing such that the landlord can increase insulation,  
**[0:58:36-0:58:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:58:36):**  you know, install new windows, make the apartment more livable and increase rent slightly and  
**[0:58:42-0:58:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:58:42):**  also decrease utility costs substantially.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:58:46):**  And so that's how that fund ends up delivering a return, right?  
**[0:58:50-0:58:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:58:50):**  Usually that's debt based.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:58:52):**  And I think a similar thing could absolutely exist for farmland.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:58:57):**  And that could be tied again to the agriculture technology element of things and the practice  
**[0:59:02-0:59:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:02):**  side of things.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:05):**  I think that could be super duper interesting.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:08):**  And I would love to see if anyone's doing it, reach out, I want to talk to you.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:12):**  And scalable because that's especially when it gets into the debt side of things, the  
**[0:59:18-0:59:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:18):**  debt market is a number of times bigger than a lot of the other markets combined.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:22):**  And there's just so much money looking for these kinds of things going into real estate,  
**[0:59:26-0:59:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:26):**  going into renewable energy, going into other things that would love probably access to  
**[0:59:31-0:59:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:31):**  other real assets like land, not necessarily buying it, but improving it over time and  
**[0:59:35-0:59:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:35):**  getting an okay return out of that is very, very interesting because you're talking about  
**[0:59:40-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:40):**  large quantities of money and large quantities of hectares, which means a lot of impact.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:45):**  And so there we need way more experimentation.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:49):**  Absolutely right.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:50):**  But what if, can I go ahead?  
**[0:59:51-0:59:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:51):**  Well, I guess the one other thing I would add that I'm like, when I look at Europe especially,  
**[0:59:57-1:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=0:59:57):**  it's very interesting to compare, contrast, well, climate smart ag in the US versus, well,  
**[1:00:06-1:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:00:06):**  it depends if you're in the UK or the rest of the EU, but farm to fork strategies in  
**[1:00:11-1:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:00:11):**  the EU.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:00:14):**  One thing I would like to see a lot more investment in as well is really measuring emissions instead  
**[1:00:23-1:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:00:23):**  of modeling emissions on a policy basis because one, I think that if we could get more confidence  
**[1:00:34-1:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:00:34):**  in that number, there might be a little bit less controversy, but more importantly, actually,  
**[1:00:40-1:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:00:40):**  if we could measure that number.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:00:44):**  And so specifically what I mean here, you look at like the Netherlands or you look at  
**[1:00:48-1:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:00:48):**  Ireland in terms of like cattle culling controversies as relates to the 2030 methane reduction pledge.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:00:59):**  Right now we're having to meet, every nation is trying to meet these goals based off of  
**[1:01:06-1:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:01:06):**  models that are extrapolations of studies done in limited geographies with limited genetics,  
**[1:01:15-1:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:01:15):**  with limited feed input types.  
**[1:01:17-1:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:01:17):**  And it's really comparing apples to oranges and then extrapolating off of them.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:01:22):**  And while I wouldn't go, we directly need to lower emissions.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:01:25):**  And so I don't want to go so far as to say, no, no, no, like cows aren't a problem.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:01:31):**  But what I would like to see is a reward for the dairies that are, and the reward actually  
**[1:01:38-1:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:01:38):**  in some cases would be not a punishment, but a reward for-  
**[1:01:42-1:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:01:42):**  Not being closed, yeah.  
**[1:01:43-1:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:01:43):**  Right, not having to cull your cattle, but a reward for adopting a new manure digester  
**[1:01:50-1:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:01:50):**  that reduces your, or a feed additive that reduces your emissions.  
**[1:01:55-1:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:01:55):**  And right now we don't have the infrastructure in place to enable that on a legislative basis.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:02:05):**  So I would love to see more investment on that front.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:02:09):**  But that's a tricky one.  
**[1:02:11-1:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:02:11):**  It's a tricky one because I continue to see these charts of I think our world in data  
**[1:02:17-1:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:02:17):**  and things like that showing the immense emissions from livestock.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:02:24):**  And I think the listener of the show has always replied to that on LinkedIn, constantly taking  
**[1:02:29-1:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:02:29):**  apart the LCA underneath there and the models underneath there, which are let's say imprecise  
**[1:02:34-1:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:02:34):**  by best and probably flawed completely if you look at them.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:02:39):**  It's much more nuanced than that.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:02:41):**  And the issue is that they're being used for all kinds of legislative stuff across the  
**[1:02:46-1:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:02:46):**  EU and across the world, which doesn't really hold any ground.  
**[1:02:51-1:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:02:51):**  The underlying assumptions there are very, very risky.  
**[1:02:54-1:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:02:54):**  Doesn't mean we shouldn't address the methane problem and all that, but it's very tricky  
**[1:02:59-1:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:02:59):**  to do that.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:00):**  And it's very tricky because you're punishing a lot of people that have made massive changes  
**[1:03:03-1:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:03):**  in their practices.  
**[1:03:06-1:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:06):**  And we just throw out the cow with all the issues and not really addressing the underlying  
**[1:03:12-1:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:12):**  issues, which probably the issue because they're all inside and eating corn and soil all day.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:17):**  And there's an underlying issue there that is very tricky.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:21):**  Doesn't mean we don't have to reduce the amount of livestock in the Netherlands, but the underlying  
**[1:03:25-1:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:25):**  questions are not asked and completely being lying on those models except for measuring  
**[1:03:29-1:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:29):**  actually the above fields levels that you mentioned before.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:35):**  That would be super interesting because then you can see actually like, okay, what's the  
**[1:03:38-1:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:38):**  actual emission like and how does it fluctuate over a year and how does it fluctuate over  
**[1:03:43-1:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:43):**  different pastures?  
**[1:03:44-1:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:44):**  How does it fluctuate over X, Y, Z?  
**[1:03:46-1:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:46):**  And we have no idea now.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:48):**  All of this data comes from close environments, which by definition doesn't really represent  
**[1:03:53-1:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:53):**  the outside environment.  
**[1:03:54-1:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:54):**  So we have sort of, maybe some of the methane gets absorbed immediately by bacteria.  
**[1:03:58-1:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:58):**  Have we any clue?  
**[1:03:59-1:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:03:59):**  No, not really because there's no data.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:02):**  Right.  
**[1:04:03-1:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:03):**  Yeah.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:04):**  No, and especially, and like the positive side is that for the regenerative movement,  
**[1:04:09-1:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:09):**  or organic, which may be-  
**[1:04:11-1:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:11):**  Go and invest in that stuff and-  
**[1:04:12-1:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:12):**  You gotta prove it.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:13):**  Prove, prove that you're way like a 3X, 10X, whatever the X is better, or even 10% and  
**[1:04:20-1:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:20):**  show like, look, it's not the same product.  
**[1:04:23-1:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:23):**  It's not the same.  
**[1:04:24-1:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:24):**  Like we're now doing with nutrient density.  
**[1:04:25-1:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:25):**  Like it's not the same.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:27):**  It's not the same tomato.  
**[1:04:28-1:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:28):**  It's not the same piece of beef.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:29):**  It's not like you cannot call it the same because it's often charged different in terms  
**[1:04:33-1:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:33):**  of certain vital nutrients that you need.  
**[1:04:35-1:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:35):**  Maybe it's often charged different in sort of, in a number of emissions, but we don't  
**[1:04:39-1:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:39):**  know because we took one study somewhere and we extrapolated for basically the all of you  
**[1:04:44-1:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:44):**  and then said, no, you have to reduce in this, this and this, which is risky.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:48):**  But yeah, what's the business model of measurements?  
**[1:04:51-1:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:51):**  Very difficult to invest in that and to get that going, but very, very needed.  
**[1:04:56-1:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:56):**  So completely neglected.  
**[1:04:57-1:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:04:57):**  I would keep a piece of that billion to invest in those because potentially it's the highest  
**[1:05:04-1:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:04):**  potential outcome or positive outcome you can get by simply showing what's currently  
**[1:05:09-1:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:09):**  happening.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:10):**  Right.  
**[1:05:11-1:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:11):**  Cause it can drive everything else forward theoretically.  
**[1:05:13-1:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:13):**  But yeah, there's, there's a lot of political complications.  
**[1:05:17-1:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:17):**  Of course, because we're on a certain track.  
**[1:05:19-1:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:19):**  And so what would you change if you had one, if you had a magic wand, you know, this question  
**[1:05:23-1:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:23):**  is coming and you could chase one thing in ag and food.  
**[1:05:27-1:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:27):**  What would that be?  
**[1:05:30-1:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:30):**  I actually think it's that, I mean, yeah, maybe I skipped a step there, but yeah, I,  
**[1:05:34-1:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:34):**  I like to measure everything.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:38):**  I think that being able now, like it's unrealistic, right?  
**[1:05:43-1:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:43):**  Most people don't actually want to get into the weeds of the different numbers and the  
**[1:05:47-1:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:47):**  different kind of optimization models.  
**[1:05:51-1:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:51):**  But I do.  
**[1:05:54-1:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:05:54):**  And if you could do that in an affordable way, I think it can unlock almost everything  
**[1:06:00-1:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:06:00):**  that we've talked about and, and then some kind of, but I don't, I also think that, I  
**[1:06:07-1:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:06:07):**  also don't know that it's feasible, right?  
**[1:06:09-1:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:06:09):**  Like this goes all the way back to with like the Yield Lab Institute work that I've done.  
**[1:06:15-1:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:06:15):**  Like when I, so we at the, so the Yield Lab Institute is the nonprofit branch of the Yield  
**[1:06:22-1:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:06:22):**  Lab family of funds.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:06:25):**  And was initially start, I started it initially cause I wanted to try to quantify impact across  
**[1:06:29-1:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:06:29):**  an early stage venture capital agri-food tech fund portfolio.  
**[1:06:33-1:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:06:33):**  I don't think you can do that actually authentically.  
**[1:06:36-1:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:06:36):**  Like I don't think that's really possible.  
**[1:06:38-1:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:06:38):**  The more you dig into it, the more you try to force quantification on it or the more  
**[1:06:43-1:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:06:43):**  I dug into it and tried to do that, I realized I feel like there's going to be double and  
**[1:06:49-1:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:06:49):**  triple accounting here and it's inauthentic.  
**[1:06:52-1:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:06:52):**  And so it's better just to say, we'll only invest if it has a binary positive or negative  
**[1:06:58-1:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:06:58):**  impact, and we'll just have to leave it at that.  
**[1:07:00-1:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:00):**  And that's going to have to be good enough actually for an impact venture capital fund  
**[1:07:06-1:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:06):**  with some reporting and continuing to monitor that.  
**[1:07:10-1:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:10):**  But yeah, so I say, I wish we could quantify everything with a caveat that I might be wrong,  
**[1:07:16-1:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:16):**  that it's the best thing to do.  
**[1:07:19-1:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:19):**  But would you, would it, or is it possible on a farm level or field level?  
**[1:07:24-1:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:24):**  I imagine like a few layers away.  
**[1:07:27-1:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:27):**  Okay.  
**[1:07:28-1:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:28):**  But to be able to start getting real data from a field, it could be an orchard, it could  
**[1:07:33-1:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:33):**  be whatever table grapes could be.  
**[1:07:37-1:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:37):**  Are we getting any close to getting, I'm not even saying real time, because that would  
**[1:07:42-1:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:42):**  be amazing, but like proper data with an okay sense of accuracy that we can actually compare  
**[1:07:47-1:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:47):**  and start looking at, okay, this is just a better way of doing this, or it's a more positive  
**[1:07:52-1:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:52):**  way because of this, this and this.  
**[1:07:53-1:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:53):**  Do we get anywhere or is that sort of a pi pre?  
**[1:07:58-1:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:07:58):**  Do you mean from like an externality variable?  
**[1:08:01-1:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:08:01):**  Yeah.  
**[1:08:02-1:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:08:02):**  Even just the emission side, like you mentioned, this is possible now.  
**[1:08:05-1:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:08:05):**  Is that how accurate do we get in a sense?  
**[1:08:07-1:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:08:07):**  Can we compare hectares to hectares or is it more of regional?  
**[1:08:11-1:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:08:11):**  Today in Western Europe and most of North America and increasingly Latin America, you  
**[1:08:17-1:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:08:17):**  can measure every roughly five weeks the flux, so the change in atmospheric carbon dioxide.  
**[1:08:27-1:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:08:27):**  And you can do that on a field by field basis.  
**[1:08:30-1:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:08:30):**  That can get better as more satellites get launched.  
**[1:08:34-1:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:08:34):**  I think the other really important thing that we haven't talked about is water.  
**[1:08:37-1:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:08:37):**  I'd argue it might be more important than the CO2 thing actually, and then also nitrous  
**[1:08:41-1:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:08:41):**  oxide.  
**[1:08:44-1:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:08:44):**  And yeah, you cannot, the challenge with the water thing is evapotranspiration stuff is  
**[1:08:53-1:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:08:53):**  only valuable to agronomics if you can get it really more than daily actually.  
**[1:08:58-1:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:08:58):**  You can't do that right now, but I am aware of a couple of companies working on launching  
**[1:09:04-1:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:09:04):**  new satellites to enable that.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:09:06):**  So I think we can get there.  
**[1:09:09-1:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:09:09):**  But again, that runs into the problem of like, but you know what we're measuring?  
**[1:09:13-1:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:09:13):**  We're measuring these like nerdy science concepts actually.  
**[1:09:19-1:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:09:19):**  And again, I suspect what might matter more is the people.  
**[1:09:22-1:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:09:22):**  And so that's where I'm like, the science geek in me wants to do all of that.  
**[1:09:28-1:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:09:28):**  And I wonder if that could have adverse, I'd want to think through the consequences of  
**[1:09:33-1:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:09:33):**  that.  
**[1:09:34-1:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:09:34):**  Although I think we ultimately are moving towards doing that regardless.  
**[1:09:37-1:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:09:37):**  Yeah, no, it's very interesting to think about what that would lead to if we are daily able  
**[1:09:46-1:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:09:46):**  to measure water and emissions, et cetera.  
**[1:09:50-1:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:09:50):**  What would that give us?  
**[1:09:52-1:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:09:52):**  We know a lot more and now what do we do with that?  
**[1:09:55-1:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:09:55):**  And it raises super interesting questions about data ownership, like farm data ownership,  
**[1:10:07-1:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:10:07):**  because yeah, there's been a lot of interesting content on this.  
**[1:10:12-1:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:10:12):**  And I've done a lot of work on this with the Ag Launch Group.  
**[1:10:15-1:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:10:15):**  But like, yeah, it just raises questions when you can suddenly get all the data you need  
**[1:10:23-1:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:10:23):**  just off Google Earth.  
**[1:10:28-1:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:10:28):**  That's part of a whole different podcast.

**[1:11:51-1:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:11:51):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:11:53-1:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:11:53):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question, how to put money  
**[1:11:58-1:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:11:58):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[1:12:02-1:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:12:02):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[1:12:27-1:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:12:27):**  You, the soil builders and investors in the space.  
**[1:12:30-1:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:12:30):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,

**[1:12:45-1:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:12:45):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[1:12:47-1:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:12:47):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[1:12:50-1:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:12:50):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[1:12:55-1:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:12:55):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[1:12:59-1:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:12:59):**  Is this course free?  
**[1:13:00-1:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:00):**  No.  
**[1:13:01-1:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:01):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:04):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[1:13:08-1:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:08):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[1:13:13-1:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:13):**  different means.  
**[1:13:14-1:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:14):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  
**[1:13:19-1:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:19):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:13:21-1:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:21):**  Thank you.  
**[1:13:22-1:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:22):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:13:24-1:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:24):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:13:30-1:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:30):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[1:13:32-1:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:32):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:13:37-1:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:37):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:13:43-1:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:43):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[1:13:47-1:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:47):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:13:49-1:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:49):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:13:54-1:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:54):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:13:58-1:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:13:58):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:14:02):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:14:03-1:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:14:03):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:14:05-1:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:14:05):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:14:08-1:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:14:08):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:14:11-1:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:14:11):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:14:13-1:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:14:13):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:14:19-1:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/connie-bowen#t=1:14:19):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or whatever you're drinking.

### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2021-00-27)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:00:00):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I am super excited to share with you the online video course  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  How to put money to work in regenerating soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while  doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:00:15):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  to work in regenerating soils and have been following this space since 2011 and recording  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:35](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:00:34):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in this space?  What should you read?  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:00:42):**  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:00:52):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management, consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:01:12):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:01:25):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:01:43):**  Thank you.  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to write along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:01:59):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  find if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:02:19):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:02:33):**  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

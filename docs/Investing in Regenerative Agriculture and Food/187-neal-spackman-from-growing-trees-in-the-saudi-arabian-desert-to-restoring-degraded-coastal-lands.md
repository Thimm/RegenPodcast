**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:14):**  The rule in good real estate investments is to buy low when nobody sees value and then  
**[0:00:19-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:19):**  of course create value.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:21):**  Our guest today argues that the opportunity in Regenec lies in buying extremely degraded  
**[0:00:26-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:26):**  coastal lands.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:27):**  In places where there is literally no life, no photosynthesis, no soil, but a lot of waves  
**[0:00:32-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:32):**  with seawater.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:33):**  And using this seawater to raise fish but mostly shrimp and other aquaculture species,  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:39):**  use the wastewater of these shrimps to restore mangroves and grow saltwater species, which  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:43):**  in turn produce most of the feed for the shrimp.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:47):**  Not 100% close look but a lot better than degraded coastlands without any soil.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:52):**  Feasible?  
**[0:00:53-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:53):**  Probably.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:54):**  The forest today has grown many many trees without outside irrigation in the Saudi Arabian  
**[0:00:58-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:58):**  desert.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:59):**  Practical and scalable?  
**[0:01:00-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:00):**  Let's see.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:01):**  Investable?  
**[0:01:02-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:02):**  Let's find out.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:03):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:10):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:14):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:20):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:24):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:27):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:31):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:35):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:39):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:12):**  Today with the founder of Regenerative Resources Co. transforming millions of acres of degraded  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:17):**  landscapes into productive ecologies.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:20):**  Welcome Neil.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:21):**  Thanks Colin, it's great to be here.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:24):**  And to start with a personal question, how did you end up in the soil movement?  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:29):**  Let's call it like that.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:30):**  I mean, many people will know some of your work.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:32):**  I will let you introduce yourself.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:34):**  We'll definitely put a very famous video of you in the links below.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:39):**  But how did you roll into this?  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:42):**  Or how did you end up spending your time focused on soil and mangroves?  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:46):**  You were obviously going to talk about that.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:47):**  Let's say the regeneration movement.  
**[0:02:51-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:51):**  So I got into the regeneration movement largely as a result of travel.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:00):**  I spent a lot of time in Guatemala when I was younger and some time in the Caribbean  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:04):**  as well.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:06):**  And that's where my interest, it kind of came by way of poverty actually.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:12):**  I became very interested in poverty in my early 20s.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:16):**  Sometime in there I made the connection between poverty and land use and got very interested  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:25):**  in sustainable agriculture.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:27):**  You remember when or where?  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:28):**  Was it a click or was it a gradual process?  
**[0:03:31-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:31):**  Oh no, I was living in a little town called Tecolotan, which is in kind of central Guatemala,  
**[0:03:41-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:41):**  now central Guatemala, and meeting with corn farmers who were telling me about how their  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:51):**  corn yield was going down and they were facing drought.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:57):**  And they were debating over if they needed to switch crops or if they needed to buy more  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:04:01):**  inputs.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:04:06):**  And I think these were some of the poorest folks I've ever met, you know, and we helped  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:04:12):**  them dig a well.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:04:15):**  We helped them with a little bit of water access stuff.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:04:18):**  But that would have been 2001, when really maybe 2002.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:04:30):**  And I went back and went to school.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:04:36):**  I came back to the States, I went to school, ended up studying Arabic and economics.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:04:44):**  But the passion for sustainable ag and as well as sustainability in the built environment,  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:04:50):**  they kind of became my hobby.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:04:54):**  I read probably between 2003 and 2008 or so, I kind of read everything I could get my hands  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:05:04):**  on on those subjects, but it wasn't what I was doing professionally.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:05:10):**  And then in 2010, I was offered the chance to join the El Bela project in Saudi Arabia.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:05:25):**  And that was my chance to get into this stuff professionally.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:05:29):**  So at the time, I had very little experience, aside from, you know, voluntary work in Latin  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:05:36):**  America.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:05:39):**  But it was my chance to pivot into the kind of thing I really wanted to do professionally.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:05:43):**  So I started doing this professionally in 2010.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:05:49):**  And that project, I spent eight and a half years, eight, eight and a half years working  
**[0:05:58-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:05:58):**  with tribes of settled nomads in the Saudi desert, prototyping a system to reverse desertification,  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:08):**  restore the indigenous grazing patterns and the indigenous livelihoods, and in a sense,  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:15):**  create rural wealth by reestablishing ecological function.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:20):**  So that project was, it ended up being very heavy on the regenerative and very light on  
**[0:06:26-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:26):**  the agriculture, but it was a regenerative ag aimed at a silvopasture system.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:35):**  And that was a massive adventure.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:40):**  The reason I was hired onto that was more because of my language, culture and leadership  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:46):**  skills more than for my proven record on reversing desertification.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:52):**  Right?  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:53):**  It was that.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:54):**  And not so many people, I think, that have the full package and on the language side  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:58):**  and cultural and the practicalities of that.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:07:03):**  There was a concerted effort to find someone that would be viewed as politically neutral  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:07:08):**  and tribally neutral.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:07:11):**  And I think that's why they picked an American and a Christian was because I would show up  
**[0:07:18-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:07:18):**  generally with, as a total foreigner, and therefore I could establish a guest status.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:07:26):**  And in Arab culture and particularly in Bedouin culture, there are very strict rules about  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:07:32):**  how guests are treated.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:07:35):**  And so that was kind of the social and cultural entry point for that project to happen.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:07:44):**  But we did, you know, we made thousands of mistakes in that project, prototyping different  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:07:50):**  things, doing lots of small trials, and we had a few very big successes.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:07:57):**  And the, I don't want to talk too much about the results of that because they're all still  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:05):**  under NDA, but the project itself was tiny, right?  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:10):**  It was like a hundred acres.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:12):**  But we did have a full watershed.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:14):**  We had the mountains, we had wadis, we had kind of an artificially delineated alluvial  
**[0:08:21-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:21):**  plain, and so it was a fractal of the geography of the entire west coast of the Arabian Peninsula.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:29):**  And that was deliberate.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:30):**  We wanted something small enough so that we could prototype and see some successes, but  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:36):**  that would then lead to greater application.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:41):**  I left Al-Baitha in 2018, determined to not do nonprofit work ever again, unless it was  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:53):**  me funding it, right?  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:54):**  If in the future I'm a philanthropist of some sort and able to fund my own nonprofit stuff,  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:00):**  then I'll do it.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:01):**  What's the main reason?  
**[0:09:02-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:02):**  You sound very convinced.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:03):**  What's the main reason for that?  
**[0:09:06-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:06):**  The, what we built in Al-Baitha was culturally, ecologically sustainable, if not regenerative.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:18):**  But because we were a nonprofit organization and because we were prototyping, the financial  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:25):**  side of things was always a struggle, right?  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:28):**  Which is typical of all nonprofits, right?  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:30):**  You spend a huge amount of energy.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:33):**  On getting the money in and not so much on putting it to work.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:37):**  Well, exactly.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:38):**  And so for, after eight years of running a nonprofit, I said, okay, whatever I do next,  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:45):**  it's got to make money because that's how, that's how the snowball effect happens, right?  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:52):**  If you're making money, then you can go do it again.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:55):**  So where did you go next?  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:56):**  Like what was that with such a strong conviction and very understandable, I think many people  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:00):**  in this podcast would be nodding right now.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:03):**  Like of course.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:04):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:05):**  What's next?  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:06):**  And it's, so I left Al-Baitha.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:07):**  With that experience, I'll put a video below.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:09):**  There's some great, like the difference and the learnings there and just the sheer possibilities  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:15):**  are fascinating, especially visually as well.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:18):**  So after you've done that, on the, let's say the social side and the soil side, regeneration  
**[0:10:24-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:24):**  side, where do you take that experience?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:27):**  So knowing that I knew nothing about starting a business, I went to Stanford for a year  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:34):**  and did what's called the MSX program.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:36):**  It's essentially a one-year MBA at Stanford for people who are mid-career.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:43):**  So I did a year at Stanford where I met my current partners through a sustainability  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:49):**  center there.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:50):**  We actually won a grant from the Tomcat Center for Sustainability, which was kind of the  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:58):**  first revenues we got in regenerative resources.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:01):**  But I went to Stanford and said, okay, I'm going to start this new thing I've never done  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:06):**  before.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:07):**  I know I'm going to make a lot of mistakes.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:09):**  If I go to a business school and at least do some case studies and some learning and  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:13):**  get some tutelage and build a network, then I can avoid mistakes when I try to, whatever  
**[0:11:20-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:20):**  I try to do next, I know it's going to be a for-profit.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:23):**  I know it's going to be entrepreneurship.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:28):**  And so I was at Stanford from 2018 to 2019, and we incorporated regenerative resources  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:37):**  August of 2019.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:40):**  So it was two months after graduation that that happened.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:43):**  And it was very serendipitous because I was still thinking I was going to be doing a somewhat  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:51):**  standard agroforestry business is what I imagined going into Stanford and coming out.  
**[0:11:58-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:58):**  What is to you?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:59):**  Regenerative resources is very different.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:02):**  What is a standard agroforestry business?  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:04):**  What was it back in the day when you entered in your mind?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:06):**  I was thinking primarily about arable land or hyperarid agroforestry because that's what  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:13):**  we did in Elbeida was hyperarid agroforestry.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:17):**  And so there were ideas about taking a real estate angle to that.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:22):**  There are ideas about breeding and patenting some trees that are largely forgotten, but  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:30):**  have been used extensively historically.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:34):**  So what changed in that year?  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:37):**  What made it go, I would say towards the extreme quote unquote side or much more of a generative  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:42):**  side?  
**[0:12:43-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:43):**  So I actually think that's where the biggest opportunity is, is the highly degraded non-arable  
**[0:12:53-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:53):**  landscapes because the barriers to entry are a lot lower and because the potential transformation  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:13:05):**  is a lot higher.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:13:07):**  Like if I go and buy an acre of corn in Iowa for $10,000, it may be somewhat degraded after  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:13:17):**  decades of mono-cropping corn, but it's still got soil.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:13:24):**  It's still understood to be arable and agricultural land.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:13:27):**  It still costs $10,000 an acre to get it.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:13:33):**  As the land we're looking at, some of it we can get for $500 an acre.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:13:40):**  Like in good real estate, the difference is made when you buy it.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:13:44):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:13:45):**  And so the barriers to entry are lower, the potential transformation is a lot higher and  
**[0:13:53-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:13:53):**  it can actually be just as profitable as a field of corn with much lower input costs.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:02):**  And that's the answer to your question of what's something about regenerative agriculture  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:08):**  that most people don't think is true.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:10):**  That is true.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:13):**  We can transform highly degraded land into extremely productive land in a way that doesn't  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:21):**  duplicate the common problems of mono-crop systems.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:27):**  What kind of landscape are we?  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:28):**  You say it's so much more degraded, this is an audio podcast obviously, walk us through  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:33):**  visually, look what kind of...  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:35):**  How should we...  
**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:36):**  Because we can all imagine an acre of corn in Iowa.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:39):**  Most people I think can or you can Google that.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:41):**  What should I imagine the kind of landscapes or lands you are looking at and get excited  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:46):**  about because of the potential?  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:48):**  What do we see there?  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:49):**  What do we feel?  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:50):**  What do we smell?  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:51):**  So let me talk about regenerative resources a little bit to answer that question.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:56):**  We are focused on coastal landscapes and largely barren or degraded coastal landscapes.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:06):**  Generally in the subtropics or the tropics.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:10):**  And what you can...  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:12):**  If you are sitting on one of our sites in a pre-development phase, it's extremely windy,  
**[0:15:19-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:19):**  it's very salty, there is no soil, no water and no photosynthesis.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:27):**  Not a very nice place to be.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:29):**  Hyperarid, well you do have the sound of the waves.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:32):**  Which is nice.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:33):**  Hitting the beach, that's nice.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:35):**  But this is land that nobody sees any value in whatsoever.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:42):**  It is...  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:43):**  And yet you do.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:44):**  Salt pans and...  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:46):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:47):**  Yeah, yeah, that's what we are looking for.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:50):**  And so what we have developed, or rather what my partners have been working on, they have  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:56):**  a 50-year history of developing the system that we are now rolling out.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:02):**  And it's built on the work of a scientist named Carl Hodges, who is a big fish in a  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:10):**  medium-sized pond.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:12):**  A very renowned scientist in his day.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:15):**  He passed away two years ago.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:18):**  But Carl Hodges was the first person to be able to replicate the life cycle of shrimp  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:24):**  in an aquaculture facility.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:26):**  So the entire shrimp aquaculture world starts with him.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:32):**  But he immediately went into trying to make that system circular.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:35):**  So he, in the 1960s, he got a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to catalog halophytic  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:45):**  plants with cropping potential.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:50):**  Halophytes are plants that grow in seawater.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:52):**  And probably the most well-known is mangroves.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:56):**  Mangroves are halophytes, but there are also annual halophytes.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:17:01):**  Probably the most well-known that is edible is salicornia, which is also known as sea  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:17:07):**  beans or samphire or sea asparagus, which grows all over the world.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:17:13):**  But there are hundreds of halophytes with cropping potential, if they are to be developed.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:17:23):**  And so what Carl imagined in a world where you've got freshwater scarcity and soil depletion  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:17:33):**  is, well, the ocean is functionally infinite.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:17:39):**  And if we can grow our food with seawater on degraded coastal land, then we can develop  
**[0:17:45-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:17:45):**  an agriculture that is drought-proof, that never cares about freshwater, and that can  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:17:52):**  use some of the worst land or some of the least biodiverse land on the planet to address  
**[0:17:57-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:17:57):**  issues of food, water security, but also climate and biodiversity and cooling and energy to  
**[0:18:08-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:08):**  some degree as well.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:11):**  And there's a quote I like to use by Denis Bushnell.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:16):**  Denis Bushnell is the longest-serving chief scientist at NASA in the history of—he's  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:22):**  been a chief scientist there for three or four decades.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:26):**  And I'll paraphrase him.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:28):**  But he talks a lot about greening deserts.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:32):**  And when he does, he talks about using saltwater to do it.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:36):**  So his quote is, we're talking about halophytes.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:43):**  If we can green the desert with halophytes, then we can solve food, water, climate, and  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:49):**  energy.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:53):**  And so this is—conceptually, this is an idea that has been studied a great deal.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:58):**  There are a number of academic institutions, international and within the U.S., that are  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:06):**  dedicated to studying halophytic cropping.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:11):**  And my partners were the first to do it commercially.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:15):**  They ran a project—  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:16):**  Yeah, because that's always the question.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:18):**  It's great to be doing this in an academic environment.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:21):**  We know it's possible.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:22):**  But then what holds it back to do it?  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:26):**  Commercially at a certain scale and does certain impact?  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:29):**  Like why don't we see the coastal plains?  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:31):**  What you just described, we have way too much of that, and it's not being grown with halophytes,  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:35):**  basically.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:36):**  So what is or was holding it back?  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:39):**  There's a lot holding it back.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:42):**  Some of it is that the barrier to entry on these kinds of projects is very high.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:47):**  Some of it has to do with the lack of familiarity.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:50):**  In Carl's case, Carl was a brilliant scientist and not a great marketer or a great businessman.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:59):**  And so he was the scientist that developed this.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:01):**  They did develop a commercial scale farm in Eritrea from 1999 to 2004.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:11):**  They have done components of this in Mexico previously in Bahia Aquino and Puerto Pinoasco.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:20):**  But in Eritrea, by year two, they were cash flow positive.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:24):**  They were exporting multiple crops to London and Paris.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:30):**  They had 800 locals employed.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:33):**  They had a War Widows Cooperative providing fodder for the locals' camels off of this  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:40):**  system.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:41):**  That was the first commercial version of this.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:44):**  And that was somewhat modeled on conventional agriculture.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:48):**  They were using mangroves to some degree.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:54):**  One effort to get this done in Egypt was thwarted by the events in 2011.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:00):**  And I met these guys while at Stanford.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:04):**  And so what we are rolling out now is kind of the 2.0 version of what was done at Eritrea.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:10):**  Where you learned at Stanford to talk the tech version.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:14):**  The 2.0.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:16):**  Well, there is technology that we're incorporating now.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:19):**  The language matters as well.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:21):**  But it's also that there's a lot more regenerative ag technique being applied to this system.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:28):**  Whereas, I mean, if you look at the photos of Eritrea, there are large swaths of monocropped  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:33):**  halophytes.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:36):**  And so we're...  
**[0:21:37-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:37):**  Do halophytes as the, let's say, the non-salty water crops thrive in monoculture?  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:45):**  Or is it the same as any, let's say, agriculture system?  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:49):**  No, it has some advantages even there because you don't get weeds when you're irrigating  
**[0:21:55-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:55):**  with seawater, for instance, right?  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:57):**  Because weeds can't grow in it.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:00):**  So there are still advantages if you just compare monocrop to monocrop of halophyte  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:06):**  to typical crops.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:07):**  There are also disadvantages because they're largely undeveloped crops.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:14):**  But so now we are taking agroforestry techniques, incorporating those into halophytic cropping  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:24):**  systems and integrating with aquacultures.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:30):**  And so the system we're doing now that we're going to roll out, we estimate will have significant  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:36):**  comparative advantages to what was done in Eritrea, let alone comparative advantages  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:42):**  to conventional crops that are in markets that we're going to be competing against.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:48):**  What kind of crops are we talking about?  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:50):**  Because you mentioned sea asparagus, but there are hundreds of others.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:54):**  What should we imagine as what kind of food or feed are we talking about?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:00):**  So well, let's talk about aquaculture in a typical onshore aquaculture system.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:09):**  And this is going to be an oversimplification.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:12):**  In a typical onshore aquaculture system, they're dumping their wastewater into the ocean and  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:18):**  creating dead zones with it.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:21):**  That's also their source of water in the aquaculture system.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:26):**  And so they're introducing disease vectors, they're introducing greater risk by using  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:30):**  polluted water as their source, but they're also causing massive environmental problems  
**[0:23:37-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:37):**  and importing all of their feed, and in a typical onshore aquaculture system, feed is  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:44):**  60% of the operating cost.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:48):**  It is easily the largest cost in running a shrimp farm or a salmon farm, right, or what  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:55):**  have you.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:58):**  What we do is we use the wastewater from the aquaculture to grow a mangrove agroforestry,  
**[0:24:06-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:06):**  and then off of that mangrove agroforestry, we have a proprietary feed for the aquaculture.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:14):**  So that creates serious comparative advantages, whether you're talking about resilience, whether  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:21):**  you're talking about risk and disease vectors, whether you're talking about cost of inputs,  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:27):**  right?  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:28):**  Right now, all the aquaculture producers globally are freaking out because the price of wheat  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:32):**  and soybeans are going up, right?  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:36):**  So their feed is getting more expensive, which means their product is getting more expensive  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:40):**  to sell, but supply hasn't gone down so the price isn't changing, right?  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:46):**  A lot of people are getting squeezed right now because their inputs are getting more  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:51):**  expensive, right?  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:52):**  And the reason their inputs are getting more expensive is because of the war in Ukraine,  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:57):**  because fertilizers are so much more expensive, and because of drought, right?  
**[0:25:03-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:03):**  Whether you're talking about China or Southern California or Europe or many, many other places,  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:12):**  we're in the midst of, or rather in the early stages of what could end up being serious  
**[0:25:18-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:18):**  water crisis, and that affects every agricultural industry, including aquaculture.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:25):**  So the fact that our system is circular, where we can produce, we're not at the point that  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:32):**  we can do 100% of our feed.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:35):**  But a good chunk already makes a big difference.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:37):**  And what kind of species are you planning to, are you growing in terms, because that's  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:41):**  always in aquaculture, the big component feed species is fundamental.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:46):**  In Mexico, we're doing shrimp.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:48):**  In Mexico, we're doing shrimp.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:50):**  Probably the Pacific white leg and the blue shrimp.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:53):**  The blue is local.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:56):**  I am not an expert in shrimp aquaculture, but we've got a team member who has 30 years  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:01):**  experience only running shrimp aquaculture.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:07):**  Would you say then the aquaculture piece is sort of the, let's say the engine that then  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:12):**  feeds the mangrove and comes out?  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:14):**  I mean, that's difficult to say, obviously, in a circular system, but that's the starting  
**[0:26:18-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:18):**  point.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:19):**  It is the biological engine for the rest of the whole thing, because that is where our  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:23):**  source of phosphorus and nitrogen comes from, as well as the micronutrients that are in  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:29):**  the ocean water.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:32):**  But it is a seawater agriculture.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:34):**  I need to reemphasize that.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:35):**  We are using no fresh water in our whole system.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:38):**  Yeah, it's good to emphasize that.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:40):**  We do not need it.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:43):**  And that is the revolutionary thing with our system.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:49):**  What scale are we talking about?  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:50):**  What's the minimum size we should envision?  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:55):**  We're not interested in farms smaller than 5000 hectares.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:00):**  We are involved in a project that may go up to 150,000 hectares.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:07):**  But there are at least 15 million hectares globally where our system could be deployed.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:13):**  15, one five.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:16):**  Which is massive.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:19):**  It's small compared to the total amount of arable land under agriculture.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:26):**  But this is not on agriculture now.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:29):**  And it's not on arable land.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:32):**  This is on totally dead land.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:35):**  And so beyond the mangroves, what else?  
**[0:27:39-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:39):**  That kickstarts the system back.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:40):**  Basically, you're producing a big chunk of your feed.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:43):**  And then what else?  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:44):**  Like what kind of, beyond the perennials, what else are you introducing into a system  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:49):**  like that?  
**[0:27:50-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:50):**  It depends on where we are.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:51):**  But for instance, if we were going to do a fodder heavy system, we'd do a lot of atroplex.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:58):**  We'd do a lot of saltbush.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:01):**  We'd do sarcochornia instead of salicornia.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:04):**  But then there's also things like distichlus, which used to be a staple crop in the Colorado  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:10):**  Delta and is largely unknown or forgotten now.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:16):**  But salicornia, distichlus, sea aster, atroplex, saltbush.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:22):**  There are lots of different options.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:25):**  And we don't want to introduce a new species when we're developing a farm.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:29):**  So we tailor the design to local ecosystems as well as to markets.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:37):**  Because what is the market like when you say it's largely forgotten?  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:40):**  You mentioned it a few times on a few discrops.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:42):**  How difficult, what's the market risk?  
**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:45):**  How difficult is it?  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:46):**  I mean, on the shrimp side, I get it.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:48):**  Lower input costs, much better margin.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:50):**  That seems to be quote unquote, like a no brainer.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:52):**  But on the crop side, that might be more challenging.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:56):**  How is that?  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:57):**  No, it's not that the crop is more challenging.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:01):**  It's about what's the right market for it.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:04):**  So for instance, one of the things that we produce is a high quality animal fodder that  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:11):**  is comparable with corn silage.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:15):**  When you look at the protein, when you look at the fiber, when you look at the ash content,  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:23):**  when you look at all that stuff, corn silage is comparable.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:28):**  And so we can go into a country like Egypt, where they're importing 75% of all their fodder  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:38):**  for their dairy and meat industries, and say, hey, Egypt, you've got all this coastline  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:43):**  on the Red Sea that's mostly undeveloped.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:46):**  There is no water there.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:49):**  Why don't we grow one of these systems and we can start reducing your imports of animal  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:53):**  fodder?  
**[0:29:55-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:55):**  We can supply that for your goats, your sheep and your camels and supplement for the cattle.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:30:05):**  And we're not going to use any of your fresh water to do it.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:30:12):**  That is a very compelling pitch.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:30:14):**  Particularly, I mean, Egypt is one of the world's largest importers of wheat.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:30:19):**  So when we're talking about food security, they're very good at aquaculture.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:30:25):**  That's one of the reasons I like Egypt is because they've got the expertise on hand  
**[0:30:31-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:30:31):**  to be able to build one of these systems.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:30:34):**  Very good human resources there.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:30:38):**  But when we're talking about food and water security, animal fodder is a massive both  
**[0:30:44-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:30:44):**  driver of desertification and a massive cause of insecurity in places like the Middle East  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:30:51):**  or India, Pakistan, or even areas of Latin America.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:30:57):**  And so that's a key market that we're going to get into is animal fodder.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:05):**  Aquaculture feed is also a market we're going to be in.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:09):**  We will mostly produce for ourselves on our own farms first while we balance the system  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:14):**  and tweak things.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:16):**  But eventually our feed, right now most feed is one third wheat or one third soy, one third  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:26):**  corn or one third bycatch.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:28):**  It's usually a mix of those four ingredients.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:33):**  If you can imagine shrimp don't eat soybeans in the wild.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:37):**  How weird, they never find a field like that.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:42):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:43):**  There is no corn floating around in the mangroves where shrimp have their nursery.  
**[0:31:52-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:52):**  I can't prove it, but just like cows are supposed to eat grass, shrimp aren't supposed to eat  
**[0:32:01-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:01):**  soybeans and corn and wheat paste.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:03):**  It cannot be good for them.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:08):**  I have faith that our feed will outperform what's conventional right now.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:12):**  I just can't prove it.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:15):**  So what's the current status?  
**[0:32:16-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:16):**  Because I think we as the global, we have talked about coastal agriculture and I wouldn't  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:24):**  say for an extremely long time, but partly maybe yes.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:28):**  How do we get this from a great thing on paper and has been studied a lot in academic research  
**[0:32:34-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:34):**  to actually, because these are not the easiest countries we talk about.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:37):**  These are not the easiest entry markets.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:39):**  These are not the easiest things to do from scratch basically.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:45):**  What is next and how do we pull this literally out of the sand?  
**[0:32:52-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:52):**  It helps that two of my co-founders are the pioneers of this system.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:01):**  And like I said, they have a 40, 50 year history of doing this.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:05):**  Carl Hodge is a scientist I mentioned to you, was our chief science advisor when we incorporated  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:12):**  in 2019.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:14):**  He passed away last year, unfortunately.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:17):**  But in a very real sense, the torch that he lit has been passed on to us.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:24):**  So what's different now if they have been working on that for decades?  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:26):**  I'm just asking the annoying investor question, like why now?  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:30):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:31):**  No, they're great questions.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:33):**  One is the need is not as acute or the need was not as acute as it is now.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:40):**  Two, the development of ecosystem service markets and the recognition of the value of  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:47):**  ecosystem services and in particular carbon.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:53):**  The development of the carbon market, the recognition of policymakers, of the reality  
**[0:33:59-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:59):**  of all the different effects that we, all the stuff we group under the umbrella term  
**[0:34:06-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:06):**  of climate change that is affecting populations and countries.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:13):**  And then the rest of it, I think, is somewhat that someone's got to take the risk to do  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:18):**  it first.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:22):**  That knows what they're doing and actually has the capacity to execute and pull it off.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:28):**  But I think we're the first team with those qualifications.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:32):**  And how difficult is it to talk to?  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:34):**  That's the, sorry, that's not too difficult already there.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:37):**  How has been the response from investors so far?  
**[0:34:41-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:41):**  So we, the most traction we're getting, we got an angel investment in 2019 and we've  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:50):**  been in really kind of incubation mode ever since.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:54):**  We are just coming out of it.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:56):**  So our first project, we are now starting the process to finance it.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:03):**  It's an 8,000 hectare project and it's taken us this long to negotiate the rights.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:13):**  So we started scouting sites.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:17):**  We started putting together a team.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:19):**  We started developing political capital three years ago.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:23):**  And if you can imagine, mangroves are a protected species almost everywhere because we've lost  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:30):**  half of the world's mangroves in the last generation.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:34):**  And if you can imagine going and talking to an environmental ministry person and saying,  
**[0:35:38-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:38):**  hey, we're going to farm mangroves.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:41):**  It's quite a difficult conversation to have.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:44):**  When we started out, the environmental ministry didn't even want to talk with us.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:50):**  They didn't even want to have a conversation.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:55):**  Where are we talking or is that?  
**[0:35:58-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:58):**  That's Mexico.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:59):**  Right.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:00):**  Because they want to protect the mangroves as they should.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:03):**  We had to get some help to get those first meetings set up.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:09):**  Luckily, by then we had some political capital locally from Baja California, which is where  
**[0:36:18-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:18):**  our project is.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:19):**  And after, at this point, we have a written letter of support from the environmental ministry  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:26):**  in Mexico saying we approve the development of the first seawater farm that regenerative  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:31):**  resources is going to do.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:34):**  We will study it.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:35):**  And if it works out, we want to assist in deploying it throughout the rest of the country.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:41):**  So it went from we don't even want to talk to you to, all right, if it works, we want  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:47):**  to do it everywhere that we can do it.  
**[0:36:51-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:51):**  But that takes a lot of patience and a lot of know-how and a lot of support.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:37:00):**  And that transformation, that shift is largely due to one of my co-founders who is a former  
**[0:37:08-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:37:08):**  Swiss diplomat who fell in love with a Mexican lady 20 years and decided to move to Tijuana.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:37:16):**  She's phenomenal and has been the one largely navigating those waters.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:37:25):**  So at this point, we have a number of sites selected.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:37:30):**  We picked one as the one we wanted to do first.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:37:33):**  We have negotiated the right to purchase the first 2,000 hectares or so, slightly less  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:37:39):**  than 2,000.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:37:41):**  Then negotiations to purchase the other 6,000.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:37:46):**  We have the promise that our permits will be expedited.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:37:50):**  We have a local team with tremendous expertise.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:37:56):**  And this is actually a case where we benefited from COVID because most of our team were working  
**[0:38:02-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:38:02):**  in Southeast Asia or Ecuador in various aspects of the aquaculture industry.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:38:08):**  And because of COVID, they got sent home to Mexico.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:38:13):**  And if they can work at home, they want to work at home.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:38:17):**  So we have snatched these guys up and they're phenomenal.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:38:25):**  So we have a team, we have a land, we have a business model, we have the promise of permits,  
**[0:38:31-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:38:31):**  all of which is necessary before you can go to a development bank or investors and say,  
**[0:38:38-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:38:38):**  okay, we're ready for this.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:38:40):**  And that's very, very hard to do that.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:38:47):**  It would have been impossible for us to do it without our angel investor back in 2019,  
**[0:38:52-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:38:52):**  who I think they saw the potential, they were willing to take the risk and be first in.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:01):**  But without it, it would have been absolutely impossible.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:04):**  Without them, it, we, because it is a three to five year process to get a decent sized  
**[0:39:12-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:12):**  project going like this.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:14):**  Now once you've got a first one up and running, expansion by comparison is very simple, right?  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:20):**  You've already got the team, you've got recurring revenues from the project, you've got the  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:25):**  proof of concept sitting there, and you've got a lot more resources.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:31):**  So expansion within country is, we expect will happen comparatively rapidly.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:39):**  Going to a new country, we expect will take another three, three, four years before you  
**[0:39:45-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:45):**  get the first project up and going.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:47):**  But then expansion within country happens through that subsidiary and through local  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:52):**  leadership once everything's up and running.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:54):**  So it's, that's not an uncommon timeline for blue carbon projects, right?  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:01):**  Most blue carbon projects take three to five years to set up, which is why there is so  
**[0:40:06-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:06):**  little supply of blue carbon in the world, because it's extremely difficult to get it  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:12):**  to a point that it's de-risked enough for an investor to actually feel confident going  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:17):**  in.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:18):**  Because how important is that carbon piece for the business model compared to the stream  
**[0:40:23-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:23):**  side and that sort of thing?  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:25):**  For our business model, it's a cherry on top.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:28):**  We don't need it.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:30):**  It's just a positive externality of our system that we can monetize.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:37):**  The way we are deploying it though, and this gets into a really critical piece of the carbon  
**[0:40:45-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:45):**  world, if we're going to get into this subject.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:48):**  When we're talking about high quality carbon credits, right now you're talking about additionality  
**[0:40:53-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:53):**  and permanence and leakage are kind of the three main considerations.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:58):**  And there's a lot of skepticism in the nature-based world about the permanence of forest credits,  
**[0:41:05-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:05):**  right?  
**[0:41:06-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:06):**  Because, well, what's going to stop people from cutting down your forest in 30 years,  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:12):**  right?  
**[0:41:13-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:13):**  And so one of our maxims is it doesn't make any sense to grow trees unless you address  
**[0:41:20-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:20):**  why people are cutting down trees in the first place.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:24):**  And this is not, I think this is tacitly understood by a lot of people, but largely undeveloped  
**[0:41:34-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:34):**  or unaddressed in I would say the majority of carbon projects where permanence in a forestry  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:43):**  project comes from sustainable economies.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:48):**  Because otherwise it gets cut down.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:51):**  That's why we lost the mangroves.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:53):**  That's why we lost the mangroves in the first place is in Southeast Asia mangroves are largely  
**[0:41:58-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:58):**  lost because people are shrimp farmers or they set up aquaculture farms, right?  
**[0:42:05-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:42:05):**  But in Latin America and South America and West Africa, it's deforestation for charcoal  
**[0:42:16-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:42:16):**  or to clear it and start doing agriculture or to build fish traps in the case in Ghana.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:42:24):**  People are cutting down mangroves because they want to make a living, right?  
**[0:42:29-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:42:29):**  And so unless you provide an alternate living, people are going to keep cutting them down.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:42:35):**  And that's what our seawater system builds, right?  
**[0:42:41-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:42:41):**  And the name for this is regenerative seawater agriculture or RSA.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:42:46):**  That's what we call it now.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:42:48):**  In Carl Hodges' time, they called it ISIS, integrated seawater agriculture systems.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:42:56):**  Somehow the name ISIS just doesn't have the same kind of cache or positive connotation  
**[0:43:02-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:02):**  it used to.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:03):**  So we now call it RSA or regenerative seawater agriculture.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:09):**  But what regenerative seawater agriculture does is it builds a circular regenerative  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:14):**  economy in these coastal areas.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:19):**  So let me tell you one, there's a project we're working on in partnership with a few,  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:25):**  with a handful of fishing villages in Mexico.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:30):**  And their catch has decreased by 90% in the last decade, right?  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:35):**  So where they're used to catching 100 fish, they're now catching 10.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:39):**  And they are facing total collapse of their communities.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:45):**  And this is a pattern happening everywhere.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:48):**  Coastal fisheries are being degraded globally.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:52):**  This is not something specific to Mexico.  
**[0:43:54-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:54):**  I have been either tangentially involved in or consulted with or been informed of other  
**[0:44:03-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:03):**  similar projects in Senegal, Ghana, Gambia, Ecuador, Mozambique, Oman, where it's the  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:15):**  same, it may not be 90%, it might be a 50% drop in the last decade.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:20):**  But still destructive.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:22):**  It's massive.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:23):**  It is a massive, massive driver of degradation.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:26):**  Because what happens when you can't, you're a fisherman, your dad was a fisherman, your  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:31):**  grandpa was a fisherman, and you can't catch fish anymore, what are you going to do?  
**[0:44:37-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:37):**  You're either going to poach illegal species, right?  
**[0:44:40-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:40):**  I have talked with families that are hunting sea turtles, because a sea turtle will feed  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:46):**  your family for a week, and they feel tremendously guilty about it.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:51):**  They don't want to do it, but that's how they're feeding their family.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:55):**  You poach illegal species, or you start cutting the mangroves down.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:02):**  So this poverty degradation trap, people are like, okay, short-term needs trump long-term  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:10):**  sustainability, I'm going to cut down these trees even though I know it hurts me in the  
**[0:45:15-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:15):**  long run, because that's the only option I've got.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:18):**  That poverty degradation cycle needs economic development to interrupt it.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:24):**  And that's what our RSA does.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:27):**  So with this group of fishing villages, we have a 30-year vision that we have developed  
**[0:45:34-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:34):**  together.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:36):**  And we are doing a strict mangrove restoration project with them at their request.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:42):**  And that's just a straight blue carbon project, mangrove restoration.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:49):**  And so how do you work with those villages in Mexico?  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:52):**  How are they part of it?  
**[0:45:54-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:54):**  Well, we were invited to go meet with these folks by one of the villagers three years  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:02):**  ago.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:04):**  And that began our engagement with them.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:09):**  Over time, we have developed very good relationships with...  
**[0:46:16-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:16):**  There are more fishing villages in the area.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:20):**  There are three that are working with us quite closely.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:26):**  And the long-term vision is we build an RSA on their land, and that creates jobs for the  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:34):**  fishermen so that the fishermen can put the fishery in rest.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:38):**  Essentially, it allows them to stop fishing for three to five years, let the fishery rehabilitate,  
**[0:46:44-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:44):**  and then begin to fish again, but manage that fishery as a commons under sustainable management  
**[0:46:51-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:51):**  techniques.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:52):**  So in the end, we really envisioned three or four projects with these fishing villages,  
**[0:46:57-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:57):**  one of which is...  
**[0:46:58-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:58):**  Or two of which are mangrove restoration and seagrass restoration, the mangrove restoration  
**[0:47:04-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:04):**  we're already engaged in.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:06):**  The third would be developing an RSA farm big enough to hire all the fishermen and create  
**[0:47:11-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:11):**  that local economy.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:13):**  And then after that, put the fishery into rest for a number of years.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:18):**  And then we would not be part of this next part, but it allows them to work with the  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:23):**  government to set up either a cooperative or some kind of organization that allows them  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:28):**  to manage that fishery sustainably as a commons.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:34):**  That's like the 30-year vision with these fishing villages that we have engaged with.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:40):**  The mangrove restoration project is the first one because it's actually easier to do than  
**[0:47:46-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:46):**  setting up an RSA in this particular area.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:50):**  But that's how we see RSA being deployed in these kinds of circumstances, is this is the  
**[0:47:58-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:58):**  economic system that intercepts and interrupts that poverty degradation trap.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:04):**  And how, like the blue carbon piece, we hear a lot about it.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:09):**  I don't think we see too much.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:12):**  How tricky is the market or how easy is the market?  
**[0:48:16-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:16):**  You say there's not a lot of supply.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:18):**  How do you envision selling that part, even though it's, quote unquote, just a cherry?  
**[0:48:24-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:24):**  But how difficult is that going to be or how easy will that be?  
**[0:48:28-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:28):**  It's going to be super easy because we are where the bottleneck is.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:34):**  It'll be easy to sell.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:36):**  Selling it will be a little bit tricky.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:39):**  That's why supply is where the bottleneck is, is because it's very tricky to develop.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:45):**  In the RSA system, it's just a matter of building the system and doing the science so we can  
**[0:48:51-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:51):**  get good estimates on the carbon.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:52):**  We know it's going to sequester carbon.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:56):**  We don't know how much, particularly when it's net of all the infrastructure that goes  
**[0:49:01-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:01):**  in.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:02):**  But that informs a lot of our decisions.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:05):**  So we could go on the grid for all the power and pumping of that system.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:11):**  But right now, the grid is basically diesel.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:14):**  And so we're going to set up our own solar system.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:19):**  In the future, there's potential for wave energy as well on these systems.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:23):**  But on our first project, it's going to be solar, which brings our carbon expenditures  
**[0:49:28-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:28):**  way down.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:31):**  The kinds of buildings we do will largely be low carbon footprint buildings.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:38):**  So it's not just going to be cement structures with lots of corrugated steel.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:43):**  So the desire to be able to market our blue carbon comes net of the entire development.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:51):**  So that informs our decision making around that.  
**[0:49:54-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:54):**  But then we know that mangroves sequester carbon more efficiently than any terrestrial  
**[0:50:01-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:01):**  ecosystem.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:03):**  And we did do, or not we because I was not there, but my team did do initial studies  
**[0:50:08-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:08):**  of this in Eritrea that gives us some baseline numbers and also informs, in some cases, how  
**[0:50:15-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:15):**  our system will be different than what Eritrea was.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:19):**  But the science will be a little bit expensive, right, because somewhere between 70 and 90  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:29):**  percent of the carbon in our system will be soils rather than in biomass.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:34):**  There's all sorts of shops popping up where they're like, we're going to use satellites  
**[0:50:37-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:37):**  to measure your carbon.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:38):**  And I'm like, well, that's great for the biomass, but it tells us nothing about the soil.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:43):**  And that's where 70 to 90 percent of the carbon is.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:48):**  There are, oh my goodness, there are dozens of new entities popping up where they're like,  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:54):**  we're going to verify your carbon with satellite data and then we're going to put it on chain  
**[0:50:58-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:58):**  and we'll Web3 everything and refi your carbon.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:05):**  It doesn't address the issue, right?  
**[0:51:08-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:08):**  The real issue is how do you inexpensively measure soil carbon?  
**[0:51:15-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:15):**  We're just going to do it expensively at first and then that at least gives us a baseline  
**[0:51:20-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:20):**  estimate for expansion within that region.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:22):**  Of course, the levels are going to be extremely low to begin with.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:26):**  If you look at the land you're purchasing.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:31):**  The baseline is zero.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:35):**  The baseline is easy to establish.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:37):**  It's zero.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:38):**  There is no carbon in these soils.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:41):**  It is salt and dust.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:43):**  It's basically no soil.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:46):**  There's no soil at all because there's no photosynthesis.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:53):**  So yeah, the baseline is easy.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:56):**  There are a number of shops that we like that we are collaborating with in that world, some  
**[0:52:00-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:52:00):**  of which are Web3 oriented that seem to be ahead of the pack on that.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:52:07):**  But for us in the RSA at least, our financial model is built basically without soil estimates  
**[0:52:16-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:52:16):**  incorporated because we don't know what it's going to be, right?  
**[0:52:21-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:52:21):**  It's looking good because that, I mean, we've watched prices quadruple in the last three  
**[0:52:26-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:52:26):**  years.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:52:28):**  Blue carbon was $8 to $10 in 2019.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:52:33):**  It's now above $50.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:52:37):**  High quality blue carbon, it's over $50 a ton right now.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:52:42):**  So I mean, that bodes well for us because not only are we producing blue carbon in the  
**[0:52:49-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:52:49):**  RSA, but RSA in my opinion is the linchpin to successful blue carbon projects globally  
**[0:53:01-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:01):**  because if you don't build an alternate economy, you're not going to have permanence, right?  
**[0:53:05-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:05):**  So our blue carbon will be higher quality than standard stuff because we can address  
**[0:53:10-0:53:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:10):**  that permanence question a lot better than just a standard reforestation or restoration  
**[0:53:16-0:53:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:16):**  project.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:19):**  And that is one of the big questions.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:21):**  How do you guarantee that people aren't just going to come cut it down later when the checkbook  
**[0:53:27-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:27):**  is tight and people can't tighten their belts anymore?  
**[0:53:31-0:53:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:31):**  That's what they go and do.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:33):**  So what our system does is that it helps people that would otherwise be degrading that ecosystem.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:41):**  It helps them become stewards because the ecosystem services of a mangrove forest are  
**[0:53:48-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:48):**  so much higher than anything you could get out of cutting it down and selling it.  
**[0:53:53-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:53):**  If you look at the holistic value, just the services provided to the health of a fishery  
**[0:54:00-0:54:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:00):**  and the quantity of fish that grow in a healthy fishery next to a mangrove forest versus an  
**[0:54:07-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:07):**  unhealthy nursery or an unhealthy fishery next to a degraded mangrove forest, the difference  
**[0:54:13-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:13):**  is astounding, right?  
**[0:54:16-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:16):**  But if you degrade the fishery, that's not helping you anymore and then you degrade the  
**[0:54:20-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:20):**  mangrove forest and then you have total collapse of your community.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:24):**  So this is how you reverse that cycle and help people become stewards of those landscapes  
**[0:54:29-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:29):**  rather than the major cause of degradation.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:32):**  And what have you looked at?  
**[0:54:35-0:54:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:35):**  The scale you're operating in is the conversation around, let's say, stabilizing local climates  
**[0:54:44-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:44):**  or what's the effect of the mangroves on the local, the full ecosystem?  
**[0:54:49-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:49):**  You mentioned this, I see you start laughing.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:51):**  You cannot see that on the audio, but you mentioned that in the project in Saudi Arabia,  
**[0:54:55-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:55):**  this was a fractal of the full landscape or a full watershed.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:59):**  How is that thinking now and how has it been used or is it being used in these kinds of  
**[0:55:05-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:05):**  projects?  
**[0:55:06-0:55:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:06):**  Because we talk a lot about carbon, but it seems like the water cycle is more interesting  
**[0:55:13-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:13):**  than carbon.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:14):**  Maybe not to find out.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:15):**  The water cycle is super interesting and I wish I could share with you who we're working  
**[0:55:19-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:19):**  with to measure that stuff, but I can't.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:22):**  Then we'll talk about it at another time.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:26):**  Well as soon as I can publicly say it, we'll do a press release because it's really exciting.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:31):**  But the greater effect of this is that, so we talked about fishery health, we talked  
**[0:55:41-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:41):**  about carbon.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:42):**  Beyond that, there's biodiversity, water, cooling, sea level rise, and storm protection.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:49):**  So where in places like the Caribbean or Mexico where you do get hurricanes, mangroves are  
**[0:55:55-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:55):**  the greatest protection against hurricanes and our system will duplicate that ecosystem  
**[0:56:01-0:56:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:01):**  service.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:02):**  So for instance, if you're ever boating on the ocean and a big storm is coming in, you're  
**[0:56:06-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:06):**  supposed to park in the mangroves.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:08):**  That is the safest place to go.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:12):**  So storm surges, hurricanes, that is an ecosystem service.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:19):**  I'm not sure we have a way to monetize that right now.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:22):**  If there is a way to monetize it, it would be with the reinsurance companies.  
**[0:56:28-0:56:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:28):**  But then that's also very location specific.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:31):**  And the locations we're looking for tend to be rural.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:37):**  We're not doing this next to a city like Miami.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:40):**  Miami doesn't have thousands of acres of degraded barren land next to it.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:46):**  And if they did, they'd want to build more Miami, not build a farm on it.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:50):**  So there's a mismatch there to some degree.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:56):**  On the water cycle, we know our system will increase freshwater resources, both in terms  
**[0:57:03-0:57:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:03):**  of rainfall creation and in terms of intercepting flash floods and restoring shallow aquifers.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:10):**  We don't know how much yet.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:12):**  And that is something that we have a set of collaborations that we're going to put into  
**[0:57:18-0:57:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:18):**  practice to measure that on our first farm.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:22):**  So in Eritrea, the project in Eritrea cooled the local climate by two degrees Celsius.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:30):**  Wow.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:31):**  And how far did that get?  
**[0:57:34-0:57:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:34):**  Local as in right above or right around?  
**[0:57:37-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:37):**  Only in the immediate vicinity.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:39):**  But still?  
**[0:57:40-0:57:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:40):**  That's massive.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:41):**  But that was only a thousand hectare project.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:45):**  As you expand and grow to scale, the question is how many microclimates do you need to affect  
**[0:57:55-0:57:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:55):**  or create before you start changing climate?  
**[0:57:58-0:57:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:58):**  And I don't know the answer to that.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:59):**  Where is the microclimate?  
**[0:58:00-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:00):**  Nobody knows, but it's a very valid question.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:04):**  We are going to answer that question as part of the R&D around our first farm.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:08):**  And we have some really exciting collaborations built around that.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:11):**  Are exciting compared to forests?  
**[0:58:15-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:15):**  What's the effect of mangroves?  
**[0:58:17-0:58:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:17):**  Of course, because they are at the ocean of all the flooding and the storms, et cetera,  
**[0:58:21-0:58:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:21):**  but in general, affecting the water cycle with their feet in the water.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:26):**  I mean, they did a lot.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:29):**  It is the edge, the first edge within, if you're looking at a closed loop water cycle,  
**[0:58:35-0:58:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:35):**  it's one of the edges where you can make the biggest impact.  
**[0:58:38-0:58:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:38):**  But so you've got the cooling, you've got the increase in water vapor from the evapotranspiration,  
**[0:58:52-0:58:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:52):**  and you have an increase in ice nuclei, right, also from the evapotranspiration, right?  
**[0:58:58-0:59:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:58):**  Every tree does this, but they give off a part of their respiration, they give off volatile  
**[0:59:03-0:59:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:03):**  organic compounds that in the atmosphere will break down into ice nuclei, and then they  
**[0:59:08-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:08):**  assist with cloud creation, right?  
**[0:59:11-0:59:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:11):**  So that's the rainfall side of things.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:14):**  That's not necessarily an effect that will be felt locally or even regionally, right?  
**[0:59:19-0:59:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:19):**  So mapping out the precipitation shed of a given project is, I don't know that we're  
**[0:59:25-0:59:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:25):**  going to do that because it would be neat to know, but it doesn't necessarily move the  
**[0:59:33-0:59:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:33):**  bottom line and it doesn't, if there's some PhD out there and you want to do like a post-doc.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:37):**  Somebody wants to pay for the rain.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:39):**  If somebody wants to do that study, you are welcome to come and stay on our farm and measure  
**[0:59:45-0:59:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:45):**  it, but that's not something we're going to pay for.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:47):**  Do you envision like a situation at some point where this is, like in certain projects maybe  
**[0:59:52-0:59:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:52):**  where it's relatively easy quote unquote to measure and you know, okay, if we restore  
**[0:59:58-1:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:58):**  X amount of hectares here, we know we influence precipitation like X kilometers or miles,  
**[1:00:05-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:05):**  like could be quite far away because some of these systems are there of course not linear,  
**[1:00:09-1:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:09):**  but there could be interesting parties down the line that said, we would love for more  
**[1:00:15-1:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:15):**  of this to happen because we need, why is that too complex?  
**[1:00:20-1:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:20):**  It's not too complex.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:23):**  There are shops out there who do that kind of modeling.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:30):**  I don't know that that would be compelling enough to say, could you get Panama to pay  
**[1:00:39-1:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:39):**  for that in El Salvador?  
**[1:00:40-1:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:40):**  I don't think so.  
**[1:00:42-1:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:42):**  For sure with blockchain you can.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:45):**  Could you get Arizona to pay for that in Baja, California?  
**[1:00:51-1:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:51):**  I doubt it.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:52):**  Not at this point.  
**[1:00:54-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:54):**  Maybe if we had better modeling and proven the whole thing out, then maybe the reinsurance  
**[1:01:00-1:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:00):**  people do, but I don't think it's necessary.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:04):**  I'm happy to provide.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:09):**  This is one of the challenging things is we're trying to privately finance something that  
**[1:01:14-1:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:14):**  creates a great deal of public good.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:18):**  It's the opposite of privatizing gains and making the losses public, which is what the  
**[1:01:25-1:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:25):**  banks did in 2008.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:27):**  They privatized the gain, but make the public pay for it.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:30):**  This is the opposite.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:31):**  We are trying to privatize gains.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:32):**  Which is not a good investment.  
**[1:01:33-1:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:33):**  I mean, it is if you create a lot of public good and a lot of good in general.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:39):**  Is there a way to get private finance for a public good?  
**[1:01:46-1:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:46):**  It's very tricky.  
**[1:01:48-1:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:48):**  But that those positive externalities will inform our marketing.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:57):**  When we go retail to sell our goods, I'm going to be able to say, hey, you can buy shrimp  
**[1:02:04-1:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:04):**  that destroys the ocean or you can buy shrimp that grows a mangrove forest.  
**[1:02:08-1:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:08):**  Which would you rather eat?  
**[1:02:12-1:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:12):**  You know, I'll be able to say that in our marketing and we'll have the science and the  
**[1:02:17-1:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:17):**  proof to back it up.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:19):**  But some of these externalities that are positive, we're just not going to be able to monetize  
**[1:02:23-1:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:23):**  those in the near future.  
**[1:02:26-1:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:26):**  In the distant future, maybe.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:30):**  I'm okay with that because it's awesome.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:34):**  You know, it's awesome.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:38):**  To be able in the future to say, hey, Mr. Cork Farmer further up the watershed, we're  
**[1:02:44-1:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:44):**  giving you this rain.  
**[1:02:49-1:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:49):**  Just to be able to say that we're making it rain and to have the science to back it up.  
**[1:02:53-1:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:53):**  Who else can do that?  
**[1:02:54-1:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:54):**  That's awesome.  
**[1:02:55-1:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:55):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:56-1:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:56):**  And probably you can.  
**[1:02:57-1:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:57):**  I mean, you can model it and probably you can track it even and somehow link it back  
**[1:03:04-1:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:04):**  to your mangrove forest where the evaporation started.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:07):**  That shouldn't be too...  
**[1:03:08-1:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:08):**  I'm completely out of line here, but it shouldn't be too difficult for sure at least.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:12):**  But that would be just being able to say we made it rain in this watershed.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:16):**  Not too much, not too little, but enough to make a proper rain.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:21):**  That's on the rainfall side of things.  
**[1:03:23-1:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:23):**  The other thing is that because we're in deserts, we're also dealing with flash floods.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:31):**  When it does rain, you tend to get flash floods.  
**[1:03:33-1:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:33):**  And our system, instead of letting those flash floods run into the ocean, our system intercepts  
**[1:03:39-1:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:39):**  those.  
**[1:03:40-1:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:40):**  That's part of the design process and part of where the Albeta project bleeds into our  
**[1:03:46-1:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:46):**  work.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:47):**  But by intercepting that and having...  
**[1:03:50-1:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:50):**  You have a kind of a sea water layer underneath our soil.  
**[1:03:54-1:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:54):**  And then what it will do is it will create a freshwater lens where the freshwater will  
**[1:03:58-1:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:58):**  float on top of the sea water.  
**[1:04:00-1:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:00):**  And then further up in the watershed, it will start to restore shallow aquifers.  
**[1:04:07-1:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:07):**  So we will increase groundwater by intercepting that surface flow in addition to increasing  
**[1:04:13-1:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:13):**  rainfall once we're at scale.  
**[1:04:15-1:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:15):**  So that's super cool.  
**[1:04:18-1:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:18):**  I don't know that we can monetize that.  
**[1:04:21-1:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:21):**  We don't really need to at this point.  
**[1:04:23-1:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:23):**  If there's an opportunity in the future, great.  
**[1:04:28-1:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:28):**  And so, I mean, we could talk about this for hours, but I want to be conscious of your  
**[1:04:31-1:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:31):**  time and ask a few questions because I know you have to go at some point for an investor  
**[1:04:35-1:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:35):**  meeting.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:36):**  But what would you tell...  
**[1:04:37-1:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:37):**  I mean, it sounds like we're in the project developer phase, which sort of reminds me  
**[1:04:41-1:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:41):**  of the renewable energy sector a number of years ago.  
**[1:04:46-1:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:46):**  It depends where you are, which renewable...  
**[1:04:47-1:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:47):**  But you have these shops like yourself that are privately funded in this case through  
**[1:04:51-1:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:51):**  a family office, through an angel investor, sorry.  
**[1:04:54-1:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:54):**  And they are developing projects which obviously need other finance.  
**[1:04:58-1:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:58):**  What would you tell investors now?  
**[1:05:00-1:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:00):**  What is their role now?  
**[1:05:01-1:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:01):**  If they get excited about blue carbon mangroves, restoration, rainfall, the whole shebang,  
**[1:05:06-1:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:06):**  what is their role?  
**[1:05:07-1:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:07):**  What should their role be?  
**[1:05:08-1:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:08):**  Obviously, without giving investment advice, but what would you tell them as their role,  
**[1:05:12-1:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:12):**  what they should take as their role to kickstart the system, this whole regeneration system?  
**[1:05:17-1:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:17):**  I mean, this is the role that I'm playing right now.  
**[1:05:21-1:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:21):**  This is the phase that we are in.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:22):**  We are actively financing our first pipeline of projects.  
**[1:05:28-1:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:28):**  And we're also doing an equity raise into RRC, the US entity.  
**[1:05:34-1:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:34):**  And first off, we are not talking a lot with VC.  
**[1:05:39-1:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:39):**  VC in general is a bad fit for this, in my opinion, because of the timeline and because  
**[1:05:47-1:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:47):**  of considerations about being partnered with local entities, our exit is going to look  
**[1:05:51-1:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:51):**  different for our investors.  
**[1:05:55-1:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:55):**  How come?  
**[1:05:56-1:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:56):**  What could be like an exit from the Mexican project or from a project?  
**[1:06:01-1:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:01):**  How do you envision that?  
**[1:06:03-1:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:03):**  We envision that the first money in, essentially, we're selling equity into the first project,  
**[1:06:12-1:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:12):**  where people get a percentage of the cash flow.  
**[1:06:15-1:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:15):**  The change in land value also underpins the value of their share in that SPV.  
**[1:06:21-1:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:21):**  But then when they want to exit, we're going to buy it.  
**[1:06:24-1:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:24):**  We're not going to IPO.  
**[1:06:27-1:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:27):**  We're going to buy it back.  
**[1:06:29-1:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:29):**  That's what we want to do.  
**[1:06:30-1:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:30):**  Just to make sure that the land never gets speculated or what's the reason behind it?  
**[1:06:34-1:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:34):**  Or because you think it's such a good investment?  
**[1:06:37-1:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:37):**  Both.  
**[1:06:38-1:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:38):**  Both.  
**[1:06:39-1:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:39):**  We're the right people to manage it in partnership with our local partners.  
**[1:06:44-1:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:44):**  Yeah, because you don't want at some point to cut down a gigantic hotel.  
**[1:06:51-1:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:51):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[1:06:56-1:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:56):**  How do you do that?  
**[1:06:57-1:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:57):**  That's also part of what informs the exit.  
**[1:06:58-1:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:58):**  How do you make sure that doesn't happen, that somebody comes with a billion dollars  
**[1:07:02-1:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:02):**  and says, let's develop this coast into the next Miami?  
**[1:07:06-1:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:06):**  Just a random example.  
**[1:07:09-1:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:09):**  We'll just say thanks, but no thanks.  
**[1:07:17-1:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:17):**  The change in land value is significant the way it is.  
**[1:07:20-1:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:20):**  There may be opportunities to put small tourism developments in there.  
**[1:07:24-1:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:24):**  If we're next to a good surfing wave on our 8,000 hectare farm, there's no reason we can't  
**[1:07:31-1:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:31):**  put 20 hectares into a little surf spot.  
**[1:07:35-1:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:35):**  Why not?  
**[1:07:36-1:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:36):**  With great food for sure.  
**[1:07:38-1:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:38):**  Yeah, with great local regenerative food.  
**[1:07:44-1:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:44):**  But essentially because I'm partnering with local indigenous communities and it takes  
**[1:07:51-1:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:51):**  two years in general to gain these folks trust.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:56):**  We show up, generally we're invited, but even so we're a North American company from the  
**[1:08:05-1:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:05):**  US coming in and saying, hey, we want to do all that stuff.  
**[1:08:09-1:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:09):**  People don't trust us.  
**[1:08:10-1:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:10):**  They've seen many people knock on the door and say all kinds of stuff.  
**[1:08:13-1:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:13):**  Why should they trust us?  
**[1:08:15-1:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:15):**  And so it takes time to build trust and trust is the most valuable commodity.  
**[1:08:24-1:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:24):**  And if I were to go to these folks and say, hey, partner with us, work with us, this is  
**[1:08:30-1:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:30):**  what we're going to do.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:32):**  And at the same time I'm telling my investors, well, in 10 years we're going to sell to Unilever  
**[1:08:37-1:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:37):**  or we're going to sell to Nestle, right?  
**[1:08:39-1:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:39):**  Or we're going to sell to Cargill.  
**[1:08:42-1:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:42):**  That would be an explicit plan to betray the trust of the indigenous communities down the  
**[1:08:48-1:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:48):**  road, right?  
**[1:08:49-1:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:49):**  So our exit cannot be a typical exit.  
**[1:08:51-1:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:51):**  We're not going to sell to PE.  
**[1:08:53-1:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:53):**  We're not going to sell to a bigger shop that doesn't see the value of working with the  
**[1:08:59-1:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:59):**  local communities the way we see it, right?  
**[1:09:03-1:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:03):**  I'm not going to betray that trust, which means our exit has to be different, which  
**[1:09:07-1:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:07):**  is why VC is in general a bad fit.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:10):**  But development banks, green bonds, blue bonds, private equity and family offices, that's  
**[1:09:18-1:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:18):**  where starting out we're going to have to have the higher cost of capital on our first  
**[1:09:23-1:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:23):**  project.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:25):**  But eventually I see us funding almost every project through much lower cost of capital  
**[1:09:31-1:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:31):**  in the form of green and blue bonds, right?  
**[1:09:34-1:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:34):**  Because we'll have very valuable real assets underpinning our projects.  
**[1:09:43-1:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:43):**  We'll have recurring revenues.  
**[1:09:46-1:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:46):**  That's enough to say, okay, if our next project is $1.5 billion, that's fine for a green or  
**[1:09:53-1:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:53):**  a blue bond.  
**[1:09:55-1:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:55):**  If we've got the whole system proven out, if we've got recurring revenues, if we've  
**[1:09:59-1:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:59):**  got sales, if we've got blue carbon already developed, it's just the first one where we're  
**[1:10:03-1:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:03):**  going to have to take higher cost of capital.  
**[1:10:07-1:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:07):**  Like most developers.  
**[1:10:08-1:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:08):**  Yeah, like most developers.  
**[1:10:09-1:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:09):**  Exactly.  
**[1:10:10-1:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:10):**  Yeah.  
**[1:10:11-1:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:11):**  Do you see investors comfortable with that?  
**[1:10:14-1:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:14):**  Like people that have done renewable energy projects, for instance, that, oh, we recognize  
**[1:10:18-1:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:18):**  this, this is sort of the same as 20 years ago.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:21):**  It's very similar.  
**[1:10:22-1:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:22):**  It's very similar to the solar world 20 years ago.  
**[1:10:28-1:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:28):**  And we have, I mean, we're in the early days of this process.  
**[1:10:33-1:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:33):**  We have been talking with some family offices and some other groups for three to six months  
**[1:10:40-1:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:40):**  now, where we've more or less said, look, we're still too premature to really have this  
**[1:10:46-1:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:46):**  conversation seriously.  
**[1:10:47-1:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:47):**  Let's get to know each other.  
**[1:10:48-1:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:48):**  That's different now.  
**[1:10:49-1:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:49):**  I did three pitches last week and I'm doing another half dozen this week.  
**[1:10:55-1:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:55):**  But the fundraising mode.  
**[1:10:56-1:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:56):**  Yeah.  
**[1:10:57-1:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:57):**  But there are serious comparative advantages in our system.  
**[1:11:01-1:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:01):**  Like if you compare to a typical aquaculture, we are going to blow them out of the water  
**[1:11:05-1:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:05):**  financially.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:08):**  You look at a typical animal fodder system, like compare us to an alfalfa field.  
**[1:11:13-1:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:13):**  We have comparative advantages.  
**[1:11:16-1:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:16):**  Not just in the fact that we don't need to pay $10,000 per acre to get started.  
**[1:11:22-1:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:22):**  Not just in the fact that we can use seawater.  
**[1:11:27-1:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:27):**  I don't know if you saw this article, a farm raise link to it.  
**[1:11:30-1:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:30):**  Do you know Jace at Farm Raise?  
**[1:11:33-1:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:33):**  They're a US company.  
**[1:11:34-1:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:34):**  Does that ring a bell for you?  
**[1:11:35-1:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:35):**  I think we have been chatting, but we never interviewed them.  
**[1:11:39-1:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:39):**  So I don't know if I know.  
**[1:11:43-1:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:43):**  They were folks that I met at Stanford.  
**[1:11:47-1:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:47):**  But they're a company that, as I understand it, they help American farmers access public  
**[1:11:52-1:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:52):**  monies.  
**[1:11:53-1:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:53):**  Yeah, we chatted about it.  
**[1:11:54-1:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:54):**  I don't think we did.  
**[1:11:55-1:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:55):**  We didn't do an interview yet, but we definitely connected when they just launched.  
**[1:11:59-1:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:59):**  They linked to an article, or rather to a study from 18 months ago, I believe, that  
**[1:12:05-1:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:05):**  said, in general, regenerative agricultures are 70% more profitable.  
**[1:12:10-1:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:10):**  Which is a study by Jonathan Lantgren, which we had on the show twice.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:17):**  I will link it below.  
**[1:12:18-1:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:18):**  It's fascinating if you look at it.  
**[1:12:20-1:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:20):**  78% more profitable.  
**[1:12:22-1:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:22):**  We expect, I don't know if we'll get to 78%, but in the aquaculture world, we are going  
**[1:12:28-1:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:28):**  to have serious comparative advantages.  
**[1:12:32-1:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:32):**  And I expect that in 20 years, our model will be the standard model for a great deal of  
**[1:12:38-1:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:38):**  geographies because it is going to be a lot more profitable.  
**[1:12:43-1:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:43):**  So what would you do?  
**[1:12:44-1:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:44):**  Circular regenerative systems.  
**[1:12:45-1:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:45):**  Of course.  
**[1:12:46-1:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:46):**  Yeah.  
**[1:12:47-1:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:47):**  But what would you do if, as a final question, and I really let you go to your investor meeting  
**[1:12:51-1:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:51):**  because we've been talking for a while.  
**[1:12:55-1:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:55):**  What would you do if you had a billion dollars under management?  
**[1:12:57-1:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:57):**  That'd be the longest timeframe investment horizon if you want to, but it had to be put  
**[1:13:01-1:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:01):**  to work as an investment.  
**[1:13:03-1:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:03):**  What would you do?  
**[1:13:04-1:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:04):**  Yeah.  
**[1:13:05-1:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:05):**  So my follow-up question to this was, what's the risk profile of my limited partners on  
**[1:13:10-1:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:10):**  that billion dollar fund?  
**[1:13:12-1:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:12):**  You can go as risky as you want.  
**[1:13:14-1:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:14):**  Is this people with a high appetite for risk or a low appetite for risk?  
**[1:13:19-1:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:19):**  I would say high and you can choose.  
**[1:13:24-1:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:24):**  Because if I don't need to diversify on that portfolio, I have my eye set on a 300,000  
**[1:13:33-1:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:33):**  hectare site that I want to buy.  
**[1:13:36-1:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:36):**  It's a $350 million purchase just for the-  
**[1:13:40-1:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:40):**  You have some money left for development.  
**[1:13:42-1:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:42):**  I'm not going to say where it is.  
**[1:13:44-1:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:44):**  Of course not.  
**[1:13:45-1:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:45):**  No.  
**[1:13:46-1:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:46):**  I'm not.  
**[1:13:47-1:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:47):**  But you would put it in one, let's say one slash two.  
**[1:13:50-1:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:50):**  I'm asking this question not because I want to know dollar amounts of places, but what  
**[1:13:53-1:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:53):**  would you have prioritized?  
**[1:13:54-1:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:54):**  Maybe you say I would put everything in soil cover measurement tools or marketing of these  
**[1:14:03-1:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:03):**  seawater aquaculture plans or like what would you prioritize and you would go for land,  
**[1:14:09-1:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:09):**  which is interesting to know.  
**[1:14:10-1:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:10):**  I would go for land right now.  
**[1:14:14-1:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:14):**  A, you're not going to lose, there's no loss there.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:20):**  It's a real asset worth whatever it's worth and it's going to appreciate in value.  
**[1:14:25-1:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:25):**  You're going to buy very, very, very degraded land.  
**[1:14:27-1:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:27):**  You have to find a buyer at some point if you want to get out of it and if nobody sees  
**[1:14:31-1:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:31):**  value in there, it has value on paper, but of course only if you find a buyer.  
**[1:14:36-1:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:36):**  If you want to get out, you want to develop for sure.  
**[1:14:40-1:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:40):**  The other thing is I would invest in some particular geographies.  
**[1:14:45-1:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:45):**  So I would, of that billion, I would start a pilot farm in Morocco.  
**[1:14:51-1:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:51):**  I would do a pilot farm in Namibia.  
**[1:14:56-1:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:56):**  I would do an adapted version in Spain.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:02):**  I would automate our system, the RSA system, and then I'd go to Australia with it.  
**[1:15:07-1:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:07):**  Australia has easily got over a million hectares of degraded coastal land with easy access  
**[1:15:15-1:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:15):**  to some very big markets in East Asia.  
**[1:15:20-1:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:20):**  So I would do those.  
**[1:15:21-1:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:21):**  I would do those first farms in those geographies.  
**[1:15:25-1:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:25):**  I'd do like a big RSA on that 300,000 hectare landscape that I really want to get.  
**[1:15:37-1:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:37):**  But it would all go into RSA.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:38):**  And in fact, I would not be surprised if within a decade, if we are doing projects at that  
**[1:15:44-1:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:44):**  scale.  
**[1:15:45-1:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:45):**  I hope so.  
**[1:15:46-1:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:46):**  We need to go to the billion dollars, dollars per scale.  
**[1:15:51-1:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:51):**  We're not there yet.  
**[1:15:52-1:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:52):**  We've got to build our first project.  
**[1:15:54-1:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:54):**  We've got to tweak our system.  
**[1:15:56-1:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:56):**  We've got to develop the IP and formalize the IP, which is the next, that's the next  
**[1:16:02-1:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:02):**  three, four years of operations for us is getting this first set of pipeline financed  
**[1:16:07-1:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:07):**  and built.  
**[1:16:10-1:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:10):**  But after that, we have more leads than we can possibly follow up on right now, much  
**[1:16:15-1:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:15):**  more than we have the capacity to execute on if we wanted to.  
**[1:16:20-1:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:20):**  So expansion has the capacity to happen very quickly.  
**[1:16:26-1:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:26):**  And I don't think a billion will be too much.  
**[1:16:29-1:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:29):**  Considering, I mean, I always ask last question and then I don't.  
**[1:16:34-1:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:34):**  Considering what you know on what's possible, but also the state of the world, you've traveled  
**[1:16:38-1:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:38):**  a lot.  
**[1:16:39-1:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:39):**  Are you hopeful?  
**[1:16:40-1:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:40):**  Yeah.  
**[1:16:41-1:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:41):**  This is a great question.  
**[1:16:47-1:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:47):**  As a species, historically, we are terrible at preventing disasters.  
**[1:16:53-1:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:53):**  Right.  
**[1:16:54-1:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:54):**  We've been a horrible keystone species and horrible at preventing disaster.  
**[1:17:01-1:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:01):**  But we in terms of species on Earth, nothing compares to us in terms of adaptability.  
**[1:17:08-1:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:08):**  At least there are no other vertebrates that compare to us in terms of adaptability.  
**[1:17:18-1:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:18):**  There's no other mammal that's figured out how to live in every major biome.  
**[1:17:22-1:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:22):**  Limet and biome.  
**[1:17:24-1:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:24):**  We are very, very good at adapting and we can adapt very quickly.  
**[1:17:29-1:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:29):**  And history shows that.  
**[1:17:30-1:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:30):**  So my hope, and this is something that our company is, our company is climate mitigation,  
**[1:17:37-1:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:37):**  but it's also climate adaptation.  
**[1:17:42-1:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:42):**  I am not hopeful that we will prevent many of the disasters that we have seen coming  
**[1:17:51-1:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:51):**  for a long time.  
**[1:17:53-1:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:53):**  And look at the water situation right now.  
**[1:17:56-1:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:56):**  Right.  
**[1:17:57-1:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:57):**  How we've known for decades that the Ogallala Aquifer in the central US was being depleted.  
**[1:18:03-1:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:03):**  We haven't stopped depleting it.  
**[1:18:05-1:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:05):**  But once it's gone, we're going to adapt.  
**[1:18:09-1:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:09):**  Right.  
**[1:18:10-1:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:10):**  The Colorado River in the southwestern US, it's 15 million acre feet total.  
**[1:18:15-1:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:15):**  In general, 15 million acre feet.  
**[1:18:18-1:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:18):**  All that 15 million acre feet is already accounted for.  
**[1:18:21-1:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:21):**  Right.  
**[1:18:22-1:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:22):**  That rot belongs to somebody.  
**[1:18:26-1:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:26):**  Demand for water within the Colorado watershed is expected to grow by another 15 million  
**[1:18:32-1:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:32):**  acre feet in the next 25, 30 years or something.  
**[1:18:37-1:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:37):**  Right.  
**[1:18:38-1:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:38):**  We don't have, demand is going to increase by another Colorado River.  
**[1:18:42-1:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:42):**  There's only one Colorado River.  
**[1:18:43-1:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:43):**  Right.  
**[1:18:44-1:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:44):**  And 40% of that river, between 30 and 40%, is going exclusively to alfalfa.  
**[1:18:50-1:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:50):**  Right.  
**[1:18:51-1:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:51):**  That is one of the stupidest things we can do with that water.  
**[1:18:54-1:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:54):**  But we're still doing it.  
**[1:18:56-1:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:56):**  Right.  
**[1:18:57-1:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:57):**  So are we, is it politically feasible that we're going to change how all this water is  
**[1:19:03-1:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:03):**  used across a Byzantine system of laws?  
**[1:19:06-1:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:06):**  No.  
**[1:19:07-1:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:07):**  The water is going to run out.  
**[1:19:08-1:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:08):**  It's going to force adaptation.  
**[1:19:10-1:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:10):**  And then we're going to adapt.  
**[1:19:11-1:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:11):**  We're really good at adapting.  
**[1:19:12-1:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:12):**  Then we're going to build a lot of mangroves to bring back the rain.  
**[1:19:15-1:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:15):**  Yeah.  
**[1:19:16-1:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:16):**  I mean, it's-  
**[1:19:17-1:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:17):**  But not enough to build two Colorado rivers.  
**[1:19:19-1:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:19):**  So does that make me an optimist or a pessimist where I say, yeah, we're good at adapting  
**[1:19:25-1:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:25):**  and we're going to figure it out, but we're not going to prevent these disasters from  
**[1:19:29-1:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:29):**  happening?  
**[1:19:30-1:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:30):**  I don't know what that makes me.  
**[1:19:33-1:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:33):**  I don't know either, but it just came up as, I don't know, I had to think about the question  
**[1:19:38-1:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:38):**  as a good final one to, I wouldn't say summarize, but just to have a look inside your thoughts.  
**[1:19:46-1:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:46):**  I will say that I am a lot happier as a person working on solutions.  
**[1:19:55-1:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:55):**  I am not prone to despair or climate despair.  
**[1:19:59-1:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:59):**  I get sad about things, right?  
**[1:20:01-1:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:01):**  Like they just said that the Chinese manatee is now functionally extinct.  
**[1:20:07-1:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:07):**  They don't think it's anywhere.  
**[1:20:08-1:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:08):**  That breaks my heart.  
**[1:20:09-1:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:09):**  It does.  
**[1:20:10-1:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:10):**  It's really sad.  
**[1:20:15-1:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:15):**  But the fact that we're working on solutions that address biodiversity and carbon and local  
**[1:20:22-1:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:22):**  economies and food and water, like I feel a great deal of satisfaction working on the  
**[1:20:30-1:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:30):**  stuff I'm working on.  
**[1:20:33-1:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:33):**  And I'm confident we're going to be able to roll this out and make a difference.  
**[1:20:38-1:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:38):**  So, and let me close with one more thing.  
**[1:20:47-1:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:47):**  What underpins the regenerative movement is a kind of faith that humans can be a keystone  
**[1:20:55-1:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:55):**  species, right?  
**[1:20:57-1:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:57):**  Now that is proven if we look at some indigenous societies, not all indigenous societies, but  
**[1:21:04-1:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:04):**  some indigenous societies have had systems that lasted for tens of thousands of years  
**[1:21:09-1:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:09):**  sustainably, right?  
**[1:21:12-1:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:12):**  And now it's what?  
**[1:21:13-1:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:13):**  It's 5% of human population is indigenous and they're stewarding 80% of the biodiversity.  
**[1:21:20-1:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:20):**  They are the example that humans can be a keystone species.  
**[1:21:26-1:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:26):**  They're the proof of it.  
**[1:21:30-1:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:30):**  And I don't want to engage in the noble savage stereotype.  
**[1:21:34-1:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:34):**  I don't, indigenous people are just people.  
**[1:21:37-1:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:37):**  They have a set of cultures and rules and practices that have allowed them to foster  
**[1:21:43-1:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:43):**  biodiversity and be stewards of the earth.  
**[1:21:46-1:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:46):**  That's what all of us should be.  
**[1:21:49-1:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:49):**  At the same time, we're all indigenous to earth.  
**[1:21:54-1:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:54):**  All of us.  
**[1:21:55-1:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:55):**  We belong on this planet and our role is to be a keystone species.  
**[1:21:59-1:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:59):**  And that idea underpins the whole regenerative movement.  
**[1:22:05-1:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:22:05):**  And for me, some of the most sublime experiences I have ever had was seeing birds build nests  
**[1:22:16-1:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:22:16):**  in trees that I grew in a place where people told me trees aren't supposed to grow.  
**[1:22:26-1:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:22:26):**  Seeing bees swarm on a site where people said, we haven't seen bees here for 40 years.  
**[1:22:35-1:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:22:35):**  And to know that our work facilitated that.  
**[1:22:40-1:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:22:40):**  I didn't go and trap bees and bring them over.  
**[1:22:45-1:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:22:45):**  I created the microclimate and facilitated a way for nature to come back.  
**[1:22:53-1:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:22:53):**  And all of us can do that on a tiny or large scale.  
**[1:22:59-1:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:22:59):**  But what that did to me internally was quite profound.  
**[1:23:07-1:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:23:07):**  And one of the things that I think regenerative resources will do is allow people to participate  
**[1:23:14-1:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:23:14):**  in that somewhat by proxy.  
**[1:23:19-1:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:23:19):**  But I think if more of us had that kind of experience, it would bode well for us and  
**[1:23:25-1:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:23:25):**  for every other species on this planet.  
**[1:23:28-1:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:23:28):**  And that to me is the personal underpinning of why I'm part of the regenerative movement.  
**[1:23:36-1:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:23:36):**  And with that, I think it's a perfect end to this conversation.  
**[1:23:41-1:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:23:41):**  I don't think it's the last time.  
**[1:23:42-1:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:23:42):**  I hope it's not the last time we connect.  
**[1:23:44-1:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:23:44):**  I want to thank you so much for the work you do.

**[1:24:40-1:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:24:40):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:24:44-1:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:24:44):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:24:49-1:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:24:49):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[1:24:53-1:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:24:53):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:24:54-1:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:24:54):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:24:59-1:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:24:59):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[1:25:03-1:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:03):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:25:08-1:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:08):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:25:11-1:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:11):**  How have we built our decision making framework?

**[1:25:25-1:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:25):**  How to approach this space?  
**[1:25:27-1:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:27):**  For whom is this course?  
**[1:25:28-1:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:28):**  You, the soil builders and investors in the space.  
**[1:25:31-1:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:31):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,

**[1:25:46-1:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:46):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[1:25:48-1:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:48):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[1:25:51-1:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:51):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[1:25:56-1:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:56):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[1:26:01-1:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:01):**  Is this course free?  
**[1:26:02-1:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:02):**  No.  
**[1:26:03-1:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:03):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:26:05-1:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:05):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[1:26:09-1:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:09):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[1:26:14-1:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:14):**  different means.  
**[1:26:15-1:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:15):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  
**[1:26:20-1:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:20):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:26:23-1:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:23):**  Thank you.  
**[1:26:24-1:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:24):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:26:25-1:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:25):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:26:31-1:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:31):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[1:26:33-1:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:33):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:26:38-1:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:38):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:26:44-1:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:44):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[1:26:48-1:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:48):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:26:50-1:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:50):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:26:55-1:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:55):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:26:59-1:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:59):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[1:27:03-1:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:27:03):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:27:04-1:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:27:04):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:27:06-1:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:27:06):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:27:09-1:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:27:09):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:27:13-1:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:27:13):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:27:15-1:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:27:15):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:27:20-1:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:27:20):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or whatever you're drinking.

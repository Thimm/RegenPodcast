### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:14):**  The rule in good real estate investments is to buy low when nobody sees value and then  of course create value.  Our guest today argues that the opportunity in Regenec lies in buying extremely degraded  
**[0:00:26-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:26):**  coastal lands.  In places where there is literally no life, no photosynthesis, no soil, but a lot of waves  with seawater.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:33):**  And using this seawater to raise fish but mostly shrimp and other aquaculture species,  use the wastewater of these shrimps to restore mangroves and grow saltwater species, which  in turn produce most of the feed for the shrimp.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:47):**  Not 100% close look but a lot better than degraded coastlands without any soil.  Feasible?  Probably.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:00:54):**  The forest today has grown many many trees without outside irrigation in the Saudi Arabian  desert.  Practical and scalable?  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:00):**  Let's see.  Investable?  Let's find out.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:03):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:20-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:20):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:31-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:31):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:01:43):**  To make it easy for fans to support our work we launched our membership community and so  many of you have joined us as a member.  Thank you.

**[0:02:17-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:17):**  landscapes into productive ecologies.  Welcome Neil.  Thanks Colin, it's great to be here.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:24):**  And to start with a personal question, how did you end up in the soil movement?  Let's call it like that.  I mean, many people will know some of your work.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:32):**  I will let you introduce yourself.  We'll definitely put a very famous video of you in the links below.  But how did you roll into this?  
**[0:02:42-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:42):**  Or how did you end up spending your time focused on soil and mangroves?  You were obviously going to talk about that.  Let's say the regeneration movement.  
**[0:02:51-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:02:51):**  So I got into the regeneration movement largely as a result of travel.  I spent a lot of time in Guatemala when I was younger and some time in the Caribbean  as well.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:06):**  And that's where my interest, it kind of came by way of poverty actually.  I became very interested in poverty in my early 20s.  Sometime in there I made the connection between poverty and land use and got very interested  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:25):**  in sustainable agriculture.  You remember when or where?  Was it a click or was it a gradual process?  
**[0:03:31-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:31):**  Oh no, I was living in a little town called Tecolotan, which is in kind of central Guatemala,  now central Guatemala, and meeting with corn farmers who were telling me about how their  corn yield was going down and they were facing drought.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:03:57):**  And they were debating over if they needed to switch crops or if they needed to buy more  inputs.  And I think these were some of the poorest folks I've ever met, you know, and we helped  
**[0:04:12-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:04:12):**  them dig a well.  We helped them with a little bit of water access stuff.  But that would have been 2001, when really maybe 2002.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:04:30):**  And I went back and went to school.  I came back to the States, I went to school, ended up studying Arabic and economics.  But the passion for sustainable ag and as well as sustainability in the built environment,  
**[0:04:50-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:04:50):**  they kind of became my hobby.  I read probably between 2003 and 2008 or so, I kind of read everything I could get my hands  on on those subjects, but it wasn't what I was doing professionally.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:05:10):**  And then in 2010, I was offered the chance to join the El Bela project in Saudi Arabia.  And that was my chance to get into this stuff professionally.  So at the time, I had very little experience, aside from, you know, voluntary work in Latin  
**[0:05:36-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:05:36):**  America.  But it was my chance to pivot into the kind of thing I really wanted to do professionally.  So I started doing this professionally in 2010.  
**[0:05:49-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:05:49):**  And that project, I spent eight and a half years, eight, eight and a half years working  with tribes of settled nomads in the Saudi desert, prototyping a system to reverse desertification,  restore the indigenous grazing patterns and the indigenous livelihoods, and in a sense,  
**[0:06:15-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:15):**  create rural wealth by reestablishing ecological function.  So that project was, it ended up being very heavy on the regenerative and very light on  the agriculture, but it was a regenerative ag aimed at a silvopasture system.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:35):**  And that was a massive adventure.  The reason I was hired onto that was more because of my language, culture and leadership  skills more than for my proven record on reversing desertification.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:52):**  Right?  It was that.  And not so many people, I think, that have the full package and on the language side  
**[0:06:58-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:06:58):**  and cultural and the practicalities of that.  There was a concerted effort to find someone that would be viewed as politically neutral  and tribally neutral.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:07:11):**  And I think that's why they picked an American and a Christian was because I would show up  generally with, as a total foreigner, and therefore I could establish a guest status.  And in Arab culture and particularly in Bedouin culture, there are very strict rules about  
**[0:07:32-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:07:32):**  how guests are treated.  And so that was kind of the social and cultural entry point for that project to happen.  But we did, you know, we made thousands of mistakes in that project, prototyping different  
**[0:07:50-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:07:50):**  things, doing lots of small trials, and we had a few very big successes.  And the, I don't want to talk too much about the results of that because they're all still  under NDA, but the project itself was tiny, right?  
**[0:08:10-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:10):**  It was like a hundred acres.  But we did have a full watershed.  We had the mountains, we had wadis, we had kind of an artificially delineated alluvial  
**[0:08:21-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:21):**  plain, and so it was a fractal of the geography of the entire west coast of the Arabian Peninsula.  And that was deliberate.  We wanted something small enough so that we could prototype and see some successes, but  
**[0:08:36-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:36):**  that would then lead to greater application.  I left Al-Baitha in 2018, determined to not do nonprofit work ever again, unless it was  me funding it, right?  
**[0:08:54-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:08:54):**  If in the future I'm a philanthropist of some sort and able to fund my own nonprofit stuff,  then I'll do it.  What's the main reason?  
**[0:09:02-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:02):**  You sound very convinced.  What's the main reason for that?  The, what we built in Al-Baitha was culturally, ecologically sustainable, if not regenerative.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:18):**  But because we were a nonprofit organization and because we were prototyping, the financial  side of things was always a struggle, right?  Which is typical of all nonprofits, right?  
**[0:09:30-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:30):**  You spend a huge amount of energy.  Yeah.  On getting the money in and not so much on putting it to work.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:37):**  Well, exactly.  And so for, after eight years of running a nonprofit, I said, okay, whatever I do next,  it's got to make money because that's how, that's how the snowball effect happens, right?  
**[0:09:52-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:09:52):**  If you're making money, then you can go do it again.  So where did you go next?  Like what was that with such a strong conviction and very understandable, I think many people  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:00):**  in this podcast would be nodding right now.  Like of course.  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:05):**  What's next?  And it's, so I left Al-Baitha.  With that experience, I'll put a video below.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:09):**  There's some great, like the difference and the learnings there and just the sheer possibilities  are fascinating, especially visually as well.  So after you've done that, on the, let's say the social side and the soil side, regeneration  
**[0:10:24-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:24):**  side, where do you take that experience?  So knowing that I knew nothing about starting a business, I went to Stanford for a year  and did what's called the MSX program.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:36):**  It's essentially a one-year MBA at Stanford for people who are mid-career.  So I did a year at Stanford where I met my current partners through a sustainability  center there.  
**[0:10:50-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:10:50):**  We actually won a grant from the Tomcat Center for Sustainability, which was kind of the  first revenues we got in regenerative resources.  But I went to Stanford and said, okay, I'm going to start this new thing I've never done  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:06):**  before.  I know I'm going to make a lot of mistakes.  If I go to a business school and at least do some case studies and some learning and  
**[0:11:13-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:13):**  get some tutelage and build a network, then I can avoid mistakes when I try to, whatever  I try to do next, I know it's going to be a for-profit.  I know it's going to be entrepreneurship.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:28):**  And so I was at Stanford from 2018 to 2019, and we incorporated regenerative resources  August of 2019.  So it was two months after graduation that that happened.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:43):**  And it was very serendipitous because I was still thinking I was going to be doing a somewhat  standard agroforestry business is what I imagined going into Stanford and coming out.  What is to you?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:11:59):**  Regenerative resources is very different.  What is a standard agroforestry business?  What was it back in the day when you entered in your mind?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:06):**  I was thinking primarily about arable land or hyperarid agroforestry because that's what  we did in Elbeida was hyperarid agroforestry.  And so there were ideas about taking a real estate angle to that.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:22):**  There are ideas about breeding and patenting some trees that are largely forgotten, but  have been used extensively historically.  So what changed in that year?  
**[0:12:37-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:37):**  What made it go, I would say towards the extreme quote unquote side or much more of a generative  side?  So I actually think that's where the biggest opportunity is, is the highly degraded non-arable  
**[0:12:53-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:12:53):**  landscapes because the barriers to entry are a lot lower and because the potential transformation  is a lot higher.  Like if I go and buy an acre of corn in Iowa for $10,000, it may be somewhat degraded after  
**[0:13:17-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:13:17):**  decades of mono-cropping corn, but it's still got soil.  It's still understood to be arable and agricultural land.  It still costs $10,000 an acre to get it.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:13:33):**  As the land we're looking at, some of it we can get for $500 an acre.  Like in good real estate, the difference is made when you buy it.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:13:45-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:13:45):**  And so the barriers to entry are lower, the potential transformation is a lot higher and  it can actually be just as profitable as a field of corn with much lower input costs.  And that's the answer to your question of what's something about regenerative agriculture  
**[0:14:08-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:08):**  that most people don't think is true.  That is true.  We can transform highly degraded land into extremely productive land in a way that doesn't  
**[0:14:21-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:21):**  duplicate the common problems of mono-crop systems.  What kind of landscape are we?  You say it's so much more degraded, this is an audio podcast obviously, walk us through  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:33):**  visually, look what kind of...  How should we...  Because we can all imagine an acre of corn in Iowa.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:39):**  Most people I think can or you can Google that.  What should I imagine the kind of landscapes or lands you are looking at and get excited  about because of the potential?  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:48):**  What do we see there?  What do we feel?  What do we smell?  
**[0:14:51-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:14:51):**  So let me talk about regenerative resources a little bit to answer that question.  We are focused on coastal landscapes and largely barren or degraded coastal landscapes.  Generally in the subtropics or the tropics.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:10):**  And what you can...  If you are sitting on one of our sites in a pre-development phase, it's extremely windy,  it's very salty, there is no soil, no water and no photosynthesis.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:27):**  Not a very nice place to be.  Hyperarid, well you do have the sound of the waves.  Which is nice.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:33):**  Hitting the beach, that's nice.  But this is land that nobody sees any value in whatsoever.  It is...  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:43):**  And yet you do.  Salt pans and...  Oh yeah.  
**[0:15:47-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:15:47):**  Yeah, yeah, that's what we are looking for.  And so what we have developed, or rather what my partners have been working on, they have  a 50-year history of developing the system that we are now rolling out.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:02):**  And it's built on the work of a scientist named Carl Hodges, who is a big fish in a  medium-sized pond.  A very renowned scientist in his day.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:15):**  He passed away two years ago.  But Carl Hodges was the first person to be able to replicate the life cycle of shrimp  in an aquaculture facility.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:26):**  So the entire shrimp aquaculture world starts with him.  But he immediately went into trying to make that system circular.  So he, in the 1960s, he got a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to catalog halophytic  
**[0:16:45-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:45):**  plants with cropping potential.  Halophytes are plants that grow in seawater.  And probably the most well-known is mangroves.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:16:56):**  Mangroves are halophytes, but there are also annual halophytes.  Probably the most well-known that is edible is salicornia, which is also known as sea  beans or samphire or sea asparagus, which grows all over the world.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:17:13):**  But there are hundreds of halophytes with cropping potential, if they are to be developed.  And so what Carl imagined in a world where you've got freshwater scarcity and soil depletion  is, well, the ocean is functionally infinite.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:17:39):**  And if we can grow our food with seawater on degraded coastal land, then we can develop  an agriculture that is drought-proof, that never cares about freshwater, and that can  use some of the worst land or some of the least biodiverse land on the planet to address  
**[0:17:57-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:17:57):**  issues of food, water security, but also climate and biodiversity and cooling and energy to  some degree as well.  And there's a quote I like to use by Denis Bushnell.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:16):**  Denis Bushnell is the longest-serving chief scientist at NASA in the history of—he's  been a chief scientist there for three or four decades.  And I'll paraphrase him.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:28):**  But he talks a lot about greening deserts.  And when he does, he talks about using saltwater to do it.  So his quote is, we're talking about halophytes.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:43):**  If we can green the desert with halophytes, then we can solve food, water, climate, and  energy.  And so this is—conceptually, this is an idea that has been studied a great deal.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:18:58):**  There are a number of academic institutions, international and within the U.S., that are  dedicated to studying halophytic cropping.  And my partners were the first to do it commercially.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:15):**  They ran a project—  Yeah, because that's always the question.  It's great to be doing this in an academic environment.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:21):**  We know it's possible.  But then what holds it back to do it?  Commercially at a certain scale and does certain impact?  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:29):**  Like why don't we see the coastal plains?  What you just described, we have way too much of that, and it's not being grown with halophytes,  basically.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:36):**  So what is or was holding it back?  There's a lot holding it back.  Some of it is that the barrier to entry on these kinds of projects is very high.  
**[0:19:47-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:19:47):**  Some of it has to do with the lack of familiarity.  In Carl's case, Carl was a brilliant scientist and not a great marketer or a great businessman.  And so he was the scientist that developed this.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:01):**  They did develop a commercial scale farm in Eritrea from 1999 to 2004.  They have done components of this in Mexico previously in Bahia Aquino and Puerto Pinoasco.  But in Eritrea, by year two, they were cash flow positive.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:24):**  They were exporting multiple crops to London and Paris.  They had 800 locals employed.  They had a War Widows Cooperative providing fodder for the locals' camels off of this  
**[0:20:40-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:40):**  system.  That was the first commercial version of this.  And that was somewhat modeled on conventional agriculture.  
**[0:20:48-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:20:48):**  They were using mangroves to some degree.  One effort to get this done in Egypt was thwarted by the events in 2011.  And I met these guys while at Stanford.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:04):**  And so what we are rolling out now is kind of the 2.0 version of what was done at Eritrea.  Where you learned at Stanford to talk the tech version.  The 2.0.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:15):**  Yeah.  Well, there is technology that we're incorporating now.  The language matters as well.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:21):**  But it's also that there's a lot more regenerative ag technique being applied to this system.  Whereas, I mean, if you look at the photos of Eritrea, there are large swaths of monocropped  halophytes.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:36):**  And so we're...  Do halophytes as the, let's say, the non-salty water crops thrive in monoculture?  Or is it the same as any, let's say, agriculture system?  
**[0:21:49-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:21:49):**  No, it has some advantages even there because you don't get weeds when you're irrigating  with seawater, for instance, right?  Because weeds can't grow in it.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:00):**  So there are still advantages if you just compare monocrop to monocrop of halophyte  to typical crops.  There are also disadvantages because they're largely undeveloped crops.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:14):**  But so now we are taking agroforestry techniques, incorporating those into halophytic cropping  systems and integrating with aquacultures.  And so the system we're doing now that we're going to roll out, we estimate will have significant  
**[0:22:36-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:36):**  comparative advantages to what was done in Eritrea, let alone comparative advantages  to conventional crops that are in markets that we're going to be competing against.  Yeah.  
**[0:22:48-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:22:48):**  What kind of crops are we talking about?  Because you mentioned sea asparagus, but there are hundreds of others.  What should we imagine as what kind of food or feed are we talking about?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:00):**  So well, let's talk about aquaculture in a typical onshore aquaculture system.  And this is going to be an oversimplification.  In a typical onshore aquaculture system, they're dumping their wastewater into the ocean and  
**[0:23:18-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:18):**  creating dead zones with it.  That's also their source of water in the aquaculture system.  And so they're introducing disease vectors, they're introducing greater risk by using  
**[0:23:30-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:30):**  polluted water as their source, but they're also causing massive environmental problems  and importing all of their feed, and in a typical onshore aquaculture system, feed is  60% of the operating cost.  
**[0:23:48-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:23:48):**  It is easily the largest cost in running a shrimp farm or a salmon farm, right, or what  have you.  What we do is we use the wastewater from the aquaculture to grow a mangrove agroforestry,  
**[0:24:06-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:06):**  and then off of that mangrove agroforestry, we have a proprietary feed for the aquaculture.  So that creates serious comparative advantages, whether you're talking about resilience, whether  you're talking about risk and disease vectors, whether you're talking about cost of inputs,  
**[0:24:27-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:27):**  right?  Right now, all the aquaculture producers globally are freaking out because the price of wheat  and soybeans are going up, right?  
**[0:24:36-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:36):**  So their feed is getting more expensive, which means their product is getting more expensive  to sell, but supply hasn't gone down so the price isn't changing, right?  A lot of people are getting squeezed right now because their inputs are getting more  
**[0:24:51-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:24:51):**  expensive, right?  And the reason their inputs are getting more expensive is because of the war in Ukraine,  because fertilizers are so much more expensive, and because of drought, right?  
**[0:25:03-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:03):**  Whether you're talking about China or Southern California or Europe or many, many other places,  we're in the midst of, or rather in the early stages of what could end up being serious  water crisis, and that affects every agricultural industry, including aquaculture.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:25):**  So the fact that our system is circular, where we can produce, we're not at the point that  we can do 100% of our feed.  But a good chunk already makes a big difference.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:37):**  And what kind of species are you planning to, are you growing in terms, because that's  always in aquaculture, the big component feed species is fundamental.  In Mexico, we're doing shrimp.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:48):**  In Mexico, we're doing shrimp.  Probably the Pacific white leg and the blue shrimp.  The blue is local.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:25:56):**  I am not an expert in shrimp aquaculture, but we've got a team member who has 30 years  experience only running shrimp aquaculture.  Would you say then the aquaculture piece is sort of the, let's say the engine that then  
**[0:26:12-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:12):**  feeds the mangrove and comes out?  I mean, that's difficult to say, obviously, in a circular system, but that's the starting  point.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:19):**  It is the biological engine for the rest of the whole thing, because that is where our  source of phosphorus and nitrogen comes from, as well as the micronutrients that are in  the ocean water.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:32):**  But it is a seawater agriculture.  I need to reemphasize that.  We are using no fresh water in our whole system.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:38):**  Yeah, it's good to emphasize that.  We do not need it.  And that is the revolutionary thing with our system.  
**[0:26:49-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:26:49):**  What scale are we talking about?  What's the minimum size we should envision?  We're not interested in farms smaller than 5000 hectares.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:00):**  We are involved in a project that may go up to 150,000 hectares.  But there are at least 15 million hectares globally where our system could be deployed.  15, one five.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:16):**  Which is massive.  It's small compared to the total amount of arable land under agriculture.  But this is not on agriculture now.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:29):**  And it's not on arable land.  This is on totally dead land.  And so beyond the mangroves, what else?  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:39):**  That kickstarts the system back.  Basically, you're producing a big chunk of your feed.  And then what else?  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:44):**  Like what kind of, beyond the perennials, what else are you introducing into a system  like that?  It depends on where we are.  
**[0:27:51-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:27:51):**  But for instance, if we were going to do a fodder heavy system, we'd do a lot of atroplex.  We'd do a lot of saltbush.  We'd do sarcochornia instead of salicornia.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:04):**  But then there's also things like distichlus, which used to be a staple crop in the Colorado  Delta and is largely unknown or forgotten now.  But salicornia, distichlus, sea aster, atroplex, saltbush.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:22):**  There are lots of different options.  And we don't want to introduce a new species when we're developing a farm.  So we tailor the design to local ecosystems as well as to markets.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:37):**  Because what is the market like when you say it's largely forgotten?  You mentioned it a few times on a few discrops.  How difficult, what's the market risk?  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:45):**  How difficult is it?  I mean, on the shrimp side, I get it.  Lower input costs, much better margin.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:50):**  That seems to be quote unquote, like a no brainer.  But on the crop side, that might be more challenging.  How is that?  
**[0:28:57-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:28:57):**  No, it's not that the crop is more challenging.  It's about what's the right market for it.  So for instance, one of the things that we produce is a high quality animal fodder that  
**[0:29:11-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:11):**  is comparable with corn silage.  When you look at the protein, when you look at the fiber, when you look at the ash content,  when you look at all that stuff, corn silage is comparable.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:28):**  And so we can go into a country like Egypt, where they're importing 75% of all their fodder  for their dairy and meat industries, and say, hey, Egypt, you've got all this coastline  on the Red Sea that's mostly undeveloped.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:46):**  There is no water there.  Why don't we grow one of these systems and we can start reducing your imports of animal  fodder?  
**[0:29:55-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:29:55):**  We can supply that for your goats, your sheep and your camels and supplement for the cattle.  And we're not going to use any of your fresh water to do it.  That is a very compelling pitch.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:30:14):**  Particularly, I mean, Egypt is one of the world's largest importers of wheat.  So when we're talking about food security, they're very good at aquaculture.  That's one of the reasons I like Egypt is because they've got the expertise on hand  
**[0:30:31-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:30:31):**  to be able to build one of these systems.  Very good human resources there.  But when we're talking about food and water security, animal fodder is a massive both  
**[0:30:44-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:30:44):**  driver of desertification and a massive cause of insecurity in places like the Middle East  or India, Pakistan, or even areas of Latin America.  And so that's a key market that we're going to get into is animal fodder.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:05):**  Aquaculture feed is also a market we're going to be in.  We will mostly produce for ourselves on our own farms first while we balance the system  and tweak things.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:16):**  But eventually our feed, right now most feed is one third wheat or one third soy, one third  corn or one third bycatch.  It's usually a mix of those four ingredients.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:33):**  If you can imagine shrimp don't eat soybeans in the wild.  How weird, they never find a field like that.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:31:43-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:31:43):**  There is no corn floating around in the mangroves where shrimp have their nursery.  I can't prove it, but just like cows are supposed to eat grass, shrimp aren't supposed to eat  soybeans and corn and wheat paste.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:03):**  It cannot be good for them.  I have faith that our feed will outperform what's conventional right now.  I just can't prove it.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:15):**  So what's the current status?  Because I think we as the global, we have talked about coastal agriculture and I wouldn't  say for an extremely long time, but partly maybe yes.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:28):**  How do we get this from a great thing on paper and has been studied a lot in academic research  to actually, because these are not the easiest countries we talk about.  These are not the easiest entry markets.  
**[0:32:39-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:32:39):**  These are not the easiest things to do from scratch basically.  What is next and how do we pull this literally out of the sand?  It helps that two of my co-founders are the pioneers of this system.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:01):**  And like I said, they have a 40, 50 year history of doing this.  Carl Hodge is a scientist I mentioned to you, was our chief science advisor when we incorporated  in 2019.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:14):**  He passed away last year, unfortunately.  But in a very real sense, the torch that he lit has been passed on to us.  So what's different now if they have been working on that for decades?  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:26):**  I'm just asking the annoying investor question, like why now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, they're great questions.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:33):**  One is the need is not as acute or the need was not as acute as it is now.  Two, the development of ecosystem service markets and the recognition of the value of  ecosystem services and in particular carbon.  
**[0:33:53-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:33:53):**  The development of the carbon market, the recognition of policymakers, of the reality  of all the different effects that we, all the stuff we group under the umbrella term  of climate change that is affecting populations and countries.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:13):**  And then the rest of it, I think, is somewhat that someone's got to take the risk to do  it first.  That knows what they're doing and actually has the capacity to execute and pull it off.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:28):**  But I think we're the first team with those qualifications.  And how difficult is it to talk to?  That's the, sorry, that's not too difficult already there.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:37):**  How has been the response from investors so far?  So we, the most traction we're getting, we got an angel investment in 2019 and we've  been in really kind of incubation mode ever since.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:34:54):**  We are just coming out of it.  So our first project, we are now starting the process to finance it.  It's an 8,000 hectare project and it's taken us this long to negotiate the rights.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:13):**  So we started scouting sites.  We started putting together a team.  We started developing political capital three years ago.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:23):**  And if you can imagine, mangroves are a protected species almost everywhere because we've lost  half of the world's mangroves in the last generation.  And if you can imagine going and talking to an environmental ministry person and saying,  
**[0:35:38-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:38):**  hey, we're going to farm mangroves.  It's quite a difficult conversation to have.  When we started out, the environmental ministry didn't even want to talk with us.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:50):**  They didn't even want to have a conversation.  Where are we talking or is that?  That's Mexico.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:35:59):**  Right.  Because they want to protect the mangroves as they should.  We had to get some help to get those first meetings set up.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:09):**  Luckily, by then we had some political capital locally from Baja California, which is where  our project is.  And after, at this point, we have a written letter of support from the environmental ministry  
**[0:36:26-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:26):**  in Mexico saying we approve the development of the first seawater farm that regenerative  resources is going to do.  We will study it.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:35):**  And if it works out, we want to assist in deploying it throughout the rest of the country.  So it went from we don't even want to talk to you to, all right, if it works, we want  to do it everywhere that we can do it.  
**[0:36:51-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:36:51):**  But that takes a lot of patience and a lot of know-how and a lot of support.  And that transformation, that shift is largely due to one of my co-founders who is a former  Swiss diplomat who fell in love with a Mexican lady 20 years and decided to move to Tijuana.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:37:16):**  She's phenomenal and has been the one largely navigating those waters.  So at this point, we have a number of sites selected.  We picked one as the one we wanted to do first.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:37:33):**  We have negotiated the right to purchase the first 2,000 hectares or so, slightly less  than 2,000.  Then negotiations to purchase the other 6,000.  
**[0:37:46-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:37:46):**  We have the promise that our permits will be expedited.  We have a local team with tremendous expertise.  And this is actually a case where we benefited from COVID because most of our team were working  
**[0:38:02-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:38:02):**  in Southeast Asia or Ecuador in various aspects of the aquaculture industry.  And because of COVID, they got sent home to Mexico.  And if they can work at home, they want to work at home.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:38:17):**  So we have snatched these guys up and they're phenomenal.  So we have a team, we have a land, we have a business model, we have the promise of permits,  all of which is necessary before you can go to a development bank or investors and say,  
**[0:38:38-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:38:38):**  okay, we're ready for this.  And that's very, very hard to do that.  It would have been impossible for us to do it without our angel investor back in 2019,  
**[0:38:52-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:38:52):**  who I think they saw the potential, they were willing to take the risk and be first in.  But without it, it would have been absolutely impossible.  Without them, it, we, because it is a three to five year process to get a decent sized  
**[0:39:12-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:12):**  project going like this.  Now once you've got a first one up and running, expansion by comparison is very simple, right?  You've already got the team, you've got recurring revenues from the project, you've got the  
**[0:39:25-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:25):**  proof of concept sitting there, and you've got a lot more resources.  So expansion within country is, we expect will happen comparatively rapidly.  Going to a new country, we expect will take another three, three, four years before you  
**[0:39:45-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:45):**  get the first project up and going.  But then expansion within country happens through that subsidiary and through local  leadership once everything's up and running.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:39:54):**  So it's, that's not an uncommon timeline for blue carbon projects, right?  Most blue carbon projects take three to five years to set up, which is why there is so  little supply of blue carbon in the world, because it's extremely difficult to get it  
**[0:40:12-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:12):**  to a point that it's de-risked enough for an investor to actually feel confident going  in.  Because how important is that carbon piece for the business model compared to the stream  
**[0:40:23-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:23):**  side and that sort of thing?  For our business model, it's a cherry on top.  We don't need it.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:30):**  It's just a positive externality of our system that we can monetize.  The way we are deploying it though, and this gets into a really critical piece of the carbon  world, if we're going to get into this subject.  
**[0:40:48-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:40:48):**  When we're talking about high quality carbon credits, right now you're talking about additionality  and permanence and leakage are kind of the three main considerations.  And there's a lot of skepticism in the nature-based world about the permanence of forest credits,  
**[0:41:05-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:05):**  right?  Because, well, what's going to stop people from cutting down your forest in 30 years,  right?  
**[0:41:13-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:13):**  And so one of our maxims is it doesn't make any sense to grow trees unless you address  why people are cutting down trees in the first place.  And this is not, I think this is tacitly understood by a lot of people, but largely undeveloped  
**[0:41:34-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:34):**  or unaddressed in I would say the majority of carbon projects where permanence in a forestry  project comes from sustainable economies.  Because otherwise it gets cut down.  
**[0:41:51-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:41:51):**  That's why we lost the mangroves.  That's why we lost the mangroves in the first place is in Southeast Asia mangroves are largely  lost because people are shrimp farmers or they set up aquaculture farms, right?  
**[0:42:05-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:42:05):**  But in Latin America and South America and West Africa, it's deforestation for charcoal  or to clear it and start doing agriculture or to build fish traps in the case in Ghana.  People are cutting down mangroves because they want to make a living, right?  
**[0:42:29-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:42:29):**  And so unless you provide an alternate living, people are going to keep cutting them down.  And that's what our seawater system builds, right?  And the name for this is regenerative seawater agriculture or RSA.  
**[0:42:46-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:42:46):**  That's what we call it now.  In Carl Hodges' time, they called it ISIS, integrated seawater agriculture systems.  Somehow the name ISIS just doesn't have the same kind of cache or positive connotation  
**[0:43:02-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:02):**  it used to.  So we now call it RSA or regenerative seawater agriculture.  But what regenerative seawater agriculture does is it builds a circular regenerative  
**[0:43:14-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:14):**  economy in these coastal areas.  So let me tell you one, there's a project we're working on in partnership with a few,  with a handful of fishing villages in Mexico.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:30):**  And their catch has decreased by 90% in the last decade, right?  So where they're used to catching 100 fish, they're now catching 10.  And they are facing total collapse of their communities.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:45):**  And this is a pattern happening everywhere.  Coastal fisheries are being degraded globally.  This is not something specific to Mexico.  
**[0:43:54-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:43:54):**  I have been either tangentially involved in or consulted with or been informed of other  similar projects in Senegal, Ghana, Gambia, Ecuador, Mozambique, Oman, where it's the  same, it may not be 90%, it might be a 50% drop in the last decade.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:20):**  But still destructive.  It's massive.  It is a massive, massive driver of degradation.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:26):**  Because what happens when you can't, you're a fisherman, your dad was a fisherman, your  grandpa was a fisherman, and you can't catch fish anymore, what are you going to do?  You're either going to poach illegal species, right?  
**[0:44:40-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:40):**  I have talked with families that are hunting sea turtles, because a sea turtle will feed  your family for a week, and they feel tremendously guilty about it.  They don't want to do it, but that's how they're feeding their family.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:44:55):**  You poach illegal species, or you start cutting the mangroves down.  So this poverty degradation trap, people are like, okay, short-term needs trump long-term  sustainability, I'm going to cut down these trees even though I know it hurts me in the  
**[0:45:15-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:15):**  long run, because that's the only option I've got.  That poverty degradation cycle needs economic development to interrupt it.  And that's what our RSA does.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:27):**  So with this group of fishing villages, we have a 30-year vision that we have developed  together.  And we are doing a strict mangrove restoration project with them at their request.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:42):**  And that's just a straight blue carbon project, mangrove restoration.  And so how do you work with those villages in Mexico?  How are they part of it?  
**[0:45:54-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:45:54):**  Well, we were invited to go meet with these folks by one of the villagers three years  ago.  And that began our engagement with them.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:09):**  Over time, we have developed very good relationships with...  There are more fishing villages in the area.  There are three that are working with us quite closely.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:26):**  And the long-term vision is we build an RSA on their land, and that creates jobs for the  fishermen so that the fishermen can put the fishery in rest.  Essentially, it allows them to stop fishing for three to five years, let the fishery rehabilitate,  
**[0:46:44-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:44):**  and then begin to fish again, but manage that fishery as a commons under sustainable management  techniques.  So in the end, we really envisioned three or four projects with these fishing villages,  
**[0:46:57-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:46:57):**  one of which is...  Or two of which are mangrove restoration and seagrass restoration, the mangrove restoration  we're already engaged in.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:06):**  The third would be developing an RSA farm big enough to hire all the fishermen and create  that local economy.  And then after that, put the fishery into rest for a number of years.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:18):**  And then we would not be part of this next part, but it allows them to work with the  government to set up either a cooperative or some kind of organization that allows them  to manage that fishery sustainably as a commons.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:34):**  That's like the 30-year vision with these fishing villages that we have engaged with.  The mangrove restoration project is the first one because it's actually easier to do than  setting up an RSA in this particular area.  
**[0:47:50-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:47:50):**  But that's how we see RSA being deployed in these kinds of circumstances, is this is the  economic system that intercepts and interrupts that poverty degradation trap.  And how, like the blue carbon piece, we hear a lot about it.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:09):**  I don't think we see too much.  How tricky is the market or how easy is the market?  You say there's not a lot of supply.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:18):**  How do you envision selling that part, even though it's, quote unquote, just a cherry?  But how difficult is that going to be or how easy will that be?  It's going to be super easy because we are where the bottleneck is.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:34):**  It'll be easy to sell.  Selling it will be a little bit tricky.  That's why supply is where the bottleneck is, is because it's very tricky to develop.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:45):**  In the RSA system, it's just a matter of building the system and doing the science so we can  get good estimates on the carbon.  We know it's going to sequester carbon.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:48:56):**  We don't know how much, particularly when it's net of all the infrastructure that goes  in.  But that informs a lot of our decisions.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:05):**  So we could go on the grid for all the power and pumping of that system.  But right now, the grid is basically diesel.  And so we're going to set up our own solar system.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:19):**  In the future, there's potential for wave energy as well on these systems.  But on our first project, it's going to be solar, which brings our carbon expenditures  way down.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:31):**  The kinds of buildings we do will largely be low carbon footprint buildings.  So it's not just going to be cement structures with lots of corrugated steel.  So the desire to be able to market our blue carbon comes net of the entire development.  
**[0:49:51-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:49:51):**  So that informs our decision making around that.  But then we know that mangroves sequester carbon more efficiently than any terrestrial  ecosystem.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:03):**  And we did do, or not we because I was not there, but my team did do initial studies  of this in Eritrea that gives us some baseline numbers and also informs, in some cases, how  our system will be different than what Eritrea was.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:19):**  But the science will be a little bit expensive, right, because somewhere between 70 and 90  percent of the carbon in our system will be soils rather than in biomass.  There's all sorts of shops popping up where they're like, we're going to use satellites  
**[0:50:37-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:37):**  to measure your carbon.  And I'm like, well, that's great for the biomass, but it tells us nothing about the soil.  And that's where 70 to 90 percent of the carbon is.  
**[0:50:48-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:50:48):**  There are, oh my goodness, there are dozens of new entities popping up where they're like,  we're going to verify your carbon with satellite data and then we're going to put it on chain  and we'll Web3 everything and refi your carbon.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:05):**  It doesn't address the issue, right?  The real issue is how do you inexpensively measure soil carbon?  We're just going to do it expensively at first and then that at least gives us a baseline  
**[0:51:20-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:20):**  estimate for expansion within that region.  Of course, the levels are going to be extremely low to begin with.  If you look at the land you're purchasing.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:31):**  The baseline is zero.  The baseline is easy to establish.  It's zero.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:38):**  There is no carbon in these soils.  It is salt and dust.  It's basically no soil.  
**[0:51:46-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:51:46):**  There's no soil at all because there's no photosynthesis.  So yeah, the baseline is easy.  There are a number of shops that we like that we are collaborating with in that world, some  
**[0:52:00-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:52:00):**  of which are Web3 oriented that seem to be ahead of the pack on that.  But for us in the RSA at least, our financial model is built basically without soil estimates  incorporated because we don't know what it's going to be, right?  
**[0:52:21-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:52:21):**  It's looking good because that, I mean, we've watched prices quadruple in the last three  years.  Blue carbon was $8 to $10 in 2019.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:52:33):**  It's now above $50.  High quality blue carbon, it's over $50 a ton right now.  So I mean, that bodes well for us because not only are we producing blue carbon in the  
**[0:52:49-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:52:49):**  RSA, but RSA in my opinion is the linchpin to successful blue carbon projects globally  because if you don't build an alternate economy, you're not going to have permanence, right?  So our blue carbon will be higher quality than standard stuff because we can address  
**[0:53:10-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:10):**  that permanence question a lot better than just a standard reforestation or restoration  project.  And that is one of the big questions.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:21):**  How do you guarantee that people aren't just going to come cut it down later when the checkbook  is tight and people can't tighten their belts anymore?  That's what they go and do.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:33):**  So what our system does is that it helps people that would otherwise be degrading that ecosystem.  It helps them become stewards because the ecosystem services of a mangrove forest are  so much higher than anything you could get out of cutting it down and selling it.  
**[0:53:53-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:53:53):**  If you look at the holistic value, just the services provided to the health of a fishery  and the quantity of fish that grow in a healthy fishery next to a mangrove forest versus an  unhealthy nursery or an unhealthy fishery next to a degraded mangrove forest, the difference  
**[0:54:13-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:13):**  is astounding, right?  But if you degrade the fishery, that's not helping you anymore and then you degrade the  mangrove forest and then you have total collapse of your community.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:24):**  So this is how you reverse that cycle and help people become stewards of those landscapes  rather than the major cause of degradation.  And what have you looked at?  
**[0:54:35-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:35):**  The scale you're operating in is the conversation around, let's say, stabilizing local climates  or what's the effect of the mangroves on the local, the full ecosystem?  You mentioned this, I see you start laughing.  
**[0:54:51-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:54:51):**  You cannot see that on the audio, but you mentioned that in the project in Saudi Arabia,  this was a fractal of the full landscape or a full watershed.  How is that thinking now and how has it been used or is it being used in these kinds of  
**[0:55:05-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:05):**  projects?  Because we talk a lot about carbon, but it seems like the water cycle is more interesting  than carbon.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:14):**  Maybe not to find out.  The water cycle is super interesting and I wish I could share with you who we're working  with to measure that stuff, but I can't.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:22):**  Then we'll talk about it at another time.  Well as soon as I can publicly say it, we'll do a press release because it's really exciting.  But the greater effect of this is that, so we talked about fishery health, we talked  
**[0:55:41-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:41):**  about carbon.  Beyond that, there's biodiversity, water, cooling, sea level rise, and storm protection.  So where in places like the Caribbean or Mexico where you do get hurricanes, mangroves are  
**[0:55:55-0:56:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:55:55):**  the greatest protection against hurricanes and our system will duplicate that ecosystem  service.  So for instance, if you're ever boating on the ocean and a big storm is coming in, you're  
**[0:56:06-0:56:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:06):**  supposed to park in the mangroves.  That is the safest place to go.  So storm surges, hurricanes, that is an ecosystem service.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:19):**  I'm not sure we have a way to monetize that right now.  If there is a way to monetize it, it would be with the reinsurance companies.  But then that's also very location specific.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:31):**  And the locations we're looking for tend to be rural.  We're not doing this next to a city like Miami.  Miami doesn't have thousands of acres of degraded barren land next to it.  
**[0:56:46-0:57:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:56:46):**  And if they did, they'd want to build more Miami, not build a farm on it.  So there's a mismatch there to some degree.  On the water cycle, we know our system will increase freshwater resources, both in terms  
**[0:57:03-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:03):**  of rainfall creation and in terms of intercepting flash floods and restoring shallow aquifers.  We don't know how much yet.  And that is something that we have a set of collaborations that we're going to put into  
**[0:57:18-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:18):**  practice to measure that on our first farm.  So in Eritrea, the project in Eritrea cooled the local climate by two degrees Celsius.  Wow.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:31):**  And how far did that get?  Local as in right above or right around?  Only in the immediate vicinity.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:39):**  But still?  That's massive.  But that was only a thousand hectare project.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:45):**  As you expand and grow to scale, the question is how many microclimates do you need to affect  or create before you start changing climate?  And I don't know the answer to that.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:57:59):**  Where is the microclimate?  Nobody knows, but it's a very valid question.  Yeah.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:04):**  We are going to answer that question as part of the R&D around our first farm.  And we have some really exciting collaborations built around that.  Are exciting compared to forests?  
**[0:58:15-0:58:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:15):**  What's the effect of mangroves?  Of course, because they are at the ocean of all the flooding and the storms, et cetera,  but in general, affecting the water cycle with their feet in the water.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:26):**  I mean, they did a lot.  Yeah.  It is the edge, the first edge within, if you're looking at a closed loop water cycle,  
**[0:58:35-0:58:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:35):**  it's one of the edges where you can make the biggest impact.  But so you've got the cooling, you've got the increase in water vapor from the evapotranspiration,  and you have an increase in ice nuclei, right, also from the evapotranspiration, right?  
**[0:58:58-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:58:58):**  Every tree does this, but they give off a part of their respiration, they give off volatile  organic compounds that in the atmosphere will break down into ice nuclei, and then they  assist with cloud creation, right?  
**[0:59:11-0:59:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:11):**  So that's the rainfall side of things.  That's not necessarily an effect that will be felt locally or even regionally, right?  So mapping out the precipitation shed of a given project is, I don't know that we're  
**[0:59:25-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:25):**  going to do that because it would be neat to know, but it doesn't necessarily move the  bottom line and it doesn't, if there's some PhD out there and you want to do like a post-doc.  Somebody wants to pay for the rain.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:39):**  If somebody wants to do that study, you are welcome to come and stay on our farm and measure  it, but that's not something we're going to pay for.  Do you envision like a situation at some point where this is, like in certain projects maybe  
**[0:59:52-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=0:59:52):**  where it's relatively easy quote unquote to measure and you know, okay, if we restore  X amount of hectares here, we know we influence precipitation like X kilometers or miles,  like could be quite far away because some of these systems are there of course not linear,  
**[1:00:09-1:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:09):**  but there could be interesting parties down the line that said, we would love for more  of this to happen because we need, why is that too complex?  It's not too complex.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:23):**  There are shops out there who do that kind of modeling.  I don't know that that would be compelling enough to say, could you get Panama to pay  for that in El Salvador?  
**[1:00:40-1:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:40):**  I don't think so.  For sure with blockchain you can.  Could you get Arizona to pay for that in Baja, California?  
**[1:00:51-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:00:51):**  I doubt it.  Not at this point.  Maybe if we had better modeling and proven the whole thing out, then maybe the reinsurance  
**[1:01:00-1:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:00):**  people do, but I don't think it's necessary.  I'm happy to provide.  This is one of the challenging things is we're trying to privately finance something that  
**[1:01:14-1:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:14):**  creates a great deal of public good.  It's the opposite of privatizing gains and making the losses public, which is what the  banks did in 2008.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:27):**  They privatized the gain, but make the public pay for it.  This is the opposite.  We are trying to privatize gains.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:32):**  Which is not a good investment.  I mean, it is if you create a lot of public good and a lot of good in general.  Is there a way to get private finance for a public good?  
**[1:01:46-1:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:01:46):**  It's very tricky.  But that those positive externalities will inform our marketing.  When we go retail to sell our goods, I'm going to be able to say, hey, you can buy shrimp  
**[1:02:04-1:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:04):**  that destroys the ocean or you can buy shrimp that grows a mangrove forest.  Which would you rather eat?  You know, I'll be able to say that in our marketing and we'll have the science and the  
**[1:02:17-1:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:17):**  proof to back it up.  But some of these externalities that are positive, we're just not going to be able to monetize  those in the near future.  
**[1:02:26-1:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:26):**  In the distant future, maybe.  I'm okay with that because it's awesome.  You know, it's awesome.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:38):**  To be able in the future to say, hey, Mr. Cork Farmer further up the watershed, we're  giving you this rain.  Just to be able to say that we're making it rain and to have the science to back it up.  
**[1:02:53-1:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:53):**  Who else can do that?  That's awesome.  Yeah.  
**[1:02:56-1:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:02:56):**  And probably you can.  I mean, you can model it and probably you can track it even and somehow link it back  to your mangrove forest where the evaporation started.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:07):**  That shouldn't be too...  I'm completely out of line here, but it shouldn't be too difficult for sure at least.  But that would be just being able to say we made it rain in this watershed.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:16):**  Not too much, not too little, but enough to make a proper rain.  That's on the rainfall side of things.  The other thing is that because we're in deserts, we're also dealing with flash floods.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:31):**  When it does rain, you tend to get flash floods.  And our system, instead of letting those flash floods run into the ocean, our system intercepts  those.  
**[1:03:40-1:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:40):**  That's part of the design process and part of where the Albeta project bleeds into our  work.  But by intercepting that and having...  
**[1:03:50-1:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:03:50):**  You have a kind of a sea water layer underneath our soil.  And then what it will do is it will create a freshwater lens where the freshwater will  float on top of the sea water.  
**[1:04:00-1:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:00):**  And then further up in the watershed, it will start to restore shallow aquifers.  So we will increase groundwater by intercepting that surface flow in addition to increasing  rainfall once we're at scale.  
**[1:04:15-1:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:15):**  So that's super cool.  I don't know that we can monetize that.  We don't really need to at this point.  
**[1:04:23-1:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:23):**  If there's an opportunity in the future, great.  And so, I mean, we could talk about this for hours, but I want to be conscious of your  time and ask a few questions because I know you have to go at some point for an investor  
**[1:04:35-1:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:35):**  meeting.  But what would you tell...  I mean, it sounds like we're in the project developer phase, which sort of reminds me  
**[1:04:41-1:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:41):**  of the renewable energy sector a number of years ago.  It depends where you are, which renewable...  But you have these shops like yourself that are privately funded in this case through  
**[1:04:51-1:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:04:51):**  a family office, through an angel investor, sorry.  And they are developing projects which obviously need other finance.  What would you tell investors now?  
**[1:05:00-1:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:00):**  What is their role now?  If they get excited about blue carbon mangroves, restoration, rainfall, the whole shebang,  what is their role?  
**[1:05:07-1:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:07):**  What should their role be?  Obviously, without giving investment advice, but what would you tell them as their role,  what they should take as their role to kickstart the system, this whole regeneration system?  
**[1:05:17-1:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:17):**  I mean, this is the role that I'm playing right now.  This is the phase that we are in.  We are actively financing our first pipeline of projects.  
**[1:05:28-1:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:28):**  And we're also doing an equity raise into RRC, the US entity.  And first off, we are not talking a lot with VC.  VC in general is a bad fit for this, in my opinion, because of the timeline and because  
**[1:05:47-1:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:47):**  of considerations about being partnered with local entities, our exit is going to look  different for our investors.  How come?  
**[1:05:56-1:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:05:56):**  What could be like an exit from the Mexican project or from a project?  How do you envision that?  We envision that the first money in, essentially, we're selling equity into the first project,  
**[1:06:12-1:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:12):**  where people get a percentage of the cash flow.  The change in land value also underpins the value of their share in that SPV.  But then when they want to exit, we're going to buy it.  
**[1:06:24-1:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:24):**  We're not going to IPO.  We're going to buy it back.  That's what we want to do.  
**[1:06:30-1:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:30):**  Just to make sure that the land never gets speculated or what's the reason behind it?  Or because you think it's such a good investment?  Both.  
**[1:06:38-1:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:38):**  Both.  We're the right people to manage it in partnership with our local partners.  Yeah, because you don't want at some point to cut down a gigantic hotel.  
**[1:06:51-1:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:51):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.  How do you do that?  That's also part of what informs the exit.  
**[1:06:58-1:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:06:58):**  How do you make sure that doesn't happen, that somebody comes with a billion dollars  and says, let's develop this coast into the next Miami?  Just a random example.  
**[1:07:09-1:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:09):**  We'll just say thanks, but no thanks.  The change in land value is significant the way it is.  There may be opportunities to put small tourism developments in there.  
**[1:07:24-1:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:24):**  If we're next to a good surfing wave on our 8,000 hectare farm, there's no reason we can't  put 20 hectares into a little surf spot.  Why not?  
**[1:07:36-1:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:36):**  With great food for sure.  Yeah, with great local regenerative food.  But essentially because I'm partnering with local indigenous communities and it takes  
**[1:07:51-1:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:07:51):**  two years in general to gain these folks trust.  We show up, generally we're invited, but even so we're a North American company from the  US coming in and saying, hey, we want to do all that stuff.  
**[1:08:09-1:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:09):**  People don't trust us.  They've seen many people knock on the door and say all kinds of stuff.  Why should they trust us?  
**[1:08:15-1:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:15):**  And so it takes time to build trust and trust is the most valuable commodity.  And if I were to go to these folks and say, hey, partner with us, work with us, this is  what we're going to do.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:32):**  And at the same time I'm telling my investors, well, in 10 years we're going to sell to Unilever  or we're going to sell to Nestle, right?  Or we're going to sell to Cargill.  
**[1:08:42-1:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:42):**  That would be an explicit plan to betray the trust of the indigenous communities down the  road, right?  So our exit cannot be a typical exit.  
**[1:08:51-1:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:08:51):**  We're not going to sell to PE.  We're not going to sell to a bigger shop that doesn't see the value of working with the  local communities the way we see it, right?  
**[1:09:03-1:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:03):**  I'm not going to betray that trust, which means our exit has to be different, which  is why VC is in general a bad fit.  But development banks, green bonds, blue bonds, private equity and family offices, that's  
**[1:09:18-1:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:18):**  where starting out we're going to have to have the higher cost of capital on our first  project.  But eventually I see us funding almost every project through much lower cost of capital  
**[1:09:31-1:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:31):**  in the form of green and blue bonds, right?  Because we'll have very valuable real assets underpinning our projects.  We'll have recurring revenues.  
**[1:09:46-1:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:46):**  That's enough to say, okay, if our next project is $1.5 billion, that's fine for a green or  a blue bond.  If we've got the whole system proven out, if we've got recurring revenues, if we've  
**[1:09:59-1:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:09:59):**  got sales, if we've got blue carbon already developed, it's just the first one where we're  going to have to take higher cost of capital.  Like most developers.  
**[1:10:08-1:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:08):**  Yeah, like most developers.  Exactly.  Yeah.  
**[1:10:11-1:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:11):**  Do you see investors comfortable with that?  Like people that have done renewable energy projects, for instance, that, oh, we recognize  this, this is sort of the same as 20 years ago.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:21):**  It's very similar.  It's very similar to the solar world 20 years ago.  And we have, I mean, we're in the early days of this process.  
**[1:10:33-1:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:33):**  We have been talking with some family offices and some other groups for three to six months  now, where we've more or less said, look, we're still too premature to really have this  conversation seriously.  
**[1:10:47-1:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:47):**  Let's get to know each other.  That's different now.  I did three pitches last week and I'm doing another half dozen this week.  
**[1:10:55-1:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:10:55):**  But the fundraising mode.  Yeah.  But there are serious comparative advantages in our system.  
**[1:11:01-1:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:01):**  Like if you compare to a typical aquaculture, we are going to blow them out of the water  financially.  You look at a typical animal fodder system, like compare us to an alfalfa field.  
**[1:11:13-1:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:13):**  We have comparative advantages.  Not just in the fact that we don't need to pay $10,000 per acre to get started.  Not just in the fact that we can use seawater.  
**[1:11:27-1:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:27):**  I don't know if you saw this article, a farm raise link to it.  Do you know Jace at Farm Raise?  They're a US company.  
**[1:11:34-1:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:34):**  Does that ring a bell for you?  I think we have been chatting, but we never interviewed them.  So I don't know if I know.  
**[1:11:43-1:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:43):**  They were folks that I met at Stanford.  But they're a company that, as I understand it, they help American farmers access public  monies.  
**[1:11:53-1:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:53):**  Yeah, we chatted about it.  I don't think we did.  We didn't do an interview yet, but we definitely connected when they just launched.  
**[1:11:59-1:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:11:59):**  They linked to an article, or rather to a study from 18 months ago, I believe, that  said, in general, regenerative agricultures are 70% more profitable.  Which is a study by Jonathan Lantgren, which we had on the show twice.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:17):**  I will link it below.  It's fascinating if you look at it.  78% more profitable.  
**[1:12:22-1:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:22):**  We expect, I don't know if we'll get to 78%, but in the aquaculture world, we are going  to have serious comparative advantages.  And I expect that in 20 years, our model will be the standard model for a great deal of  
**[1:12:38-1:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:38):**  geographies because it is going to be a lot more profitable.  So what would you do?  Circular regenerative systems.  
**[1:12:45-1:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:45):**  Of course.  Yeah.  But what would you do if, as a final question, and I really let you go to your investor meeting  
**[1:12:51-1:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:12:51):**  because we've been talking for a while.  What would you do if you had a billion dollars under management?  That'd be the longest timeframe investment horizon if you want to, but it had to be put  
**[1:13:01-1:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:01):**  to work as an investment.  What would you do?  Yeah.  
**[1:13:05-1:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:05):**  So my follow-up question to this was, what's the risk profile of my limited partners on  that billion dollar fund?  You can go as risky as you want.  
**[1:13:14-1:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:14):**  Is this people with a high appetite for risk or a low appetite for risk?  I would say high and you can choose.  Because if I don't need to diversify on that portfolio, I have my eye set on a 300,000  
**[1:13:33-1:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:33):**  hectare site that I want to buy.  It's a $350 million purchase just for the-  You have some money left for development.  
**[1:13:42-1:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:42):**  I'm not going to say where it is.  Of course not.  No.  
**[1:13:46-1:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:46):**  I'm not.  But you would put it in one, let's say one slash two.  I'm asking this question not because I want to know dollar amounts of places, but what  
**[1:13:53-1:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:13:53):**  would you have prioritized?  Maybe you say I would put everything in soil cover measurement tools or marketing of these  seawater aquaculture plans or like what would you prioritize and you would go for land,  
**[1:14:09-1:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:09):**  which is interesting to know.  I would go for land right now.  A, you're not going to lose, there's no loss there.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:20):**  It's a real asset worth whatever it's worth and it's going to appreciate in value.  You're going to buy very, very, very degraded land.  You have to find a buyer at some point if you want to get out of it and if nobody sees  
**[1:14:31-1:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:31):**  value in there, it has value on paper, but of course only if you find a buyer.  If you want to get out, you want to develop for sure.  The other thing is I would invest in some particular geographies.  
**[1:14:45-1:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:14:45):**  So I would, of that billion, I would start a pilot farm in Morocco.  I would do a pilot farm in Namibia.  I would do an adapted version in Spain.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:02):**  I would automate our system, the RSA system, and then I'd go to Australia with it.  Australia has easily got over a million hectares of degraded coastal land with easy access  to some very big markets in East Asia.  
**[1:15:20-1:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:20):**  So I would do those.  I would do those first farms in those geographies.  I'd do like a big RSA on that 300,000 hectare landscape that I really want to get.  
**[1:15:37-1:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:37):**  But it would all go into RSA.  And in fact, I would not be surprised if within a decade, if we are doing projects at that  scale.  
**[1:15:45-1:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:45):**  I hope so.  We need to go to the billion dollars, dollars per scale.  We're not there yet.  
**[1:15:52-1:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:15:52):**  We've got to build our first project.  We've got to tweak our system.  We've got to develop the IP and formalize the IP, which is the next, that's the next  
**[1:16:02-1:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:02):**  three, four years of operations for us is getting this first set of pipeline financed  and built.  But after that, we have more leads than we can possibly follow up on right now, much  
**[1:16:15-1:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:15):**  more than we have the capacity to execute on if we wanted to.  So expansion has the capacity to happen very quickly.  And I don't think a billion will be too much.  
**[1:16:29-1:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:29):**  Considering, I mean, I always ask last question and then I don't.  Considering what you know on what's possible, but also the state of the world, you've traveled  a lot.  
**[1:16:39-1:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:39):**  Are you hopeful?  Yeah.  This is a great question.  
**[1:16:47-1:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:16:47):**  As a species, historically, we are terrible at preventing disasters.  Right.  We've been a horrible keystone species and horrible at preventing disaster.  
**[1:17:01-1:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:01):**  But we in terms of species on Earth, nothing compares to us in terms of adaptability.  At least there are no other vertebrates that compare to us in terms of adaptability.  There's no other mammal that's figured out how to live in every major biome.  
**[1:17:22-1:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:22):**  Limet and biome.  We are very, very good at adapting and we can adapt very quickly.  And history shows that.  
**[1:17:30-1:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:30):**  So my hope, and this is something that our company is, our company is climate mitigation,  but it's also climate adaptation.  I am not hopeful that we will prevent many of the disasters that we have seen coming  
**[1:17:51-1:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:51):**  for a long time.  And look at the water situation right now.  Right.  
**[1:17:57-1:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:17:57):**  How we've known for decades that the Ogallala Aquifer in the central US was being depleted.  We haven't stopped depleting it.  But once it's gone, we're going to adapt.  
**[1:18:09-1:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:09):**  Right.  The Colorado River in the southwestern US, it's 15 million acre feet total.  In general, 15 million acre feet.  
**[1:18:18-1:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:18):**  All that 15 million acre feet is already accounted for.  Right.  That rot belongs to somebody.  
**[1:18:26-1:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:26):**  Demand for water within the Colorado watershed is expected to grow by another 15 million  acre feet in the next 25, 30 years or something.  Right.  
**[1:18:38-1:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:38):**  We don't have, demand is going to increase by another Colorado River.  There's only one Colorado River.  Right.  
**[1:18:44-1:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:44):**  And 40% of that river, between 30 and 40%, is going exclusively to alfalfa.  Right.  That is one of the stupidest things we can do with that water.  
**[1:18:54-1:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:18:54):**  But we're still doing it.  Right.  So are we, is it politically feasible that we're going to change how all this water is  
**[1:19:03-1:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:03):**  used across a Byzantine system of laws?  No.  The water is going to run out.  
**[1:19:08-1:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:08):**  It's going to force adaptation.  And then we're going to adapt.  We're really good at adapting.  
**[1:19:12-1:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:12):**  Then we're going to build a lot of mangroves to bring back the rain.  Yeah.  I mean, it's-  
**[1:19:17-1:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:17):**  But not enough to build two Colorado rivers.  So does that make me an optimist or a pessimist where I say, yeah, we're good at adapting  and we're going to figure it out, but we're not going to prevent these disasters from  
**[1:19:29-1:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:29):**  happening?  I don't know what that makes me.  I don't know either, but it just came up as, I don't know, I had to think about the question  
**[1:19:38-1:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:38):**  as a good final one to, I wouldn't say summarize, but just to have a look inside your thoughts.  I will say that I am a lot happier as a person working on solutions.  I am not prone to despair or climate despair.  
**[1:19:59-1:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:19:59):**  I get sad about things, right?  Like they just said that the Chinese manatee is now functionally extinct.  They don't think it's anywhere.  
**[1:20:08-1:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:08):**  That breaks my heart.  It does.  It's really sad.  
**[1:20:15-1:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:15):**  But the fact that we're working on solutions that address biodiversity and carbon and local  economies and food and water, like I feel a great deal of satisfaction working on the  stuff I'm working on.  
**[1:20:33-1:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:33):**  And I'm confident we're going to be able to roll this out and make a difference.  So, and let me close with one more thing.  What underpins the regenerative movement is a kind of faith that humans can be a keystone  
**[1:20:55-1:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:20:55):**  species, right?  Now that is proven if we look at some indigenous societies, not all indigenous societies, but  some indigenous societies have had systems that lasted for tens of thousands of years  
**[1:21:09-1:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:09):**  sustainably, right?  And now it's what?  It's 5% of human population is indigenous and they're stewarding 80% of the biodiversity.  
**[1:21:20-1:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:20):**  They are the example that humans can be a keystone species.  They're the proof of it.  And I don't want to engage in the noble savage stereotype.  
**[1:21:34-1:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:34):**  I don't, indigenous people are just people.  They have a set of cultures and rules and practices that have allowed them to foster  biodiversity and be stewards of the earth.  
**[1:21:46-1:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:46):**  That's what all of us should be.  At the same time, we're all indigenous to earth.  All of us.  
**[1:21:55-1:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:21:55):**  We belong on this planet and our role is to be a keystone species.  And that idea underpins the whole regenerative movement.  And for me, some of the most sublime experiences I have ever had was seeing birds build nests  
**[1:22:16-1:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:22:16):**  in trees that I grew in a place where people told me trees aren't supposed to grow.  Seeing bees swarm on a site where people said, we haven't seen bees here for 40 years.  And to know that our work facilitated that.  
**[1:22:40-1:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:22:40):**  I didn't go and trap bees and bring them over.  I created the microclimate and facilitated a way for nature to come back.  And all of us can do that on a tiny or large scale.  
**[1:22:59-1:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:22:59):**  But what that did to me internally was quite profound.  And one of the things that I think regenerative resources will do is allow people to participate  in that somewhat by proxy.  
**[1:23:19-1:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:23:19):**  But I think if more of us had that kind of experience, it would bode well for us and  for every other species on this planet.  And that to me is the personal underpinning of why I'm part of the regenerative movement.  
**[1:23:36-1:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:23:36):**  And with that, I think it's a perfect end to this conversation.  I don't think it's the last time.  I hope it's not the last time we connect.  
**[1:23:44-1:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:23:44):**  I want to thank you so much for the work you do.  Thank you for showing up here and sharing.  And of course, we wish you good luck with the investor meeting that follows right after  
**[1:23:53-1:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:23:53):**  my conversation.  That's right.  It's in two minutes.  
**[1:24:02-1:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:24:02):**  Thank you so much for listening all the way to the end.  For the show notes and links discussed, check out our website investinginregenerativeagriculture.com  forward slash post.

**[1:24:22-1:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:24:22):**  If you liked this episode, why not share it with a friend or give us a rating on Apple  Podcast.  That really helps.  
**[1:24:28-1:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:24:28):**  Thanks again and see you next time.  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:24:49-1:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:24:49):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:24:59-1:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:24:59):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:25:11-1:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:11):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[1:25:18-1:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:18):**  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  
**[1:25:22-1:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:22):**  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  
**[1:25:27-1:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:27):**  For whom is this course?  You, the soil builders and investors in the space.  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[1:25:36-1:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:36):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management, consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[1:25:48-1:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:25:48):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[1:26:01-1:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:01):**  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:26:05-1:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:05):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  
**[1:26:15-1:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:15):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[1:26:24-1:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:24):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to write along.  
**[1:26:33-1:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:33):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[1:26:48-1:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:48):**  find if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:26:59-1:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:26:59):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:27:06-1:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:27:06):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:27:15-1:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/neal-spackman#t=1:27:15):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:14):**  Big funds are being raised but they all quote on quote complain about the missing deal flow.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:18):**  So we need more project developers.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:20):**  In some sectors this is a dirty word but here we need people who are disciplined, who put  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:24):**  together the business plan, organize the permits, figure out the seeds or tree genetics, figure  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:29):**  out the irrigation equipment, organize the offtake agreements and while it always gets  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:34):**  delayed, don't take any salary or a very low one for a couple of years.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:38):**  All of this to create bankable investable projects.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:41):**  So the investors who are usually far away and have never seen an almond orchard or a  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:45):**  permanent pasture weed system get comfortable and convince their investment committees and  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:50):**  their bank colleagues to give the green light.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:52):**  So farm after farm, hectare after hectare can start with the implementation of regenerative  
**[0:00:57-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:57):**  practices.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:00:58):**  Might not be sexy but it's absolutely crucial.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:01:01):**  So enjoy this interview with one of those project developers in France.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:01:08):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:01:13):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:17-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:01:17):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:01:23):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:01:27):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:01:30):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:01:33):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:01:38):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:01:42):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:02:13):**  Welcome to another episode today with Boris Petsky, the founder or one of the co-founders  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:02:17):**  of Green Pots with a long history in regenerative agriculture, sustainable agriculture finance.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:02:23):**  Very happy to have him on the show.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:02:25):**  We've known each other for a while and it's finally time to have Boris on the show.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:02:29):**  So welcome.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:02:30):**  All right.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:02:31):**  Thank you very much for having me.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:02:33):**  And to start with a personal question, what brought you to this space of, I mean, from  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:02:39):**  all the different career paths you could have taken in a comfortable office somewhere with  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:02:44):**  a lot of air conditioning and to be very comfortable instead of out in the field planting trees,  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:02:49):**  financing trees and trying to get this done.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:02:51):**  What led you to this sector?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:02:53):**  I was basically given the opportunity to work into agriculture by a friend who was working  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:02:59):**  for a commodity merchant.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:03:03):**  And he told me about a cocoa guy he had met while he was doing his internship on a flour  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:03:10):**  mill in Cameroon.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:03:11):**  And I applied to E-Com.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:03:14):**  This was back in 2007 to a large commodity merchant.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:03:19):**  And I applied to join their Central Asia desk.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:03:21):**  I'd been studying Central Asian and Caucasian studies at St. Petersburg State University  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:03:27):**  and decided that I maybe could join work and personal interests.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:03:31):**  So basically, I already have 15 years of experience in agriculture, we could call agribusiness.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:03:39):**  It's a mix between value chain finance and public-private partnerships.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:03:42):**  And I worked on three different continents.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:03:44):**  So I started as a merchant originating cotton in Uzbekistan, shipping 50,000 tons of cotton  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:03:52):**  a year through the port of Bandar Abbas in Iran, shipping mostly to textile mills in  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:03:59):**  Bangladesh.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:04:00):**  And given the difficult context back in the days, political context in Uzbekistan, I quickly  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:04:06):**  moved to Tajikistan, where we were invited at the initiative of the Better Cotton Initiative,  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:04:11):**  which was maybe a kind of burgeoning concept of region ag, to replicate the coffee model  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:04:18):**  of a group that prides itself in having more agronomists than the merchants on the payroll.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:04:23):**  So basically, provide technical assistance to farmers, increase their yields, increase  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:04:29):**  their revenues, and become their preferred off-taker.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:04:34):**  This is where I...  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:04:35):**  So I didn't come from the soil.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:04:38):**  I came more from the economic...  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:04:40):**  We all do, right, and we all go back.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:04:42):**  Yeah, and I came more from the social aspect because back in the days, Tajikistan, the  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:04:47):**  farmers were very much in debt after the fall of the Soviet Union, a civil war that followed.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:04:53):**  And I think their debt, aggregated debt, was $400 million to cotton genius, to intermediaries.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:05:01):**  And basically, these guys were pre-financing the farmers in kind with poor fertilizer,  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:05:07):**  diesel that was cut with water, seeds were given late, and of course, with a 30% or even  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:05:13):**  more predatory interest rates.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:05:15):**  So the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development came in, refinanced the farmers  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:05:19):**  at decent interest rates through the banks, and they asked that someone actually buys  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:05:26):**  the cotton at the farm gate to make sure that the credit cycle was being closed.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:05:32):**  So that's how I started, got acquainted with agriculture.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:05:34):**  We had lots of agronomists helping the farmers.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:05:37):**  Then moved to Mexico in 2011, did two years in a soluble coffee plant, then did another  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:05:46):**  three years or more in the former Soviet Union in Moscow to sell cocoa products.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:05:51):**  And then 2015 or 2014, actually, the war started and Russia invaded Crimea.  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:05:58):**  We came back to Europe.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:05:59):**  I did my MBA.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:06:00):**  And this was the emergence of...  
**[0:06:05-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:06:05):**  There was demand from investors to invest into kind of sustainable land management and  
**[0:06:17-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:06:17):**  agriculture.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:06:18):**  So you had different funds.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:06:19):**  You had the initiative of Danone with livelihood.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:06:22):**  You had the Clemence Cheneau with Moringa who interviewed.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:06:25):**  And the UNNCC was starting the Land Degradation Neutrality Fund.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:06:31):**  So basically, they had been given a mandate by one of the three conventions, the United  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:06:36):**  Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, to basically launch and structure a fund that  
**[0:06:43-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:06:43):**  would invest into sustainable land management and revert the trends of land degradation.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:06:50):**  So these were really five interesting years.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:06:53):**  I became the investment director for Latin America.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:06:58):**  We did some deals in Nicaragua, in Peru, in Colombia.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:07:06):**  Did other deals in Bhutan as well, mostly tree crops.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:07:09):**  And this is where basically, I think, a lot was learned.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:07:15):**  The UNNCC provided us with a very robust scientific framework and basically, you started having  
**[0:07:24-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:07:24):**  an interesting consensus between civil society, between academia on how to kind of restore  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:07:32):**  lands and between restoration, regeneration.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:07:35):**  Well, I think then, let's not play on words, but it's quite similar.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:07:40):**  So this is how I came basically to setting up Greenplots because after five years, we  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:07:47):**  saw that there was maybe more...  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:07:49):**  Not enough deal flow, more money wanting to flow to RegenAg than actual developers and  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:07:54):**  with an operating background.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:07:56):**  And it's especially a matter of personal taste.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:07:59):**  I felt more compelled to go back to operations than stay as a financier, which are...  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:08:06):**  Financiers are useful people, they're the pump of the economy, but it depends on what  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:08:11):**  you think you're best at or maybe not even what you're best at, but what you like most.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:08:17):**  And it was definitely finding land, finding the right irrigation equipment, the right  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:08:25):**  genetics.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:08:26):**  So, yeah, that's how I...  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:08:28):**  You say something super interesting there on the developing side.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:08:32):**  You say there's more money that wants to flow than projects, investable projects to flow  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:08:38):**  into.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:08:40):**  And you happen to really like that development piece, which I think is a very under spotlighted  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:08:46):**  role in this sector.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:08:48):**  We've seen it in renewable energies where the developers have been always the crucial  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:08:52):**  piece to put all the different puzzle pieces together and then the money will flow.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:08:56):**  And of course, some people had to take early risk and now 20 years later or 30 years later,  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:00):**  whatever timeframe you look at, that sector exists.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:04):**  But it seems to be almost in the region ag and agroforestry space that developer role  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:10):**  hasn't really been filled yet.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:13):**  And we see it sort of emerging.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:14):**  I see multiple people starting to take that role.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:17):**  And what really...  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:18):**  Because maybe for people to understand, what is that role?  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:21):**  I mean, you're saying from figuring out irrigation equipment down to the genetics and buying  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:25):**  and figuring out the land.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:27):**  To describe that first project in France that you've been on the way now, like what is it  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:33):**  like?  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:34):**  Let's make it as visual as possible because we're on an audio tour, obviously.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:37):**  And then let's unpack a bit what it takes to put something like that together and get  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:41):**  it financed.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:42):**  Because of course, we can make a great PowerPoint, but if we don't get it financed, nothing will  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:47):**  be in the ground.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:48):**  Maybe we'll get back exactly.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:50):**  This is a very interesting point that ag has never been structured like renewable energy  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:55):**  where at some point 20 years ago, you had product developers come to finance.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:09:59):**  They said, look, I've put a data room together.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:01):**  I've got the permits.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:02):**  I know it will work.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:03):**  I've got the technology.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:05):**  And it's not going to be caused project finance.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:07):**  I've got no money, but I want to stay as a majority shareholder and please finance us  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:11):**  with kind of long-term and patient capital to make sure that we go through the J-curve.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:16):**  And this is completely something...  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:19):**  Project finance, the rules could be applied to ag.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:21):**  So this is what we tried to do at LaGrangea, which is Green Pots first project.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:30):**  We kind of...  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:31):**  Actually, under the team that has set up Green Pots, we all did a stint with the LDN fund.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:37):**  So Green Pots is a fully integrated region ag farm developer, specializing in tree nuts  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:43):**  and servicing the growing demand for plant-based products, providing full traceability back  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:48):**  to the farm.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:49):**  So the first farm LaGrangea, close to Toulouse, is France's largest organic almond orchard.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:10:56):**  And we got certified with the French label by Carbone in January with an estimated 4,500  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:01):**  tons.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:02):**  So that's the farm.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:05):**  The context was the following.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:07):**  So as you know, agriculture is a major cause of climate change with being responsible for  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:12):**  roughly 25% of greenhouse gas emissions.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:16):**  We have 1.3 billion hectares available to feed the world population.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:19):**  We degrade 12 million hectares a year through deforestation, intensive monocropping, and  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:23):**  overgrazing.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:24):**  And if you look at France, in France alone, we import 4.5 million tons of soy every year.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:31):**  It's mostly GM in the sense that it comes from the Americas or South America.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:37):**  And the same goes for almonds.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:39):**  Nothing to do with GM this time, but we have a consumption of 40,000 tons and we produce  
**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:44):**  less than a thousand.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:45):**  So the system-  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:46):**  Because it's not the ideal climate or because it's not possible or it's possible, it just  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:51):**  hasn't been on a scale.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:53):**  We did have a larger almond production back in the days, but it's just that sometimes  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:11:59):**  you shift and we've got a lot of land where it could grow, which is allocated to different  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:03):**  things.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:04):**  You're in the south of France, you see some huge maize fields, and I don't think that's  
**[0:12:07-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:07):**  the most appropriate crop to plant in this area and in Provence.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:14):**  You've got some higher value added crops.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:17):**  So the system won't work any longer.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:20):**  One we must switch to more plant-based diets and eat more local to leave pressure on land.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:25):**  That's on the-  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:26):**  And not grow maize, so then it's going to be fed to livestock.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:30):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:31):**  And that's on the demand side.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:34):**  And on the supply side, we must transition our agricultural production towards reg and  
**[0:12:39-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:39):**  ag.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:40):**  Less pesticide and fertilizer use, less water use, more biodiversity and better farm incomes.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:47):**  This is, I think, the broader accepted definition that's been already kind of carved into stone  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:52):**  by OP2B.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:53):**  So Lagrange-  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:12:54):**  Which I know people are listening, we haven't had them on the show.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:00):**  OP2B is the Biodiversity Alliance, if I have to.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:04):**  I'll put a link below in the show notes of large, basically all the large food producers  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:11):**  in the world around biodiversity.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:13):**  I think it was launched by the then CEO of Danone, Faber.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:16):**  Exactly.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:17):**  It was Emmanuel Faber, and they had put these videos together with Patagonia.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:21):**  And I think, can we date maybe, at least in France, we always spoke about agroecology,  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:26):**  so maybe the sustainable intensification of agricultural production.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:31):**  It was not really a fight, but at some point when you've got a company like Patagonia and  
**[0:13:36-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:36):**  the kind of marketing genius coming with a term like reg and ag and making it spread,  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:46):**  I think-  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:47):**  Sexy, yeah.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:48):**  Reg and ag has taken over, and I think in terms of marketing, in terms of message, it's  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:55):**  efficient.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:13:56):**  And let's talk about the farm then as what is fundamentally different.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:14:01):**  Of course, let's talk about the maize field it replaces.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:14:04):**  Of course, it's a very different view or very different image.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:14:07):**  It's very different food and not feed, but also compared to a non-organic or a non-organic  
**[0:14:12-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:14:12):**  regenerative almond production, what are the differences we could recognize?  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:14:20):**  What would we see differently under your trees, with your trees, around your trees compared  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:14:24):**  to a non-organic one where most of it probably comes from now imported to France?  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:14:29):**  I think it's important to discuss the baseline as in a carbon product.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:14:34):**  So two years ago during lockdown, we came across a farm for sale in Toulouse that had  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:14:38):**  been producing conventional corn for 30 years, exporting it to Spain's pork industry.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:14:44):**  So this French corn was fed to pigs in fattening stations.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:14:49):**  These pigs were sent to slaughterhouses and then packed and basically shipped back to  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:14:54):**  the French supermarket shelves.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:14:55):**  It's a bit crazy, far from what you would think of as a definition of sustainability.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:15:03):**  It's a bit of agro-economic nonsense.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:15:05):**  Actually, it gives the baseline of a product even in carbon terms.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:15:10):**  So we couldn't buy the farm.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:15:14):**  We managed to secure the farm through a 25-year lease and it was bought by an insurance company  
**[0:15:18-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:15:18):**  called La Maif in France that had a fund dedicated to basically helping young people settle on  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:15:25):**  land and they had identified the land purchase as really a barrier to entry.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:15:31):**  Which it is.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:15:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:15:33):**  Yeah, it is because we didn't have 2 million euros, that's for sure.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:15:38):**  So basically, we went from that really flat piece of land that had been basically depleting  
**[0:15:46-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:15:46):**  the soil resources for 30 years and we converted it to first, we entered in April 2021 and  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:15:54):**  we started rotating crops again.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:15:56):**  We planted buckwheat, soy and sunflower.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:16:01):**  And then we had winter crops and we planted oats, spelt, winter wheat and others.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:16:08):**  So already you try to regain a bit of life.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:16:11):**  You did that to have these cash crops or you did it to build up soil life and to prep for  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:16:16):**  the trees?  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:16:17):**  No, we did it because first of all, it was not the purpose just to sit back.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:16:21):**  And of course, out of the 150 hectares, we plan to have 70 hectares of almonds.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:16:31):**  So I would call this farm more of a tree crop player.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:16:38):**  That's what we concentrate on.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:16:39):**  That's what we know.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:16:41):**  And once you reduce your acreage to 70 hectares of annual crops, it's not really worth buying  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:16:47):**  the equipment.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:16:48):**  So you're giving it to a service provider.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:16:52):**  Of course, then the margins get eaten.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:16:55):**  And first of all, on annual crops, if you don't process yourself or integrate downstream  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:17:00):**  operations, it's not extremely profitable.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:17:04):**  The point is more to get it at break-even.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:17:08):**  And as well, as you know, for Regen Ag certification, ROC certification, which we're aiming for  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:17:13):**  Regen Organic certification, you need to rotate several crops.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:17:17):**  So of course, we got that lease for 25 years.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:17:24):**  But one condition of the lease was you convert to organic at year one.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:17:29):**  So that's what we did.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:17:31):**  And once you've got 30 years of intensive monocropping and we came in late, so we planted  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:17:37):**  in spring while we had to basically we're competing with the weeds.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:17:42):**  And it's been very difficult.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:17:45):**  We lost money.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:17:46):**  We had to compete with Datura and Xanthium, which are toxic.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:17:51):**  And our soy got contaminated and was declassed from some tons.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:17:57):**  I had to go for animal feed and we're not fit for human consumption.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:18:01):**  So the transition, it's true, has a cost because if you kind of treat chemically for 30 years,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:18:13):**  the day you stop applying chemicals, it's party time for your weeds.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:18:19):**  And we should have maybe planted winter crops before because this year, for example, we  
**[0:18:24-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:18:24):**  planted wheat and it doesn't germinate at the same time and there's been no competition  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:18:31):**  and the wheat is perfect.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:18:33):**  So we're now in conversion takes three years in France.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:18:36):**  We call it C1, C2, C3.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:18:39):**  We're in C2, year C2, and next year we can start selling the organic...  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:18:47):**  We can start selling our annual crops as organic to the crop.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:18:51):**  And so this is the annual crop part.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:18:56):**  And on the 24th of February this year, we planted the first 32 hectares of the orchard.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:05):**  We've been working on this product for the past two years with basically good friends,  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:09):**  good Spanish friends, and you know them.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:11):**  It's Cristobal Aranaga, who runs the nursery Crisara, who used to be the president of Al  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:16):**  Velar for a couple of years.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:18):**  They came to the farm several times.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:20):**  Just as a background, I don't know him personally, but we've had common land, we've had a Spanish  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:25):**  project a number of times on it.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:27):**  I will link below some interviews.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:28):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:29):**  So this is the man who runs the nursery, which has provided many plants to the common land  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:36):**  project.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:37):**  So they were quite interested to try to adapt their almond trees, which grow in the kind  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:44):**  of Altiplano in Andalusia, and see how they adapt with the climate frontier moving north.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:50):**  Why did you take their genetics?  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:54):**  Is that a risk taking genetics from such a different climate or you're sort of calculating  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:19:59):**  that you might be in a similar climate or there was simply the best genetics around?  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:02):**  No, we're not in a similar climate.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:04):**  But what was the reasoning going for their genetics?  
**[0:20:08-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:08):**  No, they have many different varieties.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:11):**  You've got blooming calendars produced by different research centers in Spain.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:16):**  You've got IRTA in Catalonia, you've got SEBAS in Murcia.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:20):**  And what we planted was, of course, late blooming varieties because as you've seen in the past  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:26):**  two years in France, we had terrible late frosts.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:31):**  And we've taken varieties, we've planted varieties that bloom in April.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:35):**  And in April already in Toulouse, the frost risk is much more reduced than in March.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:42):**  So and plus it's mitigated.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:43):**  They're much further south, but they're at a higher altitude.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:48):**  And even Castilla Mancha this year, Castilla Mancha is right in the center of Spain.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:53):**  But the altitude is much higher, 600 meters.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:55):**  And they suffered from late frost this year as well.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:20:59):**  So we're a couple months in now.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:01):**  How is it difficult to say something, obviously, but how have the trees been?  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:07):**  The trees have behaved quite well.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:08):**  We've got a very high germination rate.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:12):**  A few losses, we're still counting the losses.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:15):**  And the nursery, if the nursery helps you plant, normally you have a contract with nursery  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:19):**  where they guarantee 100 germination of the plants.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:23):**  They would call it a premier feuille first leaf.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:25):**  Then if it gets eaten by animals, of course, they won't replace them.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:28):**  It's a different story.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:31):**  So now that they're doing well, the growth is good.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:36):**  And we've planted, we're lucky to have the MAIF help us with the structure of the project.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:45):**  We have some passes were quite, had a high clay content.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:51):**  And we've had to drain some of them.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:53):**  This was taken care of by the MAIF.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:21:56):**  And we've started with the most suitable areas, which are in Spanish, Franco Arenoso, which  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:02):**  is quite sandy soils.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:05):**  Because there's one thing that almond trees hate is really being swimming in water, having  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:11):**  the root system wet in water so you get root asphyxia.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:16):**  So you want to make sure that water flows.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:19):**  And if you have drains, you're safe.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:21):**  So now the trees, what you do, you plant them.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:24):**  They come at a height of 1 meter 20.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:28):**  That's what's guaranteed.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:30):**  And then you have your first formation pruning.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:33):**  You prune them back to 90 centimeters.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:36):**  You plant them with a tutor.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:38):**  You put a protector against rodents.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:41):**  And here you go.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:42):**  And then what kind of prep have you done?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:45):**  What kind of soil prep?  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:48):**  What did you do to make sure that you have the highest chance of long term success?  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:54):**  After 30 years of intense work.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:22:57):**  There was a competition soil 80 centimeters below ground.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:02):**  So what you have to do is take what we call in French, the repeal.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:05):**  You have to plow, you have to go for a deep plow.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:09):**  And then kind of, so you have to start tilling.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:13):**  You till once, but big time.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:15):**  And then it's going to be with cover crops.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:19):**  So at some point, it won't be touched anymore.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:23):**  You do that once.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:24):**  You kind of break that soil so you let the root system go deeper.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:30):**  And then you kind of clean it with your machinery.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:36):**  And then it becomes your orchard.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:38):**  That's it.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:40):**  And what are the other, let's say, management practices you're putting in place?  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:43):**  You mentioned cover crops.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:45):**  Are you going to do any grazing?  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:47):**  What's going to happen in between the lines?  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:49):**  How close are they?  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:50):**  What are you looking at?  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:52):**  We're not there yet because frankly speaking, we're in an area which is slightly more humid  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:57):**  than the rest.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:23:58):**  But frankly, farming organically in an area which is less dry will have, I think, a few  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:04):**  more treatments to anticipate possible fungus or use copper.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:09):**  You get to use, what, four kilos a year max per hectare.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:12):**  That's the rule in France.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:14):**  So we're not there yet.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:16):**  We've discussed that we're going to, of course, put some beehives three to four per hectare  
**[0:24:20-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:20):**  because although we have self-pollinating, or I call them auto fertile varieties, you  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:29):**  do increase your yields by putting beehives.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:32):**  It makes it better.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:34):**  And I think there's only one species of sheep that doesn't eat your trees.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:40):**  It's the Shropshire sheep.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:42):**  But we won't test it this year.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:45):**  We'll have to wait a bit.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:46):**  And they're bigger and safer.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:48):**  You cannot do, unless it's a demonstration plot, you cannot do everything.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:53):**  No, no, no, no.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:54):**  But like long term, how would you like to see the orchard develop?  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:24:58):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:25:00):**  Long term, we want to keep it as a pure organic orchard with basically we've planted lots  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:25:10):**  of hedges because it was completely flat and we got a grant from the Caisse de Dépôt  
**[0:25:15-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:25:15):**  to plant hedges and maybe one hectare as well of, how can we call it, a climate adaptation  
**[0:25:24-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:25:24):**  research orchard, a pilot orchard to take some different varieties from Spain and compare  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:25:31):**  the flowering blooming calendars with valleys that are further south and see how it evolves.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:25:38):**  But no, I think the reality is going to be quite classic, full cover crops, which gives  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:25:47):**  you the highest score in carbon, hedges or what you call them multifunctional hedges.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:25:53):**  So sometimes it's good for auxiliaries and yeah, quite simple.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:26:00):**  So we would like to farm some in between, maybe lavender, but today we still have to  
**[0:26:11-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:26:11):**  control the old weeds from the previous user.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:26:19):**  And how did you structure it as an investment or how did you structure it?  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:26:23):**  Because you didn't buy the land, as you mentioned before, but then all this planting obviously  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:26:27):**  comes at a cost.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:26:29):**  So as a developer, how did you structure this and how easy or difficult was it to find the  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:26:34):**  money to get it into the ground basically?  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:26:38):**  It's taken time and I've always been maybe back to what we saw.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:26:43):**  I always thought that in agriculture, especially tree crops where there's a pretty long and  
**[0:26:48-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:26:48):**  deep jake, you need to be disciplined and not pay yourself.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:26:51):**  In France, we've got a system which is called Macron d'Emission en Coversion.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:26:55):**  So I resigned from the UN-backed fund and had two years of a kind of reduced salary  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:27:00):**  paid to launch my venture.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:27:03):**  And we raised roughly 1 million in equity because it looks like it's a very good idea  
**[0:27:10-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:27:10):**  on paper that you have someone else buy the land for you and leave it to you.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:27:17):**  But once you go see the bank, the bank has no collateral.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:27:21):**  So they say, okay, it's good that you're starting and that someone has bought the land for you,  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:27:26):**  but what can you put as collateral against that loan?  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:27:30):**  So basically, capex is quite high in tree crops.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:27:33):**  It's between 10,000 to 15,000 euros per hectare.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:27:36):**  So it quickly becomes a 2 million, 3 million euro project.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:27:42):**  So 1 million in equity, we just got 1 million in debt from a syndicate of French banks made  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:27:49):**  of Cadillac Ecole and Banque Populaire.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:27:52):**  But because they did not know almond trees really well, it's more in Provence, in Toulouse,  
**[0:27:59-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:27:59):**  we think we're the newbies.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:02):**  So they thought that the risk was too important.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:04):**  So they made sure that they could apply bank guarantees from the European Investment Fund,  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:09):**  from the European Investment Bank to basically secure the loan.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:15):**  So they've got 80% first loss.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:17):**  It's called Guarantee Enough in France.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:21):**  It's a program.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:22):**  So banks basically apply to the European Investment Fund and they apply guarantees on the back  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:27):**  of the loans they did.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:28):**  So they don't take any risk basically?  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:31):**  No.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:32):**  Very little, very little.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:34):**  Not because Martin, my co-founder and I, we are 20% second loss guarantors.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:41):**  So for them, they finance innovation, but they didn't want to kind of take such high  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:52):**  risk.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:53):**  And they asked us, that's good for the carbon additionality.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:28:56):**  They asked us to basically put the carbon, not ask collateral, but they said that we  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:03):**  needed to do the carbon project and kind of submit our carbon application to the French  
**[0:29:09-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:09):**  government to get certified.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:12):**  So we did it.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:13):**  And then carbon certification is crucial for the numbers?  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:17):**  Is that quite developed in France?  
**[0:29:19-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:19):**  No.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:20):**  We have an estimated 4,500 tons of CO2 emission reduction.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:27):**  And at the price today, I think in France, you can sell the label by carbon for roughly  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:31):**  50 euros a ton.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:33):**  So that's 200K, and so that's 10% of your capex and opex until you reach your kind of  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:41):**  cash flow positive.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:42):**  So it's not even a cherry on the cake, but it makes it look good.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:46):**  And it shows that we've made the effort to submit.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:49):**  We've been good schoolboys with the French ministry.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:53):**  And how do you see this develop?  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:29:57):**  I think if developers are listening from the renewable energy space, they will recognize  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:30:01):**  if they've been around 30 years ago or 20 years ago.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:30:04):**  But how do you see this going?  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:30:06):**  This was the first one, which is always the most difficult, not only from the economic  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:30:09):**  perspective, but also from the finance perspective.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:30:12):**  How would you see a second or third these projects?  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:30:15):**  How would they ideally be financed or structured?  
**[0:30:19-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:30:19):**  I believe you need to take advantage of long term debts when it exists and of cheap debts.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:30:27):**  This has been the market conditions for the past few years.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:30:31):**  I've got no clue if these conditions will prevail in the future.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:30:35):**  So that's the problem.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:30:39):**  But again, back to some people you had on the podcast, I think you really need to talk  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:30:46):**  to investors who have in mind that you need patient capital.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:30:52):**  It's not for VCs who want to invest into NFTs or the metaverse.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:30:56):**  I mean, it's a different ballgame, especially with free crops.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:31:00):**  Free crops, if you work well within two, three years, you're in cruising speed.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:31:05):**  Tree crops, you get your first harvest in almonds in a year.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:31:11):**  You get a symbolic harvest in a year, three, four, five, six, you're in cruising speed  
**[0:31:15-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:31:15):**  depending on your planting density.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:31:17):**  If it's walnuts, I think it's close to 10 years.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:31:20):**  Same with pistachios, hazelnuts, it's maybe close to almonds.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:31:27):**  It's quite classic.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:31:30):**  I think the gearing ratios are roughly 50-50.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:31:34):**  If you put one in equity, one in debt is fine.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:31:37):**  And once it's in cruising speed, why not have more debt on the operation?  
**[0:31:43-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:31:43):**  But you have to be very conservative and especially have people not pay themselves too much at  
**[0:31:50-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:31:50):**  the beginning.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:31:51):**  I think it's a rule for every entrepreneur.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:31:55):**  You have to bootstrap your company, but especially in agriculture, people, you have to be very  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:32:00):**  stingy to succeed.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:32:03):**  And so what does the next phase now look like?  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:32:07):**  Apart from obviously managing this farm, making sure that as many trees make it as possible  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:32:12):**  in the best possible shape, the cover crops get on the arrow one as well.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:32:17):**  You're looking at next projects or what is next in terms of the Green Pots initiative?  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:32:23):**  Because I'm imagining you didn't raise one million in equity for one farm in Toulouse.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:32:29):**  This is at SPV level.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:32:31):**  Maybe it was a bit too much, but at the beginning, that's how you can convince your investors,  
**[0:32:38-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:32:38):**  especially you can convince your banks, especially if you don't have the land to put an escalator.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:32:45):**  So no, I think now the idea is to scale, not to scale.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:32:53):**  We're not planning to build a unicorn.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:32:55):**  That's not the idea.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:32:58):**  So many people are going to stop listening now.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:33:00):**  No, I'm joking.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:33:01):**  The idea is really to reach a certain scale.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:33:04):**  I cannot tell you how big that scale is to get some interest and to be able to have bargaining  
**[0:33:12-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:33:12):**  power with maybe distributors or large retail players so they listen to you.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:33:20):**  Because when you're small, even 70 hectares looks big in France for an almond orchard,  
**[0:33:24-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:33:24):**  but it's gardening compared to what the Americans can do with a farm like a company like Pomona,  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:33:31):**  which has got 40,000 hectares under management.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:33:35):**  So I don't know, we'd like to maybe secure, it could be a lease, it could be a purchase,  
**[0:33:43-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:33:43):**  not the same structure then of course in financial terms, reach 500,000 hectares and plant it.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:33:51):**  And I think best is to have a portfolio.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:33:54):**  I like nuts because they're non-perishable.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:33:58):**  So it reminds me of my ears in coffee and cocoa.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:34:00):**  You can store them.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:34:01):**  I wouldn't be able to do fresh fruit because I think there's a certain anxiety after 24  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:34:08):**  hours, you know, that you've only got 24 more hours left before it runs.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:34:13):**  I'll stay away from this business.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:34:15):**  It's for really artists.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:34:18):**  And yeah, portfolio farms, the idea of Green Pots is to scale and build a portfolio of  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:34:23):**  farms in Europe to basically contribute to food security.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:34:29):**  Food security substitutes our production to imports.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:34:35):**  The statistics are crazy.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:34:36):**  If we enter that discussion, I think France has doubled its fruit and veg imports over  
**[0:34:42-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:34:42):**  the past 10 years.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:34:44):**  So it's really a lot.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:34:50):**  And are you scared of, I mean, scared you see climate change as a risk as long-term  
**[0:34:56-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:34:56):**  fruit trees or this case, the tree nuts, they take a while and they, it's not really easy  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:35:03):**  to move or possible.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:35:04):**  So what would you say, like if investors say, yeah, I mean, annuals, you can adjust quite  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:35:10):**  quickly at this case, you're sort of stuck for the next 20 years.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:35:14):**  How do you anticipate on the risk of climate change?  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:35:16):**  Toulouse just went through, I think 40 degrees last week for the first time ever.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:35:21):**  And so what's your answer when somebody raises that question?  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:35:26):**  Of course we've had it raised in more than one time.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:35:30):**  I think you need to have a certain water policy.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:35:33):**  You need to make sure that what you draw on the water reserves is sustainable in a sense  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:35:39):**  that you should not dig wells.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:35:43):**  You should draw on to basically surface waters, which are renewable.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:35:48):**  And today this is the case with the river basins of La Garone or even the Ebro River  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:35:56):**  in Northern Spain.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:35:57):**  You've got ample precipitation on the Pyrenees.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:36:00):**  There's rain, there's snow, you have snow melts, then it gets back into the rivers.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:36:05):**  And basically we get water from the Canal de San Martori, which dates back to Napoleon  
**[0:36:10-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:36:10):**  III because you had overflows during the meltdown from the Pyrenees in La Garone.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:36:17):**  And this was made to divert that overflow and bring it to roughly 30,000 hectares that  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:36:23):**  are being irrigated around the farm.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:36:26):**  So this is really important.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:36:28):**  That's why of course I wouldn't go today to the south or some people are going to Morocco.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:36:34):**  I think that's quite a risky bet.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:36:36):**  I think it's interesting to anticipate the climate frontier moving north a bit.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:36:43):**  Don't plant almonds in Scotland today, but there's certainly a trend.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:36:48):**  It's pretty hard to quantify.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:36:53):**  And yeah, I think again, blue water withdrawal is one of the criteria of the OPWB in the  
**[0:37:00-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:00):**  region ag definition.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:01):**  In the US, they use 12,000 cubic meters of water to irrigate one hectare of almonds.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:09):**  We've only got a limited...  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:13):**  We call it La Dotation.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:16):**  We get an allowance of 6,000 cubic meters per year.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:19):**  So you can already see that between the French approach and the American approach, you've  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:25):**  got a difference, which is basically mandatory.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:28):**  It's just regulatory.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:29):**  We see water use in a different manner.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:34):**  And in France, you cannot build...  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:36):**  It's impossible to build water storage units.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:41):**  You need to use what you get.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:44):**  And if there are water shortages, you can count on the head of region or sorry, the  
**[0:37:48-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:48):**  prefect.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:50):**  So it's at department level to put on some restrictions.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:37:54):**  And this year in Spain, some farms which had water rights up to 8,000 cubic meters have  
**[0:38:00-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:00):**  been restricted down to 1,750 cubic meters around the Gola Al Kivir river basin is close  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:07):**  to Sevilla.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:08):**  So this is really...  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:09):**  It's coming.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:10):**  Yeah, it's real.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:11):**  And for you, like the 6,000 in your calculations, of course, it's difficult to know now.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:15):**  Is that more?  
**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:16):**  Just to get an understanding, is that more than enough?  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:18):**  Is that way too much?  
**[0:38:19-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:19):**  Like you can easily make it...  
**[0:38:21-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:21):**  It's nice if it's there, but you can easily make it with way less.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:23):**  Like do you have that in this kind of system?  
**[0:38:26-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:26):**  Do you have the flexibility to...  
**[0:38:29-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:29):**  Let's say it gets half.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:30):**  Are you in deep trouble?  
**[0:38:31-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:31):**  There's a very good graph produced by the Catalonia Research Center with water use and  
**[0:38:39-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:39):**  yields when it comes to tree crops.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:42):**  The correlation is one to one and the more water you use, the better the yield.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:45):**  But at some point, there's a bit of a plateau in the sense that at 6,000 cubic meters, I  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:52):**  think you've got the optimal irrigation.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:38:55):**  If you apply 7 or 8, you're going to be wasting a lot of water, but you're not increasing  
**[0:39:00-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:39:00):**  the yields.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:39:01):**  It's just a marginal increase.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:39:04):**  So I think this is the right...  
**[0:39:07-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:39:07):**  It's our sweet spot.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:39:08):**  We can always discuss it maybe a bit less.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:39:11):**  And in case there's no more water one day, you have to think it.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:39:15):**  This is really the crash test.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:39:17):**  We've planted with densities of 6 by 3, so that's roughly 550 trees per hectare.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:39:25):**  If things go wrong, you can always take out one tree out of two in the row.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:39:31):**  You get back into 6 by 6 and 6 by 6 is very close to the classical Andalusia Spanish density,  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:39:39):**  which is kind of family farming with no irrigation whatsoever.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:39:44):**  Low input, low output, and that's what you get.  
**[0:39:49-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:39:49):**  So I think you need to have a kind of escape scenario where you get back to non-irrigated.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:00):**  I hope not.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:02):**  No, no, of course.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:04):**  But I mean...  
**[0:40:05-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:05):**  It's been asked, of course.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:06):**  Yeah, it's been asked and you need to at least be ready and hope that it never happens.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:12):**  But then you really get into a low yield system.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:16):**  You can reach yields of 1.5 tons in organic, even higher per hectare.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:21):**  But if you don't irrigate, it's a tree that alternates from year to year, bumper crop  
**[0:40:27-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:27):**  then low crop.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:29):**  And if you don't have irrigation, it gets even harder.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:36):**  So you could get yields down to 300 kilos, 400 kilos per hectare, so then you're not  
**[0:40:43-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:43):**  going to be touching it much.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:46):**  And then what are you planning in terms of yields?  
**[0:40:49-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:49):**  What are you modeling with?  
**[0:40:51-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:40:51):**  I think between 1.5 tons, it's very early to say, but you've got people who manage this  
**[0:41:03-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:03):**  quite well.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:04):**  I've seen Spaniards reach 2 tons per hectare in organic in 6x3.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:09):**  And today you see a method called the super high density production model, they call it  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:15):**  super intensive, where it basically hedges.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:18):**  It's like...  
**[0:41:19-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:19):**  And they go over it with a machine.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:21):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:22):**  And you can just harvest with a machine.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:26):**  This is a different model.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:27):**  And what we see that some people are already thinking that it might be a bit too extreme  
**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:32):**  in the sense that your organic yield curve goes down quite quickly.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:38):**  When you're farming traditionally, an orchard can last for 40 years.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:42):**  I think it lasts for 25 if you're doing semi intensive.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:44):**  But if you go super intensive, you might have a shorter lifespan for your orchard.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:54):**  Which is something that you can model in, like if it makes sense in that sense.  
**[0:41:57-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:57):**  And of course, it's extremely high input.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:41:59):**  We've had some discussions on here and I've had some other discussions.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:02):**  Shout out to Dimitri of the Regen Agroforestry podcast.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:06):**  I think what would be very interesting as well is to test that how can you make that  
**[0:42:09-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:09):**  as...  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:10):**  I wouldn't even say regenerative because that sort of suggests that it's a thing.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:14):**  But how can you apply as many as some of the world is moving to high intensive?  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:19):**  What would that look like if you take extreme biodiversity measures, soil health, etc?  
**[0:42:24-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:24):**  Would that be possible?  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:25):**  Because maybe the hatches only last 10 years or 15 years, but you can model that in.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:30):**  Would that even be possible to do it without all the chemical input that it currently needs  
**[0:42:35-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:35):**  and all the water it currently needs?  
**[0:42:37-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:37):**  What would that look like?  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:38):**  I don't know.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:39):**  I don't know if anybody did it yet.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:43):**  There are trials in super intensive inorganic and without irrigation.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:49):**  And I think it's...  
**[0:42:50-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:50):**  Let's see.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:52):**  From what I understand and from what I've seen and all the authors I have visited, I've  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:42:56):**  driven several thousand kilometers between France and Spain.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:43:01):**  The super intensive model works well under steroids.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:43:05):**  But if you switch it to organic, it gets confused and you don't get much.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:43:11):**  Because you've got all these...  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:43:12):**  Porta in Gerto, you've got all these rootstocks which are called nanizante, they're dwarfing  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:43:17):**  rootstocks.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:43:20):**  And they need to be pumped up so the tree grows.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:43:25):**  So you need a bigger root system to theoretically make that work.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:43:30):**  And then what is...  
**[0:43:31-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:43:31):**  When you're talking organically, you have less choices with fertilization.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:43:37):**  So you need more vigorous rootstocks on which you graft whatever variety you want.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:43:42):**  But today you've got two main rootstocks in Arnos, which are the GF677, which is a Prunus  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:43:49):**  and another, Garnem, where you have a bit more fungus in your soil.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:43:53):**  But the rootstocks for super intensive are totally different.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:43:59):**  This is much more the...  
**[0:44:01-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:01):**  From what I understand, it's much more about being the apprentice sorcerer than the classic  
**[0:44:05-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:05):**  rootstocks you have that are just being multiplied in every nursery that you can find.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:11):**  And the high intensive guys and girls are saying, yeah, we need to do this because of  
**[0:44:17-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:17):**  labor shortages.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:18):**  We need to automate.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:19):**  We need to be able to drive over it with a machine and harvest and et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:24):**  Is that a thing in the almond?  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:28):**  I know it's a thing in the olive space or some people call it a thing.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:32):**  Is the labor shortages...  
**[0:44:34-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:34):**  Is that something you're planning with?  
**[0:44:38-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:38):**  Is that an issue in the organic almond industry in France or not at all?  
**[0:44:44-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:44):**  It's true that you need to mechanize in order to be competitive because in Northern Europe,  
**[0:44:50-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:50):**  we are not the cheapest.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:53):**  Our friends in the South sometimes are cheaper.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:44:56):**  So yes, that's a constraint.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:00):**  And there is as well a constraint of scale or size is that tree crop machinery works  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:08):**  well if you want to make sure that you pay it back.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:13):**  You working with 50-hectare blocks economically makes sense.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:19):**  If you've only got 20, it's going to be hard to invest into all the machinery because if  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:23):**  you need to have a tractor that cost you 90,000 euros, you need a sprayer, then you need the  
**[0:45:28-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:28):**  harvesting machine.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:30):**  You can always adapt and do it the Soviet way as we call it, but you need a certain  
**[0:45:38-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:38):**  scale.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:39):**  You need scale.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:40):**  You need parcels that are not too small because if your tractor guy has to turn every 30 meters,  
**[0:45:48-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:48):**  you just go crazy.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:49):**  Plus you have to leave 8 meters on the sides to make sure that you have a comfortable space  
**[0:45:54-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:54):**  for a U-turn.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:55):**  So your parcels need to be of a certain size.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:45:59):**  And of course, a square is better than some kind of a crazy artistic parcel.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:05):**  Which many places are unfortunately.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:08):**  Totally.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:09):**  And so how do you see that?  
**[0:46:10-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:10):**  What do you see in the future of mechanization?  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:13):**  Is it going to be lighter and smaller and you don't need 8 meters anymore to turn?  
**[0:46:18-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:18):**  Are going to be, I mean everybody's talking about autonomous, robotics, etc.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:21):**  Do you see anything yet in the nut tree space or is that all pipe dream?  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:28):**  What you see is crazy.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:30):**  I've seen some Israeli starters that can harvest your apples with drones.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:34):**  I've seen it too.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:39):**  This is quite crazy.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:40):**  I don't know what cost it comes.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:42):**  But if there's one thing I would dream of is of course electric tractors.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:47):**  I think the technology is still not there yet or maybe it's just too expensive.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:53):**  Because that's coming.  
**[0:46:55-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:55):**  If you do your...  
**[0:46:56-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:56):**  Shout out to Michael Hertz.  
**[0:46:57-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:57):**  I will put one link.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:46:58):**  He has to come on the show soon.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:02):**  In the carbon calculation, the 190 liters or 200 liters of diesel per hectare that you  
**[0:47:07-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:07):**  burn every year, you can feel them in the carbon calculation.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:10):**  You would be much better off with an electric tractor.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:14):**  That's one thing.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:15):**  We have used...  
**[0:47:16-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:16):**  We've had some trials with Agrin Culture, which is a Toulouse-based startup.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:23):**  And they have robots to basically mow in between rows.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:26):**  We did a demo at the farm the other day.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:30):**  Still not enough autonomy.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:31):**  It's the same thing when it comes to electrics or they have a hybrid engine.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:36):**  Looking very good.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:37):**  And it's true that someone working...  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:39):**  There's so much work to do on a farm that just going back and forth to do the mowing  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:44):**  and the mulching of the weeds that grow crazy every two weeks.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:49):**  If we can send rockets to space, I really hope that we can have automated lawn mowers  
**[0:47:55-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:47:55):**  that have the farmer or the farm manager sleep in the morning or do something else.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:00):**  Because you've got your irrigation, you've always got a pump that goes wrong.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:07):**  The day we had the heat in Toulouse, of course, the SD card of the pumps went wrong.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:14):**  So you always get things to fix.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:18):**  So spending time...  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:20):**  Driving back and forth, more or less the same, kind of diesel tractor.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:24):**  Shooting CO2 in the sky while you're trying to capture CO2 with your tree crops.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:30):**  That's something I really hope we can get out of in the next five or 10 years.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:34):**  Plus the silence is good.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:37):**  You do get some for permaculture or horticulture.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:40):**  You get very nice French tractors called the Sabiagris.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:44):**  They look like the lunar rover.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:46):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:47):**  Yeah, and it says Nio.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:50):**  They're definitely coming.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:52):**  But the silence would be nice as well actually in the countryside.  
**[0:48:56-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:56):**  You might hear the birds and the insects.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:48:59):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:00):**  So not today.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:02):**  I think we're trying to be at the edge of technology.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:05):**  We're not a tech company.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:07):**  We're trying to just speak to the best and say, look, if you want to try your solution,  
**[0:49:11-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:11):**  please come to the farm.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:12):**  So Genesis Soil Health has done the baseline of our soils.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:17):**  So they've got different...  
**[0:49:18-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:18):**  They've got different...  
**[0:49:19-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:19):**  They've got different criteria they look at.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:23):**  So you've got your soil organic carbon, of course.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:27):**  You've got bacterial diversity.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:28):**  You've got oxygen availability, zinc contamination, chrome, cadmium, anything.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:36):**  And the baseline is quite bad.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:37):**  So we hope that with all the prunings of the trees that we'll do by not tilling, we hope  
**[0:49:44-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:44):**  that...  
**[0:49:45-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:45):**  No, we don't hope.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:46):**  We're pretty sure that we'll do much better than the baseline because we started really  
**[0:49:51-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:51):**  low.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:52):**  And you already mentioned one thing that might not be the crucial one.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:49:57):**  If you had a magic wand and you could change one thing overnight, so you had one wish that  
**[0:50:01-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:01):**  could go...  
**[0:50:02-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:02):**  That would change in food and agriculture, what would that be?  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:05):**  It could be anything from carbon tax to better taste to stop crazy imports to electric tractors.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:11):**  But you only can choose one thing.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:14):**  What would that be?  
**[0:50:15-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:15):**  Well, it's a hard question.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:19):**  I would ask people to relocate some of their disposable income to food.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:28):**  I'm not a communist.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:29):**  My family left the Soviet Union.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:31):**  But I think that people have forgotten that you've got lots of different ecosystem services  
**[0:50:39-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:39):**  provided by agriculture between water regulation, air regulation, CO2 capture.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:45):**  I can't remember these statistics.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:47):**  I don't have them.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:48):**  I think it's quite famous that in the 50s maybe the share of disposable income that  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:52):**  a household would put in his food was 30%.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:50:56):**  And now it's maybe less than 10% because most of it is real estate or other things.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:51:01):**  And food has got much more value in it than just feeding people.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:51:08):**  We've tried in France, you've got the loi Galim.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:51:11):**  We've tried to protect farmers to have some kind of cost plus based formula.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:51:17):**  So people are not allowed or retailers are allowed to buy at a price load and kind of  
**[0:51:23-0:51:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:51:23):**  production cost of the farmer.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:51:25):**  But I think this is one...  
**[0:51:28-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:51:28):**  Because the economy is crazy.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:51:29):**  You've got bubbles on the internet, on NFT, on marketplaces.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:51:36):**  And I still think as everybody says it, you need to see a farmer three times a day to  
**[0:51:42-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:51:42):**  feed yourself.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:51:43):**  So it is a socially important job that has to be valued.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:51:47):**  So I think I would campaign for giving more revenues to all people who farm.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:51:57):**  Because today I think it's in a modern country, sorry, in a developed economy, it's 2% of  
**[0:52:04-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:04):**  GDP agriculture, primary production, not agribusiness.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:08):**  And what goes with it?  
**[0:52:11-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:11):**  That's where the real money is, but the direct money going to farms and land is nothing.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:17):**  And primary production is not financed enough in the sense that for a continent like Africa,  
**[0:52:26-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:26):**  I think maybe 40% of the population is still rural, a bit less.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:30):**  25% of GDP or 30% of GDP comes from agriculture.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:35):**  And you've got less than 5% exposure to ag and banks portfolio.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:40):**  So this is where the money needs to flow.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:42):**  It's primary production.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:44):**  I think it's socially important.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:46):**  That's what the UN have told me.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:48):**  I didn't invent the statistics and it's vital.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:51):**  And it's useful.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:52):**  And we see with what's happening today in Ukraine.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:52:57):**  So what would you tell, let's say we're in a theater full of quote unquote smart investors,  
**[0:53:04-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:04):**  both investing their own money, working in the finance sector.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:06):**  I mean, you've met many of these in the past.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:09):**  What would you leave them with?  
**[0:53:11-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:11):**  We're on stage where we're hosting an evening and we're doing this in person, which I hope  
**[0:53:15-0:53:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:15):**  will happen at some point.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:16):**  What would you leave them with as a message?  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:18):**  Obviously not giving investment advice, but what would you like them to do or where to  
**[0:53:23-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:23):**  start looking and hopefully investing and putting money to work once they leave that  
**[0:53:27-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:27):**  theater?  
**[0:53:31-0:53:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:31):**  Divest from sectors which are not helping the planet for one thing.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:36):**  That's where you've already got a EU taxonomy.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:38):**  I think that they'll be under higher pressure.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:41):**  You've got some champions.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:42):**  You've got some very good impact investors.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:45):**  You got some good years, the investors.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:47):**  I wouldn't be able to quantify what their share of the market or of asset management  
**[0:53:51-0:53:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:51):**  is.  
**[0:53:52-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:53:52):**  I would guess still quite small and very biased again, because I've worked in agriculture  
**[0:54:00-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:00):**  all my life, but it's in this sector, invest money in this sector and especially in prime  
**[0:54:05-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:05):**  production because that's where it's needed.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:08):**  Maybe stop thinking of double or not triple digit returns, but don't expect paybacks in  
**[0:54:16-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:16):**  two years with super high yield because that's actually not the case.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:21):**  Although you can make good money, but don't.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:24):**  Just to be clear, you're not in this for charity.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:27):**  You're predicting and hopefully realizing good returns.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:29):**  You can make very good money.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:32):**  That's maybe not very European, but orchards are being traded by North American funds and  
**[0:54:38-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:38):**  they're very happy with their returns.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:42):**  What would you do if you are in charge of, let's say, a one billion euro investment fund  
**[0:54:46-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:46):**  tomorrow morning?  
**[0:54:47-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:47):**  What would you allocate it to?  
**[0:54:50-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:50):**  Not down to the euro, but what would you focus on?  
**[0:54:52-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:52):**  Would it be all nuts, tree crops?  
**[0:54:54-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:54):**  Would it be some percentage of experimental things, some technology?  
**[0:54:59-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:54:59):**  If you had the longest time horizon possible, what would you prioritize if you had to put  
**[0:55:05-0:55:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:05):**  one billion euros to work?  
**[0:55:08-0:55:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:08):**  First, I would choose a geography that I love, which is Central Asia.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:11):**  You've got Uzbekistan, you've got Tajikistan, you've got plenty of water in the Himalayas,  
**[0:55:15-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:15):**  two huge rivers flowing, which are called the Amu Darya and Sirdaria.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:20):**  With one billion and 50,000 euro capex, I think you could do what I'm missing these  
**[0:55:25-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:25):**  years, 200,000 or 20,000 hectares.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:28):**  You could do a lot.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:30):**  I would do orchards because back in the days, it was an intensive cotton monoculture that  
**[0:55:36-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:36):**  has ruined the ILC.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:39):**  That's my first impression.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:42):**  Buy land and build orchards.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:44):**  Well, no need to buy land.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:46):**  Land can stay with the government.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:48):**  I'm completely agnostic.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:49):**  I think land sometimes can be totally separated from the operating company.  
**[0:55:54-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:54):**  I think it's-  
**[0:55:55-0:55:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:55):**  Unless you have to talk to a bank, yeah.  
**[0:55:58-0:55:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:58):**  But you don't have to do it.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:55:59):**  In this case, you don't have to do that.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:00):**  Where's your collateral?  
**[0:56:01-0:56:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:01):**  In this case, you don't need it.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:05):**  No, and of course, we discussed investors.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:08):**  Back to your previous question, the layered fund structures that some funds have is very  
**[0:56:15-0:56:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:15):**  clever because if the public sector cannot subsidize everything, sometimes when they  
**[0:56:19-0:56:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:19):**  put 5 or 10% at the bottom of a cash flow waterfall and they are junior to all the rest  
**[0:56:25-0:56:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:25):**  of the investors, the investors are very happy to go into a new asset class, which they would  
**[0:56:31-0:56:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:31):**  not dare enter on their own.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:34):**  That's what big investors can do like the EIB or the World Bank.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:38):**  This is especially for a region like Central Asia where it's still perceived as very risky  
**[0:56:44-0:56:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:44):**  and it's much less risky than it was at the fall of the Soviet Union.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:49):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:50):**  Again, tree crops, not because it's green parts, just because I've worked in this space  
**[0:56:53-0:56:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:53):**  for many years, even before.  
**[0:56:57-0:57:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:56:57):**  We have forgotten we always insist in France on horticulture and permaculture, but tree  
**[0:57:02-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:57:02):**  crops, we've lost the makings as well.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:57:04):**  I think it was maybe 2.5% or 3% of our agricultural surface.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:57:11):**  We've lost, I think, one percentage point on this.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:57:15):**  Relicating these crops to Europe, they capture carbon.  
**[0:57:20-0:57:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:57:20):**  It's pretty easy to follow good practices because very quickly, you will stop tilling.  
**[0:57:25-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:57:25):**  You will make your soil better.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:57:28):**  You will bring back biodiversity because there's much more biodiversity in an orchard than  
**[0:57:33-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:57:33):**  in a cornfield.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:57:36):**  You contribute to the much needed shift towards plant-based diets instead of having soy feeding  
**[0:57:44-0:57:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:57:44):**  animals that are then fed to us.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:57:47):**  Or corn shipped to Spain to fed pigs.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:57:50):**  Yeah, or they ship our corn to Spain so they ship back pork to us.  
**[0:57:56-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:57:56):**  Something against pig farmers, but maybe in the future, we won't be able to keep doing  
**[0:58:03-0:58:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:03):**  this.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:04):**  What would you tell?  
**[0:58:05-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:05):**  I hear a lot of people reach out to, like, okay, I don't have a farming background, or  
**[0:58:11-0:58:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:11):**  I do and I have some experience now, and I want to get active in this space.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:14):**  It's very difficult to give career advice, obviously, but what would you tell them?  
**[0:58:18-0:58:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:18):**  Focus on tree crops, focus on the project development.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:21):**  What do you think, Fio, is the missing piece out there that is really missing in the region  
**[0:58:28-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:28):**  X space?  
**[0:58:29-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:29):**  I would say that practice is important.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:35):**  Before you launch yourself into a project, or it's tempting to leave your full-time job,  
**[0:58:39-0:58:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:39):**  it's always good to experiment and to do it.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:44):**  If you have some savings, just plant a hectare or two with a friend.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:47):**  That's how we started with Martin.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:48):**  We tried to plant pistachios at his uncle's farm.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:52):**  For some reasons, we decided to do something else.  
**[0:58:57-0:58:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:57):**  It's important to give it a proper try.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:58:59):**  You might not like it, you might love it, you might become very good at it.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:59:05):**  This was actually the point I had with Martin when we started.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:59:11):**  Many people were coming with concept notes with no background in farming.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:59:14):**  As an investor, of course, that's a red flag, immediate red flag.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:59:19):**  They say, okay, that's too ambitious, no track record.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:59:22):**  That's the first reaction of every investor.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:59:24):**  If you develop, albeit small, a pilot and that you can show a pilot that is clean, then  
**[0:59:31-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:59:31):**  replicating, okay, it's changing the scale of the business can change the nature, but  
**[0:59:39-0:59:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:59:39):**  I think it's a very good start.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:59:43):**  Planting a hectare of land somewhere with some friends you can do it.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:59:49):**  I think it's great advice.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:59:51):**  I might add this question as a regular question because it's something to...  
**[0:59:56-0:59:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:59:56):**  I think we need more energy and more people.  
**[0:59:58-0:59:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:59:58):**  We need more people on the land for sure.  
**[0:59:59-1:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=0:59:59):**  We need more people connected to the land and through agriculture.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:00:04):**  That's one of the best ways to do that.  
**[1:00:05-1:00:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:00:05):**  I want to be conscious of your time and thank you so much for sharing.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:00:10):**  I would say early in the journey of Green Pots, but obviously not early in your journey  
**[1:00:13-1:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:00:13):**  into tree crops, into agriculture, into finance.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:00:16):**  I'm looking forward to check in how it's been developing and where the next farms will be  
**[1:00:21-1:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:00:21):**  and how you're going to grow to 500 to 1,000 hectares, et cetera, and of course, grow a  
**[1:00:26-1:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:00:26):**  lot of tree nuts in the process.  
**[1:00:29-1:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:00:29):**  Sure.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:00:30):**  Thank you very much for having me and look forward to being in touch.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:00:36):**  See you soon then.

**[1:01:19-1:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:01:19):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:01:23-1:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:01:23):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:01:27-1:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:01:27):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:01:31):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:01:33-1:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:01:33):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:01:37-1:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:01:37):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[1:01:42-1:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:01:42):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:01:47):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:01:49-1:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:01:49):**  How have we built our decision making framework?

**[1:02:03-1:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:03):**  How to approach this space?  
**[1:02:06-1:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:06):**  For whom is this course?  
**[1:02:07-1:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:07):**  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:10):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[1:02:14-1:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:14):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food

**[1:02:24-1:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:24):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[1:02:27-1:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:27):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[1:02:30-1:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:30):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[1:02:34-1:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:34):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:39):**  Is this course free?  
**[1:02:40-1:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:40):**  No.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:41):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:44):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[1:02:49-1:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:49):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[1:02:53-1:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:53):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[1:02:58-1:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:02:58):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:01):**  Thank you.  
**[1:03:02-1:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:02):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:03:03-1:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:03):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:03:10-1:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:10):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:12):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:03:17-1:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:17):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:03:22-1:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:22):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[1:03:27-1:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:27):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:29):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:03:33-1:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:33):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:03:37-1:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:37):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:42):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:03:43-1:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:43):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:03:45-1:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:45):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:48):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:03:51-1:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:51):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:53):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:03:58-1:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/boris-spassky#t=1:03:58):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

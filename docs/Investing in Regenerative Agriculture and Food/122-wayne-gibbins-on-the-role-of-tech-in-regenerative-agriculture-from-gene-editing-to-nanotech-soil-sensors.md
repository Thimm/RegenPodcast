**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:13):**  What is the role of technology in the regenerative movement?  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:17):**  Agtech investments have exploded over the last years and I would argue that most of  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:21):**  them are not focused on helping farmers to build their soils.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:24):**  So what are the questions you, as an investor, should ask when seeing all of these decks  
**[0:00:28-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:28):**  promising the moon and the stars and everything else?  
**[0:00:31-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:31):**  And what about the darker side of tech like gene editing or the maybe less darker side  
**[0:00:34-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:34):**  like marker-assistant breeding?  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:37):**  Join me on this deep dive into tech, agtech and regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:41):**  Make sure you stay until the end where Mark joins us again to share fundraising updates  
**[0:00:46-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:46):**  and how investors are responding to the technology angle of Neofoundation Farms.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:53):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:57-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:57):**  Thinking as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:00:59):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:01:03):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:01:08):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:01:13):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:01:15):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:01:19):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:01:21):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:01:26):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:01:30):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:01:34):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:01:37):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:01:42):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:01:55):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:01:57):**  Welcome to another episode where we dive deeper and deeper into new foundation farms today  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:01):**  with the CTO Wayne Gibbons on the role of tech in region egg.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:05):**  Welcome Wayne.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:06):**  I can, how are you?  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:07):**  I'm very good.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:08):**  Thank you so much for coming on in a very, very busy period, but I want to dive deep  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:13):**  into to start with your personal story.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:15):**  And we already discussed it a bit in the pre-interview and I know you have some interesting insights  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:19):**  into that.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:20):**  Why are you working on soil from all the other things in tech you could be doing or non-tech?  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:24):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:26):**  I spent 20 years in technology startups, so founding startups, investing in startups and  
**[0:02:33-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:33):**  operating in startups, everything from product management to engineering, writing code, investing,  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:40):**  sitting on boards, advising, working with accelerators.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:44):**  And the consistent thing about all of them, whilst we were building stuff is we weren't  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:49):**  manifesting anything physical.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:51):**  The output was a digital output and it felt quite abstract and distanced from the real  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:02:59):**  world.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:00):**  You might be building software for software developers to write more software or social  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:04):**  media marketing of a social media company so that people can talk online.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:09):**  And to be honest, it eventually just felt very abstract to me.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:14):**  So I took a few years out and I traveled around Europe investigating alternative ways to live,  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:21):**  specifically intentional community.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:23):**  And the ways people were approaching this kind of radical new way of living had a fundamental  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:30):**  link which was the use of permaculture or an understanding of the soil and the water  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:35):**  cycles.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:37):**  And that was everywhere from the mountains of Switzerland to the arid regions of Portugal.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:42):**  And so I went off and studied permaculture.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:45):**  And this was really for someone that grew up in a countryside, I grew up, spent my childhood  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:51):**  in a farming village in Northamptonshire.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:54):**  We were surrounded by farms.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:55):**  There were probably seven farms in the village alone.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:03:58):**  My godfather was a farmer.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:04:00):**  I've got photos of me driving combine harvesters and tractors at the age of six, thankfully  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:04:05):**  with adult supervision.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:04:07):**  So I grew up in quite a rural setting, one would think with a knowledge of the way the  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:04:12):**  world works, ecologically speaking.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:04:15):**  And yet permaculture, the course was radical.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:04:18):**  You know, genuinely, what's the most radical thing that you still remember from that?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:04:23):**  I mean, everything from the discovery of mycorrhizal fungi to soil microbial life to companion  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:04:31):**  planting, you know, my father had a garden, we grew vegetables.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:04:35):**  I'd never been told about companion planting.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:04:38):**  I hadn't really understood natural predators in the sense of pest control.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:04:44):**  You know, I think my dad used Roundup as a child.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:04:48):**  So just understanding this more sort of ecological way of producing food and doing it with real  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:04:55):**  understanding of how nature works, I think was really interesting.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:04:58):**  Now, I was driving a Land Rover around Europe for many hours on my own.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:05:04):**  So I also listened to a lot of books, right.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:05:06):**  And you know, you'd have read the same books, but everything from subjects on new models  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:05:12):**  of economy, people like Charles Eisenstein, regenerative agriculture, including people  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:05:17):**  like Gabe Brown, books on ecology and all sorts of sort of books that are moving the  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:05:24):**  world in a direction where we can be more sustainable, we can live a more free life  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:05:29):**  in a way, more fulfilled life.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:05:32):**  And so last year, I kind of came up with a concept for a relatively small farm, which  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:05:37):**  would integrate farming with technology startups.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:05:42):**  And a few months into that business planning, I met Mark and Marcus and joined the team  
**[0:05:46-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:05:46):**  at New Foundation Farms.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:05:48):**  So it's been a sort of a four year journey, really following a 20 year career in technology.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:05:53):**  And part of me wanted to reject, reject wholeheartedly the technology part, right, because it's the  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:06:00):**  I've been spent, you know, 20 years on airplanes in offices, under bright lights and sitting  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:06:05):**  in front of a computer screen writing code or, or more recently in spreadsheets.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:06:11):**  And the natural reaction was to reject the whole thing.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:06:14):**  But as I decided to transition into agriculture the last three, four years, actually, I felt  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:06:20):**  that the technology was a sensible bridge.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:06:22):**  And it's led me on to doing a master's degree at the Royal Agricultural University in agricultural  
**[0:06:27-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:06:27):**  technology and innovation.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:06:29):**  And I'm driving that academic path down a regenerative line, too.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:06:34):**  I'd say that the university itself is not necessarily promoting regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:06:40):**  But the great thing about masters, of course, is you can sort of self direct your learning.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:06:44):**  So hopefully all the things are starting to join up.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:06:48):**  That's extremely interesting.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:06:49):**  I think we're getting to a moment now in the movement, or at least I'm seeing that in my  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:06:54):**  or our little bubble, that people with experience from outside agriculture and food are coming  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:01):**  into it and bringing their experience sometimes willingly.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:04):**  And sometimes you have to drag it a bit into it like the technology piece or sometimes  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:09):**  it's really I mean, we're obviously here and also others with deep financial knowledge  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:14):**  and bringing that to ag deep cooking knowledge could be very relevant.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:17):**  Just knowledge of building staff, building companies, venture knowledge is extremely  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:21):**  useful and we need all hands on deck in this case to turn this around.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:26):**  So it's very interesting.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:27):**  And what do you see now?  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:28):**  I mean, we're talking, let's say, spring, summer 2021.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:31):**  It's a very open question.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:33):**  But what do you see as the role of technology in agriculture and especially in soil building  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:39):**  agriculture?  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:40):**  There's a lot of hype around ag tech, I think every other week we see the numbers go up  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:43):**  and more money has been poured into ag tech in general.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:46):**  I would say most of it is not focused on soil building.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:49):**  So you would say there's a role but what is that role of technology in building soil at  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:54):**  scale?  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:55):**  I'm adding to that.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:56):**  First, you know, you're right, regenerative ag is a mindset.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:07:59):**  It's a mindset, it's a movement.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:01):**  And it's a utilisation of various agricultural practices combined together in an appropriate  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:07):**  context, right?  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:08):**  Whether that be a climate context, or the country you're in, or the farm you're on,  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:11):**  or the field you're tending.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:14):**  So it's mindset driven.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:15):**  And the way we use technology, as you'll know from using mobile phones, or, or laptops,  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:21):**  or any technology is so diverse, right?  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:24):**  With a different mindset, you can be an entirely different person and use technology in an  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:29):**  entirely different way.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:30):**  So what are we trying to achieve with regenerative ag?  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:33):**  So you know, we have soil health, but we also have ecosystem health, and we have human health,  
**[0:08:39-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:39):**  and farm prosperity.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:40):**  And within that, we have animal health and welfare, we have plant health and nutrition.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:45):**  Within the soil health, we have carbon sequestration, we're trying to contribute to reversing climate  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:50):**  change.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:51):**  In the ecosystem health, we've got biodiversity gain, how can we measure and monitor that?  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:08:56):**  We've got ecosystem services, how do we reduce externalities, pollution tracking, fossil  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:01):**  fuel usage, greenhouse gases.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:04):**  That's before that, they're the primary outcomes, right?  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:07):**  The principles we might look at then on the field level are minimizing soil disturbance,  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:11):**  not having bare ground and integrating livestock, optimizing diversity.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:15):**  So we start to look at technology that can help us move from minimum to no chemicals,  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:20):**  or minimum to no fertilizer, or minimum to no tillage, or even to organic.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:25):**  Cover cropping technology, how do we retain residues?  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:28):**  How do we work with mulch and green manures?  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:30):**  How do we under sow?  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:32):**  How do we work with animal integration?  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:34):**  So apiculture, how do we use holistic plan grazing and multi-species rotations?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:40):**  How do we integrate trees?  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:41):**  How do we use integrated pest management?  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:44):**  How do we manage our complex crop rotations?  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:47):**  So that's what we're trying to achieve.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:50):**  And we're doing all that with an innate knowledge of energy cycles, carbon cycles, nutrient  
**[0:09:55-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:55):**  cycles and water cycles.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:09:58):**  And below that even we've got the soil science, the hydrological science and the biogeochemistry,  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:03):**  which drives our decision making on a daily basis.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:07):**  So with all that, now let's look at the technology.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:10):**  Before we get into the field level, let's look a bit broader, right?  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:13):**  We might be using satellite imagery to evaluate our farms and fields.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:18):**  And I'm particularly fond of open source and technology that's available to everyone.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:24):**  So the European Sentinel-2 satellite data is now available at certain resolutions for  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:29):**  free.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:30):**  So how can we use that data?  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:32):**  Maybe we can work with a startup that's using that data to give us, you know, that's layering  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:37):**  on AI to analyze any number of things from weather to water flows or whatever.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:44):**  We might be using Google Earth, something like Google Earth, right, to plan a farm design.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:48):**  Maybe we're doing some key line design and we're using Google Earth.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:51):**  We're layering on data that we've got from the satellite imagery or data that we've taken  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:56):**  from drones.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:10:57):**  That gives us a better insight to make planning decisions on where we might plant trees.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:03):**  Maybe we're using the latest software as a service, right, SaaS based Martech stack,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:07):**  and we're running our website, our e-commerce and our social promotions, which might not  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:11):**  sound like farming.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:14):**  But if one of the challenges of a farm is increasing the food pound, how much they can  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:19):**  sell and having direct to consumer retail, then we're going to want the right technology  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:23):**  solutions to support that.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:25):**  Your online shop needs to work.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:27):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:28):**  And I suppose the point here is that this is now available, right?  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:31):**  I spent three years investing in SaaS and cloud based technology companies from 2013.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:37):**  And before these companies existed, this was really only in the realms of the very large  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:43):**  enterprise companies and it is now available.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:46):**  So you're really saying something has shifted over the last five plus years that a lot of  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:51):**  this technology now is available at almost any price level, let's say, obviously not  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:11:56):**  if you're farming half a hectare in Liberia, it's different.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:00):**  But for most in the global north, let's say farmers, a lot of this technology is actually  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:06):**  at your fingertips.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:08):**  And of course, there are underlying mega trends, right?  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:10):**  There are trends in the cloud, development of the cloud, development of open source software.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:16):**  There's a whole bunch of miniaturization, mobile, social, there's a whole bunch of mega  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:20):**  trends which enable this to happen.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:22):**  But it means that software startups are, you know, on a daily basis popping up to solve  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:26):**  different problems.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:28):**  And whilst they might not be agriculturally focused, they can certainly be used by agri  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:33):**  food businesses to accelerate their growth.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:36):**  And that includes things like data management, data collection, online sales, point of sale,  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:40):**  and using that data to accurately predict things like stocking requirements in your  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:44):**  farm shop or planting and harvesting schedules in your greenhouses.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:48):**  There's tech to support loyalty and consumer facing traceability of food products.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:52):**  So when someone walks into your farm shop, they could point their mobile phone at the  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:12:55):**  piece of lamb or the apple and they can see the name of the animal that where the joint  
**[0:13:00-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:00):**  came from.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:01):**  They can see where the tree is located because we've GPS tagged the trees.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:05):**  They can see the traceability of the food products.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:08):**  We might be using HRM software to support the people and the training, onboarding, learning  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:13):**  development or contractor management.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:15):**  So forget that for one second.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:16):**  The point is not all ag tech is necessarily ag tech.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:20):**  But when we do move down to the field, we've got some great things.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:23):**  We want to integrate trees.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:24):**  Okay, well, when we integrate trees, we're not integrating them in nice, even lines where  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:29):**  people can go and pick them in a monoculture.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:32):**  We're going to be integrated them maybe on key lines or using some sort of agroforestry  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:36):**  like silver pasture or alley cropping or any number of things, which is going to make it  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:41):**  really difficult to know where the trees are for the pickers.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:43):**  So maybe we can use RFID tags and GPS to improve the efficiency.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:48):**  Now if we've done that to improve the efficiency for the pickers, then we can also send them  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:52):**  out with mobile phone apps to take photos of the trees.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:55):**  And they're non-specialists, right?  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:56):**  They're not tree surgeons.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:13:57):**  They're not specialist arboriculturists.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:00):**  But the mobile phone app with a picture could use AI to identify diseases or problems that  
**[0:14:05-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:05):**  the trees are having.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:06):**  And then we can deploy specialists into exactly the right location.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:09):**  So it's a huge efficiency gain, but we're not replacing humans here.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:12):**  We're simply augmenting humans.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:14):**  And I think that's quite key to our sort of philosophy.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:17):**  And how much of this is already happening in a sense that it sounds amazing.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:21):**  I haven't seen a lot of it.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:23):**  I mean, some of it we've discussed, I think, in an interview with Abby Rose.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:26):**  They've been doing with RFID tags on their olive trees in Chile, if I'm not mistaken.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:31):**  How much of this is super edgy?  
**[0:14:33-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:33):**  How much of this is already happening and just I don't know about it?  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:36):**  And how much of this still has to be completely developed and you'll be experimenting with?  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:40):**  I think nothing I'm going to say in this interview, apart from the imaginary or philosophical  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:45):**  questions that you might ask me.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:47):**  None of the tech that I'm talking about is not available, whether it's a software startup,  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:52):**  whether it's technology that you might need to integrate yourself and build into a technology  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:14:56):**  stack, or whether it's open source and you know, you need to do a bit more manual integration.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:01):**  Nothing's particularly edgy, I would say.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:04):**  I'd say maybe it's not mainstream use, right?  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:06):**  But it doesn't mean the technology is not available.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:08):**  So you might have say livestock monitoring, you know, the Fitbit for cows.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:13):**  New Foundation farms are promoting our animals to be outdoors as much as possible, maybe  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:17):**  all the time, right?  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:18):**  With overwintering.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:20):**  So being able to monitor, manage and measure animals to optimize for their health and well-being  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:23):**  becomes a useful tool.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:25):**  Knowing where they are, being able to plan rotational grazing or holistic plan grazing  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:30):**  using software with field maps, understand stocking density, calculating how much time  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:34):**  to graze each field based on, you know, we know what cover crops are in that field or  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:39):**  what the herb rich lay looks like.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:41):**  And then scheduling manual moves, maybe remotely opening gates or sending an alert to someone's  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:46):**  phone to say, please go and move cattle from field A to field B.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:50):**  And then we get to something like drones or autonomous robots, right?  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:53):**  And everyone gets a bit scared that they're going to have their jobs replaced.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:56):**  Well, actually, nobody really wants to do mechanical weeding, right?  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:15:59):**  I've spoken to many farmers and nobody wants to do mechanical weeding or non-chemical  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:04):**  weeding, right?  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:05):**  It's quite a labor intensive process.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:06):**  So if we can use autonomous robots like the small robot company are developing or others,  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:12):**  if we can use drones equipped with optical and multispectral sensors to monitor crops  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:16):**  from the air, monitor farm boundaries, survey damage from weather or, you know, even act  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:21):**  as a security measure, then these are relatively sensible things we can do.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:25):**  So where do you start?  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:26):**  Because you're building a large farm and we were talking a thousand acres.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:31):**  I think you shared probably 20 or 30 technology pieces, which all sound essential, honestly,  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:36):**  but you cannot, like, they might not all talk to each other, incorporate, they might be  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:41):**  building on different platforms, et cetera.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:42):**  Exactly.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:43):**  What's the piece where you, like, when you would have purchased the land?  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:47):**  I mean, mentioning in the design piece first, but what's the most essential piece?  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:51):**  Okay, if I had to choose, that will be first because that's where we need to start.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:54):**  And that's the most essential building block.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:16:57):**  And then the drones will come later or then the robots will come or then the app for the  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:01):**  pickers will follow in year four or something.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:03):**  Okay.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:04):**  Well, in reverse order, I think the robots are going to come later down the line, right?  
**[0:17:08-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:08):**  I was just giving it as an example of a process.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:10):**  And again, mechanical weeding might be much more relevant if you're growing field vegetables,  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:16):**  right?  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:17):**  Of course.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:18):**  Where you need that kind of inter-row weeding, as opposed to say where you've got field crops  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:23):**  and you've got some clover under sown, so you're avoiding bare soil and you're not allowing  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:29):**  weeds to dominate.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:30):**  So I'm not saying that robots would be everywhere.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:33):**  The technologies that would be looked at initially would probably be based on the farm.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:37):**  So tree integration or agroforestry might come later down the line.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:42):**  It might be a planting process over the first five years.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:46):**  So you might just do GPS tracking of where the tree is.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:50):**  You don't really need much technology, right?  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:52):**  You just need to know there's been a tree planted here and this is what it does.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:55):**  It's more of a software solution.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:17:57):**  You're much more likely to look at sort of mainstream farming machinery and start to  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:01):**  sort of ponder whether we need, what's our rotation going to be.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:05):**  We might want to look at things like mobile fencing and poly pipe water feeds for cattle,  
**[0:18:11-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:11):**  right?  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:12):**  If we're doing holistic plant grazing, we might look at a complex, again, the complex  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:16):**  rotation itself of the crops will be built up over time.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:20):**  But let's imagine we have a complex rotation so we can get a four year, we can integrate  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:26):**  our animals, we can build soil.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:28):**  That's a complex question on a thousand acres, obviously.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:31):**  That's where I see software.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:32):**  I mean, we had E-Agronom on twice now.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:35):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:36):**  Very simply planning the, even the non-complex rotation, like they mentioned like how to  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:41):**  make sure you don't rotation yourself into problems because certain crops cannot follow  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:45):**  each other.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:46):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:47):**  But in some cases, eight, nine years before you might end up, especially if you have different  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:52):**  fields that are not connected, you end up in a big mess because your similar crops are  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:18:56):**  too far away from each other or they have to be followed by another crop that you really  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:00):**  don't want to plant there.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:01):**  And you need to have a long-term view there, which is where software can really, really  
**[0:19:06-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:06):**  help just to make sure that you don't rotate yourself into big trouble.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:09):**  Right, exactly.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:10):**  You've got the knowing where you have planted things, knowing when the things you've planted  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:16):**  need harvesting or tending to, but also knowing why are you planting the thing there, right?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:22):**  What's the soil nutrition or the soil physical qualities or the soil biological needs or  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:29):**  resource constraints as Gabe would put it.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:32):**  And also then how are you going to market what you've planted there, right?  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:35):**  Like regenerative agriculture becomes a knowledge economy rather than a merely farmer as operator.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:40):**  And it takes a while.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:41):**  I've certainly not figured out yet if I were to plant linseeds or beans or peas, exactly  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:47):**  what the best off-taker is for that.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:49):**  Are we going to, you know, we're not necessarily going to sell everything in the farm shop.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:52):**  There might be some cover crops that can be grazed.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:55):**  There might be other cover crops that could be taken off and fractionated, right?  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:19:59):**  So I've seen peas being fractionated into pea starch and pea protein and then the pea  
**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:03):**  protein going off into some energy bar or something.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:06):**  Well, that's not a terrible way to use your peas if they've achieved their soil goal.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:11):**  And on the soil, I recently wrote an academic business plan for a soil health intelligence  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:16):**  platform.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:17):**  So it was imaginary, but it would use nanotech to detect soil microbial life and infer soil  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:22):**  biological health.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:23):**  How would it work?  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:24):**  Because when people say nanotech, I never understand what it means.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:27):**  So basically you've got solid state nanotech sensors, which can detect things like gases  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:33):**  and things that escape from the soil biology.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:36):**  And then you ingest it.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:37):**  Very precise sensor.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:39):**  And then you ingest all that data.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:40):**  It doesn't tell you anything on its own, right?  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:41):**  But you ingest all that data into the cloud, you apply some machine learning algorithms,  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:45):**  you figure out looking at training data and other soil samples that you've done where  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:50):**  you know the results, and then you can infer what the soil health issues are.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:55):**  And then maybe you simplify everything, push it down to the farmer's app and say, ah, here  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:20:59):**  are some regenerative ag techniques you can use to improve these soil conditions.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:03):**  Maybe this is the next crop you should put in your rotation.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:05):**  And it might sound far fetched, but as I was writing it and researching it, a lot of the  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:09):**  companies that would be required already exist or are in development at one stage or another  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:14):**  at development to make this a reality, right?  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:17):**  And so a highly portable, lightweight device that can do the work that would currently  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:21):**  require taking samples into a lab and having a soil microbiologist look at it through a  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:26):**  scanning electron microscope, being able to do that on site in real time, you know, super  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:31):**  exciting.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:32):**  And here's where we get to one of the principles, right?  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:34):**  We're working with nature, science and technology to make better ecological decisions that drive  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:40):**  economic performance on the farm.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:42):**  And I think that's a key guiding principle.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:44):**  Are we really working when we're choosing regenerative ag tech?  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:47):**  Are we really working with the best natural processes, the best scientific understanding  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:52):**  and appropriate use of technology?  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:55):**  You might say we're not using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, right?  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:21:58):**  So as an investor, because you're an investor as well, and I think a lot of investors that  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:02):**  are listening to this get very excited when you mentioned that, but also get like they  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:07):**  get flooded with decks with act companies that claim all sorts of things about soil  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:12):**  because everybody now puts obviously some SDGs here and there, some things in their  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:15):**  deck, etc.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:16):**  Would that be a question you ask?  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:18):**  Or how would you phrase that as a question to a company that's pitching to you to get  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:23):**  you on board as an investor to see if they're really truly focused on building soil health?  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:28):**  How would you ask?  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:29):**  How would you tease that out of pitch?  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:30):**  Well, the challenge with a lot of ag tech, I think, and I haven't actually deeply looked  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:35):**  at investing in the space for the last couple of years, I've been busy doing other things.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:38):**  But my understanding from the market is that occasionally these technologies built in some  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:44):**  form of isolation, right?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:45):**  And whilst there might be some great research scientists or some great business development  
**[0:22:49-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:49):**  people or whatever, the on farm application or the having a farmer on the board, for example,  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:56):**  is a missing gap.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:22:57):**  So they're also looking at, you know, let's go back to nanotech, right?  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:01):**  There's nanotech companies building technology to deploy, say, fertiliser wrapped up in sort  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:06):**  of little nano particles in order to radically reduce the amount of fertiliser needed.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:12):**  That's great.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:13):**  But what if the cost of development plus the cost for the farmer to purchase and you wrap  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:16):**  all that cost up is actually not the most efficient way to solve that problem.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:21):**  And we're just using technology to solve problems that could otherwise be solved in another  
**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:26):**  way.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:27):**  And then finally, if you've got a soil health sensor, and I came up with this problem in  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:30):**  my research is, where do you measure?  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:33):**  And how often do you measure?  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:34):**  Do you take a reading every day?  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:36):**  Do you take a reading every day at 10 points in each field?  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:40):**  If you're over 1000 acres, then that's a full time job or more.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:44):**  And what's the data actually telling you, right?  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:46):**  Like that you didn't know already just from looking at the soil.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:49):**  So we work with 3LM and one of the Savory Institute partners and they use the ecological  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:54):**  outcome verification, which is mainly an observational, you know, there's obviously some looking for  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:23:59):**  earthworms and stuff, but it's mainly observing the ecosystem.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:03):**  And you can use technology, you can use acoustic technology to listen to bird life, for example,  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:09):**  or insect life, which uses AI again, to analyse the ecosystem health.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:14):**  Have you seen companies doing that?  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:15):**  I am super curious about it.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:16):**  Not just companies, there are startups doing that.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:18):**  But they're also some of the research papers I've read have done that at the kind of academic  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:23):**  research level.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:24):**  So there's some super interesting things.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:27):**  And then if we, one thing that's often ignored, I just thought I'd mention it, the somewhat  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:31):**  scarier side of ag tech, right?  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:33):**  And I've, again, it's some stuff that we've covered on our course, genetic manipulation,  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:37):**  right?  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:38):**  As soon as you think of regenerative ag and GMO, you think that they're, you know, they're  
**[0:24:43-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:43):**  a million miles apart, right?  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:44):**  And maybe so they should be.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:46):**  The horrors associated with mixing animal and plant genes together in some kind of Frankenstein  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:50):**  experiment.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:51):**  I'm not a fan of those types of crops, right?  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:54):**  That said, if you actually follow the genetics in agriculture, there's some advancements  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:24:58):**  that are a bit less Frankenstein that make use of genetics.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:25:02):**  And one is modification, a modification technique, and one is not modifying the plant.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:25:07):**  And so the first one's called CRISPR-Cas9.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:25:11):**  And that's like a highly accurate genetic tool akin to a scalpel and precision surgery  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:25:15):**  where they can literally open up a piece of DNA and insert a tiny strand.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:25:20):**  And they're saying that when that's done, it's almost emulating that mutation could  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:25:26):**  have happened by natural selection or random mutation.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:25:30):**  It's that tiny level of detail that's so small that it could happen by mutation.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:25:34):**  Which suggested we know how that exactly happens in nature, which I think is an interesting...  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:25:39):**  I mean, we're still selecting for, we're still trying to make something do something that  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:25:43):**  it hasn't naturally done.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:25:45):**  And I'm not fully made my mind upon on it yet.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:25:48):**  And of course it could be used, I'm sure, for not such good ways, but...  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:25:52):**  I think there's a risk in a sense that it assumes that we fully understand the gene  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:25:57):**  part and thus we can make changes in it.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:00):**  And I think time and time again, we show that we actually don't fully understand the gene  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:03):**  part and thus we'll make mistakes and we'll mess up stuff that we don't know.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:09):**  Which is why the second one I'm going to mention is less scary, right?  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:13):**  This is called marker assisted selection.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:16):**  So for hundreds of years we've been doing plant breeding and animal breeding and now  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:20):**  we have marker assisted selection, which means we can effectively do what we've always done,  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:25):**  but we can see the observation we're doing is not just, oh, this plant is bigger or this  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:31):**  fruit is juicier, but we're looking at the traits at the DNA level.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:36):**  And so DNA markers allow marker assisted selection so that we can then breed for things like  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:41):**  climate adaptation, right?  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:43):**  We might want to breed something that's drought tolerant or...  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:45):**  And with DNA markers, basically the markers have no influence on the DNA or at least we  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:49):**  don't know yet.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:50):**  No, exactly.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:51):**  But you can follow them like a fluorescent light basically following through.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:54):**  Exactly.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:26:55):**  My understanding is it's just a way to select certain seeds or whatever to propagate plants  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:00):**  that are...  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:01):**  A lot faster.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:02):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:03):**  With a depth of insight that was beyond.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:05):**  And you might say, well, how is this natural, right?  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:06):**  Where new foundations are radical natural farming.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:09):**  Well, farming naturally for me is about working with nature, using natural cycles, the ecosystem,  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:14):**  knowledge of synergies and so on, you know, mycorrhizal fungi, all the synergies that  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:18):**  we can work with.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:19):**  But most food that we eat is not natural.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:22):**  It's been domesticated.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:24):**  Just like animals were domesticated, plants we eat, pears are in...  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:27):**  Corn, everything.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:28):**  Grapefruit, chestnuts, walnuts, wheat, barley, oats, rice, corn, watermelons.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:32):**  If you look at the original natural version, you wouldn't eat it.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:36):**  You wouldn't recognize it.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:37):**  Apple's the same, bro.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:39):**  And you know, we've taken that too far in some examples.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:42):**  You know, there's the Dambaba talks in the third play about his corn that they've bred  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:47):**  a more ancient corn.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:48):**  And of course, it's still nothing like the natural corn, which was a strand of corn.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:54):**  But it's certainly not the massive corn that you get today.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:56):**  So there are examples of us taking that too far.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:27:58):**  And we should be careful not to shout out to the book.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:02):**  Definitely if you haven't read it.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:03):**  It's a good book.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:04):**  It's a few years old now, but it's fascinating.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:07):**  So I think the point there and I'll probably come on to this in a later question is that  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:10):**  we shouldn't be against plant breeding, right?  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:12):**  Then you should stop eating basically at the moment.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:15):**  In such challenging times, if we can work with an understanding of science to look at  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:20):**  the restorative qualities of plants, maybe right, look at how mycorrhizal fungal synergies  
**[0:28:24-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:24):**  work and have plants that can help restore soil under certain climatic stresses, right?  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:31):**  So we can both mitigate and adapt to climate pressures where wherever we're growing food,  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:35):**  I've just been doing a paper on Southeast Asia and that's hugely vulnerable to climate  
**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:40):**  change.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:41):**  And so I thought, oh, maybe the UK is not as bad, right?  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:44):**  But actually in the last decade alone, lots of farms have really struggled with heavy  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:48):**  rain storms and long dry spells.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:50):**  And various articles have suggested that farmers are just not adapting to these conditions.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:55):**  So we need to look at technology both from the regenerative viewpoint, as well as the  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:28:59):**  kind of macro ecological context of climate change, right, which we're in whether we like  
**[0:29:03-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:03):**  it or not.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:04):**  Whilst we might suggest that regenerative ag can solve that problem, it can definitely  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:10):**  contribute to carbon sequestration and biodiversity gain and all of the great ecosystem services,  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:17):**  we also need to adapt, right?  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:19):**  We're not going to do it in time for the average temperature not to change, right?  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:23):**  It's just not realistic.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:24):**  So I think all farms everywhere, even in the UK, will need to think about technology in  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:29):**  both of these contexts, regenerate the soil and also adapt to a changing climate.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:34):**  And looking at all these technologies, let's say we switch you from being the CTO of new  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:39):**  foundation farms to being in charge of a $1 billion investment fund or £1 billion, you  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:44):**  got lucky.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:45):**  It's an investment fund, meaning no grants can be super long term, you can come up with  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:49):**  the return target you want.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:51):**  But what would you focus on in terms of even maybe not technology?  
**[0:29:55-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:55):**  I mean, I'm making an assumption here.  
**[0:29:57-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:57):**  What would you focus on as an investment strategy?  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:29:59):**  Well, assuming that everything I said about agriculture is true, and it's where I want  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:04):**  to spend the next sort of 20, 30 years, let's keep it focused on agriculture.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:08):**  Probably let's also keep it focused on the UK.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:11):**  Of course, it would be an international fund, right?  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:13):**  Probably but whatever you want.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:15):**  I mean, it's up to you.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:17):**  There's probably three or four categories.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:19):**  Obviously coming from the tech background, it makes sense.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:21):**  I probably would have a portion, maybe 25 to 33% of the fund would be regenerative ag  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:28):**  tech.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:29):**  So that would be investing in early stage, mid stage startups, and possibly even acquiring  
**[0:30:33-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:33):**  startups into the portfolio that can accelerate the adoption of transition to regenerative  
**[0:30:41-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:41):**  or otherwise practices, right?  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:43):**  We have to understand that the term regenerative agriculture is very similar to other terms  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:48):**  like conservation agriculture, climate smart agriculture, nature based solutions, ecological  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:53):**  based adaptation, depending on whether you're coming from a climate perspective or an agricultural  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:30:57):**  perspective, depending on whether you're coming from the agricultural industry or the agricultural  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:31:02):**  research sector, lots of language, and actually, they have more in common with each other than  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:31:06):**  they do with conventional agriculture, which is I think the most important thing.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:31:10):**  So startups acquire and invest in startups that are accelerating that space.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:31:16):**  The other thing is, I think, an agri food company builder, I build an agri food company  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:31:22):**  builder, which invests in the physical space as well as the investments in the companies  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:31:27):**  to build agri food companies from the ground up that can use the kind of off take things  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:31:33):**  like cover crops or things that are the outputs of the farm and produce food designed from  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:31:39):**  the ground up to be regenerative in their supply chain, rather than being like, Oh,  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:31:43):**  I'm going to invent this burger, and then I'm going to go and try and source ingredients.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:31:47):**  It's like, Oh, actually, let's invent this burger.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:31:50):**  Because we know that we can get pea protein from this regenerative farm, we can get regenerative  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:31:53):**  meat from this farm, and we can build a regenerative burger, which is like 40% beef, but it's 60%  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:32:00):**  plant protein, which means that our meat eaters are happy, the flavors great, but we're reducing  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:32:05):**  our beef consumption by 60%.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:32:07):**  For me, that's the will be at least in our beef burgers, that would be a cool idea.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:32:11):**  So an agri food company builder that builds, you know, weird and wacky things that I just  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:32:15):**  talked about to improve human health, but use regenerative products, regenerative agtech  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:32:20):**  VC fund.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:32:22):**  And the third point would probably be some kind of land acquisition and partnership strategy,  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:32:26):**  not dissimilar to the way New Foundation Farms are looking to acquire land and work with  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:32:29):**  partner farms and, and support the challenge we have in succession planning for farmers,  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:32:34):**  a lot of farmers in the UK are, you know, 58, or I think the average age and or more  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:32:39):**  than more than a certain percentage, but effectively support the acceleration to regenerative farming  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:32:45):**  through supporting the challenge in succession that we have in the UK, supporting new entrant  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:32:51):**  farmers to come on board and work with some kind of share farming scheme and profit share  
**[0:32:55-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:32:55):**  or basically a new model that we've alluded to in our New Foundation Farms framework conversations  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:02):**  that you will have had with Mark, and form this kind of loosely coupled network, right,  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:06):**  of regenerative farms that share data, share equipment, and effectively, New Foundation  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:11):**  Farms in 15 years, I'm sure we'll look something quite similar to that third part of the model.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:16):**  And then finally, there's probably a fourth part around transition finance.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:19):**  And I've not fully worked out whether, how necessary and exactly what purpose that serves.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:25):**  And I think it does serve a purpose for certain parts of the market, but in other parts of  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:29):**  the market, for whatever reason, social, cultural, policy based, it might not work.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:34):**  So yeah, agri food company builder, region agtech VC and some kind of land acquisition  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:39):**  partnership concept.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:40):**  Sounds good.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:41):**  Probably it sounds like you need more than a billion, but that's a...  
**[0:33:44-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:44):**  Yeah, it wouldn't take long to spend.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:45):**  Which is not, I mean, I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:48):**  And to end with a few questions I always like to ask, I mean, this is one of them, but if  
**[0:33:52-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:52):**  you could change one thing in the food and ag space, so you have a magic wand, you no  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:33:55):**  longer have the fund, unfortunately, but there's one thing you could change, also beyond the  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:01):**  food and ag space, if you want to do, I don't know, nuclear fusion, et cetera, but one thing  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:05):**  tomorrow morning we wake up and Wayne has changed, what would that be?  
**[0:34:09-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:09):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:10):**  I might be allowed to say something around education or policy, but the American ecologist,  
**[0:34:16-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:16):**  Aldo Leopold, you probably know the book Sand County Almanac.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:19):**  I've heard about it.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:20):**  In the book he says, education, I fear, is learning to see one thing by going blind to  
**[0:34:26-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:26):**  another.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:27):**  And that just seems so true.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:30):**  Reading that, it just seems so true of our kind of human evolution.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:35):**  And I think if I could wave a magic wand, it would be to reverse the damage done with  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:38):**  industrial agriculture or let's say the industrialization of agriculture, right?  
**[0:34:43-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:43):**  We're not blaming farmers here.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:45):**  We're saying the process itself has been damaging.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:48):**  And do that by placing a deep ecological understanding at the center of all agricultural education,  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:53):**  management, policy and investment, somewhat of a North Star, right?  
**[0:34:57-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:57):**  So that we can guide the way we work with nature.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:34:59):**  And effectively referring back to that quote, opening the eye that may have been closed  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:04):**  by many of us, restoring our connection to the earth.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:07):**  That said, we don't want to hark back to like days gone by where farming used to be amazing  
**[0:35:12-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:12):**  because we know-  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:13):**  It wasn't.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:14):**  It's just not true in many ways.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:16):**  Realistically, this is a transcendent include approach, bringing the best of our ancestral  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:20):**  knowledge together with the latest soil science and technological innovations to build the  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:24):**  future farming for the benefits of rural communities, human health and the health of our ecosystems.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:30):**  So yeah, it's basically opening that eye.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:33):**  And we touched upon a few ones, but maybe you have another one as well.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:37):**  Where are you contrarian in this space?  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:39):**  Like what do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't  
**[0:35:43-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:43):**  or most others don't?  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:44):**  And this definitely comes from interviews with John Kemp that often asked this question  
**[0:35:49-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:49):**  on General Ag on his interviewees.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:51):**  So where are you contrarian in region ag?  
**[0:35:53-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:53):**  Maybe the fact that you think tech is essential in many, many won't, but what else?  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:35:59):**  I think it's something around, let's take religion as an example, right?  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:36:04):**  You have monotheism and you have polytheism, right?  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:36:07):**  And you have mono cropping in agriculture and you have polycropping in agriculture.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:36:12):**  And similarly, we have this kind of monophilosophical view sometimes in regenerative ag, which is  
**[0:36:18-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:36:18):**  this is regenerative ag.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:36:20):**  And actually having written papers on regenerative ag, nobody agrees on the definition, all the  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:36:26):**  principles, all the practices.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:36:28):**  What they do agree on is, you know, it's based on the context of the farm you're on.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:36:32):**  And when we look at the whole process involved in doing the right thing, you draw many philosophical  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:36:39):**  frameworks, right, from permaculture to agroforestry to bits of conservation agriculture and no  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:36:45):**  till, which in itself is a practice often associated with glyphosate, right?  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:36:51):**  Of course, we're talking about a different kind of no till, or maybe we occasionally  
**[0:36:54-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:36:54):**  use a shallow plough.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:36:56):**  I think it's key to not be too stuck in the mud with philosophical frameworks, right,  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:02):**  and use the best of each framework and throw away the bits that don't work for you in the  
**[0:37:07-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:07):**  context that you're in.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:08):**  Tinkering on the land.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:10):**  Exactly.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:11):**  You know, for every farm and every field, there's a unique challenge and a unique solution.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:16):**  And I don't think, you know, anyone can tell you that you're doing it wrong.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:20):**  The overall health of the planet, the ecosystem, the field, the soil, right, should be the  
**[0:37:25-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:25):**  guiding North Star.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:26):**  And hopefully we can use technology, nature, science, and farming knowledge to go in that  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:32):**  direction.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:33):**  I think it's a perfect place to end.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:34):**  Thank you so much, Wayne.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:35):**  Thanks, Kevin.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:37):**  So welcome back, Mark.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:38):**  At the end of this technology episode, and I'm very curious about, first of all, your  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:43):**  general thoughts on this episode or on the discussion we had with Wayne on AgTech and  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:47):**  all the technology pieces, but also how the conversations are going, how are investors  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:52):**  responding to these kind of conversations on CRISPR, on market assistant selection and  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:57):**  things like that?  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:37:58):**  Is there interest in tech or is it a bit scary for them?  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:00):**  Hello, Kevin, again, I get the pleasure of listening to all of these sessions.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:03):**  So the tech side is really interesting.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:06):**  When you listen to Wayne, it really emphasizes the point, in my mind, of the heart of what  
**[0:38:12-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:12):**  we're doing about building a scaled disruptor enterprise.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:15):**  And to do that, you need this kind of breadth of expertise, sitting, if you like, on the  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:20):**  farmer's side of the fence, looking at that world of technology and making, hopefully,  
**[0:38:25-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:25):**  better choices about what we deploy, when and how.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:28):**  In terms of response, we are roughly, I guess, halfway through the focus period of the raise,  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:35):**  which heads towards an initial line in the sand at the end of the month.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:39):**  And I would say we're about halfway there now.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:41):**  At least that's the advice I'm given.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:43):**  We're talking June 2021, just for everybody listening in a year or so.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:47):**  This is where we're at.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:48):**  And let's see you in a month.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:49):**  But yeah, you're saying you're about halfway there.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:51):**  So we think, the advice I'm given is that we're about halfway there in terms of the  
**[0:38:55-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:55):**  raise of 20 million pounds.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:38:57):**  And what's fascinating is, I would say, roughly nine out of 10 people that we reach out to  
**[0:39:03-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:03):**  take the call, which is perhaps not necessarily only about our proposition, but is also to  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:09):**  learn and the sector, what's going on, and the interest in the sector, which is super  
**[0:39:14-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:14):**  exciting.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:15):**  And when do you see that bringing the scale we're bringing here, you're bringing here  
**[0:39:21-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:21):**  with new foundation farms, does that change the discussion on technology in a sense that,  
**[0:39:25-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:25):**  for many farmers, we were discussing in the pre-interview as well, technology is something  
**[0:39:29-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:29):**  obviously essential, but also massive investments and massive potential mistakes.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:34):**  What do you see there in terms of the interest in this space?  
**[0:39:38-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:38):**  Everything is possible.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:39):**  You can buy the biggest drones.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:40):**  I remember a farmer buying one of the first drones and spending 15,000 euros.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:44):**  That's a lot of money for a lot of data.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:46):**  And then what do you do with it?  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:47):**  So what do you see that what's different in this case, the new foundation farms?  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:50):**  Well, I think initially, the scale shouldn't have any effect.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:39:56):**  If you're going to have some horticultural controlled environment agriculture, you know,  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:01):**  some sort of greenhouses, right, you might look at what's there and maybe adopt some  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:05):**  small scale irrigation to support the humans that are doing the work.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:10):**  Maybe, maybe it's as simple as an on off, you know, a time system, and then you might  
**[0:40:14-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:14):**  evolve to time system plus sensors.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:17):**  So each section of the greenhouse gets watered to the appropriate amount, right, you might  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:21):**  have controlled lighting, these things don't all need to be done at the same time.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:25):**  You can use a thousand pound drone, I've got one in my cupboard, DJI Mavic Pro, and we  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:30):**  can stick that on drone deploy, and we can look at our land, we can then push the data  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:35):**  into some software online, and we can get all sorts of great things around topography.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:39):**  And we can layer that onto Google Maps, which is free.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:41):**  So Google Earth, so there's nobody saying go out and spend a million quid on tech, right?  
**[0:40:46-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:46):**  Now, the point is, as you see efficiencies, and as you grow, you can replicate those efficiencies  
**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:52):**  across different farms.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:54):**  You can share software platforms, you can share machinery at a bioregional level, you  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:40:59):**  can send someone from the farm around to other farms with that equipment, and again, share  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:04):**  the access.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:05):**  So I'd say it's not about taking big, huge risky leaps, it's about iterative, observation  
**[0:41:12-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:12):**  based, iterative design and expansion of this, right?  
**[0:41:16-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:16):**  So I'm actually quite against spending half a million quid on the latest combine harvester  
**[0:41:20-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:20):**  because it has yield mapping built into its, you know, built into a system, maybe rent  
**[0:41:26-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:26):**  one, see how it works.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:27):**  But yeah, I think there's a risk in taking too bold a step.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:31):**  But as Mark said, there's a huge breadth of solutions, and it's picking the right solution  
**[0:41:36-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:36):**  at the right time based on the context, and what problem we're trying to solve, right?  
**[0:41:40-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:40):**  Maybe there is no problem.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:41):**  So don't throw some tech at it.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:44):**  Let's not create problems that need solving.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:46):**  And then do you see that with investors?  
**[0:41:48-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:48):**  What's their knowledge?  
**[0:41:49-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:49):**  I mean, really depending, obviously, Mark, but on the agtech side, are they excited?  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:53):**  Are they interested?  
**[0:41:54-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:54):**  Are they not asking any questions on it?  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:41:56):**  Are they just assuming we go back to the old days of farming, like we discussed with Wayne,  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:42:01):**  that we're not really there, but like, are they interested in that high tech region part,  
**[0:42:05-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:42:05):**  basically?  
**[0:42:06-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:42:06):**  There's a real mix in level of knowledge and understanding.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:42:09):**  We bump into investors in the space who are predominantly agtech investors, and their  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:42:15):**  whole DNA is to try and understand which magic technology wand is going to become the next  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:42:20):**  unicorn and transform the world, and they'll ride the back of that to financial Nirvana.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:42:26):**  That's on the one extreme.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:42:28):**  On the other end, you get people who are just deeply, deeply focused on the question of  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:42:33):**  how do we change the agri-food system so that it's ecologically sound and have a very limited  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:42:38):**  knowledge of the detail of any of the technology that can support and enable that, and are  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:42:43):**  all focused on just the general ethos of a more regenerative approach to farming.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:42:48):**  There's no neat answer to it, but from our point of view, it's really clear that it's  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:42:52):**  critical to be able to accelerate the transition and to do it cleverly and well.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:42:57):**  I was thinking, as you were talking, most big companies have a CTO for a reason, not  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:43:03):**  because they're the person who's brilliant at writing the code, but because they're the  
**[0:43:07-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:43:07):**  people who do the job of interpreting what technology is best for the application.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:43:13):**  If you sit there and just rely on the supplier to persuade you what's good, you end up in  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:43:19):**  the mess that we're in in industrial agriculture today, which is the suppliers control the  
**[0:43:23-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:43:23):**  knowledge and tell us what to do, and the outcome is we get the system that we now have.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:43:29):**  For us, it's why it's really important to have this knowledge in-house.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:43:32):**  Every farmer needs to have at least part-time a good CTO that chooses, or it should be the  
**[0:43:38-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:43:38):**  farmer or it should be shared, or you need to be able to make those choices.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:43:44):**  That's part of the logic that we see in collaboration is that not every farm is going to be able  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:43:49):**  to have a CTO, but our philosophy, make what we know open source, share the knowledge,  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:43:54):**  and hopefully other people can piggyback on the back of insights that we are developing  
**[0:43:59-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:43:59):**  and will develop in the future.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:44:01):**  I think it's a perfect way to end this conversation.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:44:04):**  Thank you both so much for the time and obviously for the pleasure of checking in.

**[0:44:54-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:44:54):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:44:59-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:44:59):**  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:45:03):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:45:07):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:45:09):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:45:13):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:45:18):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:45:22):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:45:25):**  How have we built our decision making framework, what to focus on with the podcast, how have  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:45:30):**  we picked interviewees, what questions should you ask, what is happening in the space, what  
**[0:45:35-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:45:35):**  should you read, what should you listen, what should you watch, how to approach this space.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:45:41):**  For whom is this course?  
**[0:45:43-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:45:43):**  You, the soil builders and investors in the space.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:45:46):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:45:50):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  
**[0:45:55-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:45:55):**  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management, consultants, etc.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:00):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:03):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:06):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:46:10-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:10):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:15):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:46:16-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:16):**  No.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:17):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:19):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:23):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:46:28-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:28):**  different means.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:29):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:46:34-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:34):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:37):**  Thank you.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:38):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:46:39-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:39):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:46):**  So you don't have to write along.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:47):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:46:52-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:52):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:46:58-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:46:58):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:47:03-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:47:03):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:47:04):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:47:09-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:47:09):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:47:13):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:47:18):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:47:19-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:47:19):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:47:21):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:47:23):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:47:27):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:47:29):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/wayne-gibbins#t=0:47:34):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

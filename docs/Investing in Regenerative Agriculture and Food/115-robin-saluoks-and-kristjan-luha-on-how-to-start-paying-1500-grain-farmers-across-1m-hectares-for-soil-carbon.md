**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:14):**  An update with Robin and Christian of eAgonom who are working with 1500 grain farmers across  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:19):**  1 million hectares in Central and Eastern Europe and they are starting to pay farmers  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:23):**  for the carbon they capture.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:27):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:31):**  the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:35):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:40-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:40):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:47):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:49):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:53):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:58):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:04):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:31-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:31):**  Welcome to another episode.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:32):**  We have Robin and Christian back on the show.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:34):**  In October 2020 we had a long talk about how to partner with farmers and technology and  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:39):**  today they're back and we're going to talk about why they're focusing on carbon.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:43):**  So welcome Christian and Robin.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:45):**  Hello.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:46):**  Hi, it's good to be back.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:47):**  For anybody that didn't listen to the other show I will definitely put a link in the show  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:51):**  notes below but just Robin in two three sentences I mean you've been pitching so often now that  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:56):**  you for sure have memorized the best way to summarize eAgronom but just for anybody that  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:02):**  doesn't know what we're talking about what is eAgronom and then we get into the carbon  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:05):**  into your current round some updates but what is a good a good introduction into what you've  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:10):**  built over the last years?  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:11):**  Yeah absolutely.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:12):**  Well eAgronom is number one farm management system in central east in Europe so farmers  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:18):**  use this to plan manage and analyze their activities and based on this data we also  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:23):**  give advice to farmers what crops to grow what tasks to do what fertilizers to use and  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:28):**  so on and the result of this is increased efficiency so higher profits and actually  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:33):**  also smaller carbon footprint but what makes eAgronom special is that in some cases instead  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:39):**  of farmers paying to us we are paying to farmers so they're benefiting from our carbon program  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:45):**  now and get paid for capturing carbon from the atmosphere into the soil.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:51):**  That's super exciting we're definitely going to unpack that but just to give a flavor of  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:55):**  what has happened since October you've grown a lot like how many farmers are you working  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:59):**  with right now we're talking April 2021 just give an understanding of how many farmers  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:04):**  and then of course the hectares that they represent.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:07):**  Yeah we have about one and a half thousand farms on platform and they manage across this  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:15):**  fleet over a million hectares of grain lands we've recently expanded and made ourselves  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:20):**  available also in Australia our main markets here are here in central eastern Europe biggest  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:26):**  one is Poland, Estonia obviously where we're from as well Latvia we have some clients also  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:33):**  in Romania and Czech and in October we've grown about 50% since which is a good growth  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:39):**  season for us you know we can mostly recruit farmers when they're not on their fields and  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:43):**  that's after harvest and before spring so those have been a good five months for us.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:49):**  Wow that's a good amount of hectares and you're currently obviously this is not investment  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:55):**  advice to anybody listening but I'm very interested in as the title of this podcast Investing  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:59):**  in Regenerative Agriculture and Food you're currently raising a round can you explain  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:04):**  share a bit more on that what you're looking for in terms of investors what you're finding  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:09):**  in the market like how is those discussions over the last six months have gone what are  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:13):**  you seeing in the market in terms of investors that are getting I think at least we see on  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:17):**  our side a lot more interest in the market but maybe a lot of people are new to the space  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:21):**  as well so what have been has been your experience in this latest funded raising round that you  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:25):**  are currently in the middle of?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:27):**  Well first of all why do we need money right now at all?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:30):**  That's a very good question to start with Robin yeah.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:32):**  Yeah well we are number one player in Poland, Estonia and Latvia and beside this we have  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:39):**  some first customers so we can't say we are in those markets but we are ready to start  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:44):**  scaling in those markets in four other markets including actually Australia but mainly in  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:49):**  Poland, Latvia and Estonia we have proved that the Archerum model works quite well so  
**[0:04:54-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:54):**  our annual customer value is higher than the customer acquisition cost and so we are efficient  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:01):**  in recruiting new farmers to the platform we are also upselling the digital advisory  
**[0:05:07-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:07):**  package and now bringing those farmers into carbon program but obviously those three markets  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:14):**  are not enough for changing the agriculture in total and that's why we need the financing  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:19):**  as well to scale to new markets mainly actually the markets where we already have some customer  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:24):**  base but then also to bring carbon program to these farmers so that they can benefit  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:30):**  from capturing more carbon into the soil, growing humus balances, reducing their own  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:35):**  emissions and etc.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:37):**  We touched upon that carbon piece briefly last time we mostly looked at how your platform  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:42):**  and technology and software is helping to plan much better and work much more efficiently  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:47):**  and effectively to make sure that you don't get into you don't rotate yourself into problems  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:52):**  I think we mentioned specifically last time and I keep using that phrase which is very  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:56):**  interesting but the carbon piece I think has shifted quite a bit or has let's say accelerated  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:01):**  over the last months can you explain a bit everybody has seen probably the attention  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:05):**  or the hype we're going up to in terms of soil carbon but what is happening on the ground  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:09):**  with customers your farmers and then potentially other customers that are buying the carbon  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:14):**  the soil carbon of you what has been happening since October since we last spoke?  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:18):**  Absolutely well there are many ways how farmers can benefit from capturing carbon and reducing  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:24):**  their emissions and just to share the load let me explain the first example that we call  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:29):**  soil carbon and then Christian can explain about carbon offset units but with soil carbon  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:36):**  we have managed to successfully reduce the rent land rent of farmers who capture carbon  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:42):**  into the soil as you probably know then half of the land in Europe is not owned by farmers  
**[0:06:48-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:48):**  but rented to farmers 40% in North America so there are plenty of very big landowners  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:56):**  who are long-term investors and they want to make sure that their asset value is safe  
**[0:07:00-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:00):**  in the long term now it's possible to farm in different ways you can farm in a way that  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:07):**  you have more carbon and more humus in the soil every year but you can also farm in a  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:12):**  way that you have less carbon and humus in the soil every year and based on this after  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:17):**  well 10 to 15 years the land value will be different if you capture more carbon to the  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:22):**  soil then you have more nutrients in the soil as well and the land value is higher.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:26):**  Do you see that value already that connection between let's say the health of the soil and  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:31):**  the land value because that's a lot of discussion around that that maybe a lot of investors  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:35):**  don't recognize that or a lot of landowners and thus there's a disconnect between what  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:40):**  we see and what but you see you've been working with some landowners that do recognize that  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:44):**  healthy soils is in there in their benefit.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:47):**  Absolutely well the first landowner with whom we actually made this deal if they are valuing  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:52):**  how much they're ready to pay for a new land that they are buying they're actually looking  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:56):**  down they have a point system and one of the attributes over there is how much humus or  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:02):**  carbon organic carbon there is actually in the soil and it makes sense it really makes  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:07):**  sense and that's how we made a deal with them as well for their farmers farmers who rent  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:12):**  land from them they actually have 14,000 hectares but their farmers obviously have in total  
**[0:08:18-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:18):**  80,000 hectares so farmers who rent land from them and they now give a smaller rent to farmers  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:26):**  with positive humus balance so farmers who capture more carbon from the atmosphere to  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:30):**  the soil and higher rent for farmers who don't do it.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:34):**  And you manage that program for them for this landowner and these farmers are clients of  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:39):**  you as well and how do you manage that how do you measure that?  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:43):**  Yeah so over there we use models that are built by local scientists now if we move more  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:49):**  to the Christian what Christian will explain later about carbon offset units and carbon  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:53):**  offsetting there we use soil samples as well but models are okay for landowners for their  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:58):**  internal use if they trust the models enough then they trust that okay farmers are doing  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:03):**  those activities then their land quality in the future will be higher so models for them  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:08):**  are okay but if we talk about producing carbon credits then soil measuring to verify models  
**[0:09:15-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:15):**  are very important as well.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:16):**  But in this case basically you're working with a large landowner and their farmers and  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:21):**  because you basically are the software for the farmers to manage their full operations  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:28):**  you know what they're doing or not doing in terms of plowing or plowing in terms of applying  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:32):**  certain things etc and they pay a lower rent to the landowner if they apply certain things  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:37):**  which is very interesting because of so longer term it's interesting for them because of  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:41):**  the cost so there's a very interesting relationship there very interesting incentive structure  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:46):**  that you have been able to build and you see that because you did one you see that being  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:50):**  interesting for other you see an interest from other landowners.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:54):**  Yeah we made this deal with a biggest landowner in Estonia and we're currently discussing  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:58):**  with very big landlord in Poland as well but in the end as you said everybody wins so farmer  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:10:04):**  gets to pay smaller land rent and actually the farm gets more efficient as well but that's  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:10:09):**  the secondary benefit then a landowner gets to make sure that their asset value is safe  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:10:14):**  in the long term and then the economy gets both FMS fee and then verification fee from  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:10:19):**  the landowner.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:10:20):**  We get a small fee from both sides which is very interesting and then Christian to you  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:10:24):**  then there's the option to potentially sell these carbon credits with a few extra questions  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:10:30):**  obviously around measurement and around outcome etc what's been happening there?  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:10:34):**  Yeah that opportunity is definitely there but creating carbon credits in farming in  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:10:39):**  itself is not even the main goal the main goal is to create an extra source of revenue  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:10:46):**  for the farmer and if we look if we zoom out a bit farming generally is capital intensive  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:10:53):**  so there's high costs involved but margins are not very high and unpredictability is  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:11:00):**  increasing so there are more and more years where surprises happen extreme weather events  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:11:06):**  bad yields low yields so farmers struggle a bit more than they used to and well and  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:11:13):**  on the other side farming is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions globally then  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:11:18):**  where the opportunity comes in is now on a global level I think the awareness of climate  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:11:24):**  change and the need to do something about it is growing there's Paris climate agreement  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:11:29):**  if you look around many countries and large corporations have committed to become net  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:11:35):**  zero over the next 20 or 30 years and to significantly reduce their emissions and offset the rest  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:11:42):**  and farming is an opportunity because soils are a large carbon sink so that's where we  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:11:48):**  believe farmers can come in and while they continue doing what they do growing crops  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:11:55):**  and feeding the people we can also create an additional source of income here through  
**[0:12:01-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:12:01):**  carbon offsets or carbon removal units and that's the path we've embarked on right now  
**[0:12:08-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:12:08):**  with a small selection of farmers in Estonia and Poland there's a few thousand hectares  
**[0:12:15-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:12:15):**  today piloting based on our methodology we follow FAO guidelines and Rotham see soil  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:12:25):**  sampling models we also work with local scientists to localize the models to local conditions  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:12:32):**  the soils are different and what are conditions are different in each of the countries so  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:12:37):**  we have we do want to make sure we maintain high standards and and meet the highest expectations  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:12:44):**  in terms of methodology project requirements and then how do we establish the baseline  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:12:51):**  how do we model the outcomes and then verify the projected outcomes through soil testing  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:12:57):**  regularly and how far are you in a sense what's missing or where are you already at like let's  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:13:02):**  say a big buyer I mean one of the big ones that has mentioned or smaller ones that said  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:13:07):**  I want to be net positive by this year so I need to offset or remove if they knock on  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:13:12):**  the door maybe they already have like what's the current status of the carbon selling project  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:13:17):**  not necessarily the carbon modeling with the landowners because they have a imagining like  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:13:22):**  Robin said a lower they need less and they need anyway they need longer term but what's  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:13:27):**  the current status of the carbon project and what's still if something what's still missing  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:13:31):**  yeah right now we're working with large companies in our home country Estonia who wish to offset  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:13:37):**  their remaining emissions and why they also want to be part of this project is to help  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:13:43):**  local farmers in our home countries to do good and help them contribute to slowing down  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:13:49):**  climate change and removing carbon from circulation getting it back into the soil and keeping  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:13:55):**  it there and so they have committed to purchase the first few thousand credits coming out  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:14:01):**  of the pilot farmers this summer and then we plan to scale over summers as we get to  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:14:08):**  the harvest that after this summer's harvest a larger number of farmers which switch practices  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:14:15):**  having joined the program and then a year from now we can deliver the first carbon credits  
**[0:14:20-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:14:20):**  from this larger group initially in Poland Estonia and Latvia and we're targeting a couple  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:14:28):**  of hundred farms and over a hundred thousand hectares of grain land in this broader group  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:14:35):**  as we go now and what do you see maybe for Robin what as you're targeting specific farms  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:14:41):**  what is the criteria and what are the practices you let's say imagining with the farmers are  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:14:47):**  changing or how do you to help them speed up and thus capture more like what are the  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:14:51):**  main things that are different from the rest of the farmers you're working with yeah well  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:14:56):**  that's very interesting question because if you talk about carbon offsetting and carbon  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:01):**  credits and one of the challenges but it's it's really okay challenge and I think positive  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:06):**  problem to have still is that it's for good farmers it's very hard to produce carbon credits  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:12):**  so farmers who already capture carbon carbon credit in essence is something that has to  
**[0:15:17-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:17):**  be additional so no one should support if they want to offset their emissions then they  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:24):**  shouldn't support something that already happens it should be additional activity so you need  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:28):**  to work with the farmers that are not doing any of this or otherwise I've seen a picture  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:32):**  somewhere saying I you're only paying I think was in the US like as a joke but it's somehow  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:37):**  true I've been no-till and rotational for the last 15 years and I'm not part of cannot  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:42):**  be part of this program let me get my carbon D capture machine aka the plow and let's just  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:47):**  plow everything and start over which is of course what you don't want like that's the  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:51):**  risk we are running so how do you get around that exactly and that was a big challenge  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:57):**  we thought like many ways how we can like should we maybe put some of the car credits  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:16:01):**  aside that farms are generating and give it just to farmers who already do good and well  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:16:07):**  there were many thoughts that we had but in the end then we found or understood that there  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:16:12):**  are other ways how farmers can benefit from the carbon program for example selling low  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:16:17):**  carbon crops we are not offering this today but in the future that's one of the things  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:16:22):**  that we want to start offering and that farmers for example my father who is growing climate  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:16:27):**  positive crops so capturing more carbon than he's emitting with activities so that he could  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:16:32):**  get higher price for the grain that he is selling but at the same time if there is a  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:16:36):**  farmer doing a change in activities and starting capturing more carbon now then this farmer  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:16:42):**  has a choice either he or she can sell carbon credits away and then the farm balance would  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:16:48):**  be a negative again or he or she can get the higher price for grain so it's very important  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:16:54):**  to avoid double counting as well because otherwise let's say the big food company would say that  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:00):**  their scope 3 emissions are zero all farmers are carbon neutral but at the same time these  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:06):**  farmers are selling their credits away to Shell big oil company let's say and they say  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:12):**  that hey we are also carbon neutral so that's something that we have to avoid so in this  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:17):**  sense after understanding this then we feel now that it's the model really works so those  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:24):**  farmers should do already good get benefit from getting higher price for the grain or  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:29):**  even some other benefits as well and those farmers who are in the beginning of this journey  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:34):**  of going climate positive they can choose if they want to get higher price for the grain  
**[0:17:40-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:40):**  or sell their credits.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:41):**  You know I just wanted to add that this is also the way so there's a permanence concern  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:46):**  that is often asked so you know how do you know what is being put back in stays there  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:51):**  forever I think that's the definition of a carbon credit an offset so that it needs to  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:56):**  be a permanent change and one way of ensuring that is to continue so let's say we have the  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:02):**  ten year project timeline with farmers they establish their baseline and they apply new  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:08):**  practices start creating change they will be on a different trajectory then the ten  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:14):**  years is over last of the carbon offsets or removal units have been paid to them what  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:19):**  happens then and what we know how do we manage the risk of them not falling back to some  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:25):**  old practices and for example plowing again and that the same thing that Robin talked  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:29):**  about good farmers today will also apply in the future that we can work with those farmers  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:35):**  then ten years from now to continue sustainable practices beyond the life of the carbon project  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:42):**  and they will then be able to benefit from these sustainably farmed options where companies  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:49):**  will have demands to purchase their crops and reward them for the good practices especially  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:53):**  ten years from now this must be much more of a norm than it is today.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:58):**  The carbon paying is really a transition phase and we all need to work on making sure that  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:04):**  the market of ingredients of produce etc. starts rewarding low carbon or even carbon  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:10):**  positive crops and that's the long term carrot basically to keep everyone going apart from  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:16):**  lower costs and all the other incentives that hopefully makes the farm much more efficient  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:21):**  and effective but there it needs to come from the market at some point where they sell into  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:26):**  which is something you can start building and probably are like how do you connect the  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:30):**  best ingredients the best quality the best flavor but also the best carbon balance of  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:34):**  a ton of grain basically to a market buyer that is interested in that.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:38):**  Yeah absolutely and obviously some activities still will be considered as additional even  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:44):**  after 20 years some some activities that wouldn't be profitable without carbon credits but the  
**[0:19:50-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:50):**  goal is that after let's say three to five years we can arrange a very big party where  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:57):**  every shot that you take will capture also carbon so imagine this how good people would  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:03):**  feel partying over there.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:05):**  And how drunk they would get yeah.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:08):**  And just an idea what's your like the farms you work with now with a few thousand hectares  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:13):**  what are you seeing in terms of with this prime milk like the first phase in terms of  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:17):**  capture potential what do you see per hectare very different circumstances I imagine but  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:22):**  just as a range we talked about ranges before but what do you see as a range what is possible  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:26):**  because we see very different numbers around what have you seen in the field that is actually  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:31):**  doable.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:32):**  Yeah we've modeled many scenarios now and worked in detail with these first farmers  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:39):**  and what we are seeing is the range is somewhere between it really depends where the farmer  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:43):**  is coming from like what his baseline is and it's something between half a ton per hectare  
**[0:20:49-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:49):**  per year to one and a half to two times depending on which practices he's already applying.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:58):**  And then in addition to creating carbon credits or carbon offset units most farmers also benefit  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:05):**  from reduced amount of inputs so they will be using less fuel so fewer passes across  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:12):**  the field so there's some fuel savings and there is some savings from optimizing fertilizer  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:19):**  use and we see it's roughly 80-20 so about 80 percent of the benefit for the farmer is  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:26):**  coming from the carbon removal units and then 20 percent from reduced input costs.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:31):**  And do you see that happening and changing over time as well like if they're reducing  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:35):**  is there any difference between let's say very advanced ones that are have been working  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:40):**  the soil for a long time in a different way maybe like your father Robin that is already  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:45):**  carbon positive because I think he's been farming organic and beyond organic for a long  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:49):**  time do you see that like in that cohort that you're working with like the more extreme  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:53):**  ones are different there or what have you seen in the field with this few pilot farms  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:58):**  so far?  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:59):**  Yeah well if the time goes on and a farmer is continuing farming it this way then they  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:04):**  will see that there are many other benefits as well that it's harder to prove in paper.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:09):**  Biodiversity piece and yeah exactly exactly so let's say if you eat healthy then most  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:15):**  likely you won't get sick that much and same is true with the field and but it's really  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:21):**  well it's difficult to prove those benefits on the paper but it's easier to prove at first  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:28):**  benefits like hey you are reducing your fuel that much or red clover is capturing that  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:34):**  much nitrogen and you don't have to you can reduce the amount that you're putting again  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:38):**  saving some money and then we will pay this amount additionally and that's helping farmers  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:43):**  to make the change that's actually something to be taught as well that so current carbon  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:47):**  programs the contracts that we are signing with farmers are 10-year contracts so that's  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:52):**  a 10-year period and for the first period additional activity is whatever activity that  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:58):**  farmer wasn't doing previously so if farmer wasn't doing it then it's considered additional  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:04):**  but after this 10-year period additional activities will be only well something that farmer didn't  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:10):**  do even this last 10-year period and those that wouldn't be profitable without carbon  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:15):**  program because during this period we want to prove that actually several activities  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:20):**  were are profitable anyways for farmers.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:23):**  Even without the carbon piece yeah.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:26):**  But it's still additional because without this extra benefit from the carbon program  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:30):**  or extra money or extra income those farmers wouldn't be willing to make this change they  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:35):**  couldn't afford or they wouldn't hire someone like E-Agronom to guide them because with  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:41):**  every farmer we have also we give them agronomical advice how they can make this change and to  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:46):**  make sure that they benefit from this and they probably wouldn't be willing to take  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:50):**  the risk as well because with every risk like every farmer has well average person has 40  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:56):**  years career and farmers as well but the difference is that farmers getting feedback only once  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:02):**  a year so imagine if you would do podcast only once a year how much would you consider  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:08):**  before every question and everything you would say so that's the situation that farmers have  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:12):**  and that's why they're that risk averse but this carbon program helps them to make this  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:17):**  change and then after 10-year period they will find out that hey we should continue  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:22):**  those because they are profitable anyways.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:24):**  And do you see let's say any this ties perfectly in the risky part let's say the more the more  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:30):**  risky or the more adventurous pieces of carbon farming which you see in other places well  
**[0:24:35-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:35):**  like integration of animals very diverse cover crop mixes like 15-20 types we've seen around  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:42):**  maybe integration of trees as well into the fields is that something you imagine maybe  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:47):**  in year 8 or year 12 of the program with some adventurous farmers are people already asking  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:52):**  about that like is this going to enable some farmers that want to and are ready obviously  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:57):**  to take those kind of risks is that something you're thinking of or are we not there yet?  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:01):**  I think it really depends on the farmer but it's not considered we don't have this in  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:05):**  the financial plans our own financial plans but I personally believe that once farmers  
**[0:25:10-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:10):**  see the benefits from the carbon program then they want to go more and more this path so  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:18):**  using plants in the fields and so on this is something that we want to for sure research  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:24):**  and offer the farmers.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:26):**  Right now we are obviously doing like simple things reduce plowing use cover crops and  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:32):**  maybe something extra but once farmers see benefits and see that hey did that really  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:36):**  work then probably they're ready for the next step as well.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:40):**  And do you imagine any kind of let's say farming competition like between different farms who  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:46):**  can do the fastest build up of soil carbon without cheating and obviously getting a lot  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:50):**  of outside fertilization into or a lot of manure or a lot of compost?  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:54):**  That question is straight to the point because I think it's an international format soil  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:26:00):**  you're on this and the format of this competition is that you put your underwear not actually  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:26:06):**  your underwear that is from this specific natural material you bury it under the soil  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:26:12):**  and then after a few months you take it away and the more it's eaten by bacteria and basically  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:26:18):**  soil animals the more healthy your soil is and we started this competition in Estonia  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:26:25):**  and Poland and I think Latvia as well and you know what's crazy before this the hottest  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:26:30):**  competitions in farming were plowing competition who plows best the yield competition who gets  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:26:36):**  most yield out of this but now that's the hottest competition in farming in our region  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:26:42):**  right now.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:26:43):**  So randomly like this our sales guy posted this in Poland he was driving his daughter  
**[0:26:49-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:26:49):**  to the school and he heard national Polish radio nationwide radio speaking without our  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:26:57):**  initiative actually speaking about this competition that hey and about the importance of soil  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:02):**  health and same things happening in Estonia as well media is picking it up farmers are  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:06):**  sharing that they are burying their own undies and so on and that's really really cool to  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:11):**  see that the hottest competitions right now in the industry are not anymore plowing or  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:16):**  yield but it's soil health that's really cool.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:18):**  I will find a link it's really interesting how something silly it's almost silly between  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:23):**  brackets can really capture the imagination of farmers and I've seen it on people have  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:28):**  done it with tea bags as well to really see okay to have an easy measurement or an easy  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:33):**  proxy to see how fast does in these days cotton basically break down and does how healthy  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:38):**  is my soil everybody can do it it's funny enough to share but it gets right to the point  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:43):**  of how healthy how alive is your soil and I think some people will be in for a shock  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:48):**  and some others will be in for a nice surprise.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:52):**  And with that I want to be conscious of your time and talk a bit about the current fundraising  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:56):**  round you're doing like what are you I mean the reason you shared already you're in a  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:00):**  number of countries and you want to expand in those countries actually not necessarily  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:04):**  other countries but in the countries you're already active in what are you looking for  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:07):**  like what have you seen talking to a lot of investors over the last months is it different  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:12):**  than a year ago is it what have you felt basically in all those pitches obviously from a distance  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:17):**  because nobody's traveling what has been the interest from the investor world maybe the  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:21):**  traditional investor world as well into the topics of soil carbon into topics of agriculture  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:26):**  is there a lot of interest is there we still have to do a lot of work what do you see.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:30):**  Yeah that's an interesting question because well from one side carbon is very hot and  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:35):**  that's something that all VCs are telling as well that hey that's because we are we  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:41):**  are among the first movers in Europe with this as well in agricultural carbon offsetting  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:46):**  and that's really interesting for VCs.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:49):**  Now at the same time if we go deeper then it really depends the North American investors  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:54):**  know much more about this industry probably because it has been their longer time and  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:00):**  then if you come to Europe then that's really exciting but investors are currently in this  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:06):**  learning space that they're reading articles and just trying to understand where are the  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:12):**  challenges at what questions to ask and so on but there is interest absolutely but it's  
**[0:29:18-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:18):**  in the beginning.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:19):**  Yeah we as we talked to the funds in our data room we have a whole section for background  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:25):**  reading materials for you so then where we just keep compiling resources for them to  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:30):**  get up to speed and it's very interesting topic for them but they need to learn a lot  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:35):**  and they're looking for more information to understand the space better.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:39):**  And I can imagine that I mean it's great that you're doing all this education to investors  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:43):**  but at some point you would like the investment in the company and not just you're not an  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:47):**  education company you're a farming company and you need to get going but it's I mean  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:51):**  that's the pioneering rule as well like you're educating probably way more investors than  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:55):**  end up investing because they're maybe not comfortable yet with the whole topic and they  
**[0:30:00-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:00):**  it's the first time they hear a lot of things.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:01):**  I'm still amazed I think for how fast this topic has come to the forefront but how much  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:07):**  research people have to do to fully grasp it how many farms they need to visit how  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:10):**  much they have to understand how they have to read and yeah we're definitely in the  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:15):**  early days of that.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:16):**  And so you're currently raising your series A can you share a bit more on that?  
**[0:30:21-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:21):**  Yeah we are raising seven million euros as I said before you're scaling in some new markets  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:28):**  where we have customers but we don't have local sales force yet to accelerate the carbon  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:33):**  program and to scale it.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:35):**  We have proven the carbon program in the small scale and there is actually interesting is  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:41):**  that there are actually more interest from the farmer side than we can ourselves physically  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:46):**  manage but now we have to build some more technology behind there that we can scale  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:52):**  this part of the business as well.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:54):**  So that's one of the areas and then well the continuous product development as well.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:59):**  Yeah we are raising seven million we have a bit more than five million euros committed  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:04):**  already but we are currently in the process of choosing the lead investor.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:08):**  For the lead investor the main we have given up this dream that we would want someone who  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:13):**  knows more about farming and carbon business than we know.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:18):**  So that's not the main criteria for the investor.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:21):**  That slot is not available anymore for anybody listening so if they think they know more  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:25):**  they can get in touch but you've given up that dream but so what are you looking for  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:29):**  now?  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:30):**  Yeah so but we are looking mainly for well for VCs who help us to secure the series B  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:35):**  around.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:37):**  So we want to invest in series A they want to follow on in series B as well and get us  
**[0:31:43-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:43):**  behind the tables of really top notch investors over there.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:45):**  We have some great commitments already like founder of a former recall Transferwise now  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:52):**  it's called VICE.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:53):**  I'm a customer yeah they change the names over time yeah but a very very interesting  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:57):**  company.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:58):**  Unicorn I think they're valued at three billion or so well actually more there are rumors  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:02):**  about IPO and so on but another topic and obviously they will help with this exact topic  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:07):**  as well but yeah looking for lead and then from the following investors so that's why  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:13):**  we have actually quite a many following commitments.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:15):**  We try to choose VCs from different markets that are interesting for us because we see  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:20):**  that even if these VCs are not necessarily like with farming background they still have  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:25):**  access better access than we have to local media and some local contacts and so on and  
**[0:32:30-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:30):**  that's really helpful.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:31):**  Yeah so you don't have to rely only on burying underwear to get on the radio which is a great  
**[0:32:36-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:36):**  way but still yeah.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:37):**  It is it is a great way.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:39):**  So I want to be conscious of your time and thank you so much for this update I think  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:43):**  there a lot has happened in six months or less actually and very excited for your carbon  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:49):**  program and programs coming over the next years and obviously for all the work you have  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:54):**  been doing and like the farming season has started which means your growth season in  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:58):**  terms of new farmers has stopped but now you have to serve all the farmers that are in  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:33:01):**  the field planting, monitoring, modeling and all of that so I wish you a lot of luck with

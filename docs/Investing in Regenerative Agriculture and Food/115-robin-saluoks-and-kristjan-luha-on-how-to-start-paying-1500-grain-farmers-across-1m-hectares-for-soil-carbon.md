**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:14):**  An update with Robin and Christian of eAgonom who are working with 1500 grain farmers across  1 million hectares in Central and Eastern Europe and they are starting to pay farmers  for the carbon they capture.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:27):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if  the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:40-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:40):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:00:53):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small,  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:08):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:20):**  For more information on the different tiers, benefits and how to become a member check  gumroad.com slash investing region egg or find the link below.  Thank you.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:31):**  Welcome to another episode.  We have Robin and Christian back on the show.  In October 2020 we had a long talk about how to partner with farmers and technology and  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:39):**  today they're back and we're going to talk about why they're focusing on carbon.  So welcome Christian and Robin.  Hello.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:46):**  Hi, it's good to be back.  For anybody that didn't listen to the other show I will definitely put a link in the show  notes below but just Robin in two three sentences I mean you've been pitching so often now that  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:01:56):**  you for sure have memorized the best way to summarize eAgronom but just for anybody that  doesn't know what we're talking about what is eAgronom and then we get into the carbon  into your current round some updates but what is a good a good introduction into what you've  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:10):**  built over the last years?  Yeah absolutely.  Well eAgronom is number one farm management system in central east in Europe so farmers  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:18):**  use this to plan manage and analyze their activities and based on this data we also  give advice to farmers what crops to grow what tasks to do what fertilizers to use and  so on and the result of this is increased efficiency so higher profits and actually  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:33):**  also smaller carbon footprint but what makes eAgronom special is that in some cases instead  of farmers paying to us we are paying to farmers so they're benefiting from our carbon program  now and get paid for capturing carbon from the atmosphere into the soil.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:02:51):**  That's super exciting we're definitely going to unpack that but just to give a flavor of  what has happened since October you've grown a lot like how many farmers are you working  with right now we're talking April 2021 just give an understanding of how many farmers  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:04):**  and then of course the hectares that they represent.  Yeah we have about one and a half thousand farms on platform and they manage across this  fleet over a million hectares of grain lands we've recently expanded and made ourselves  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:20):**  available also in Australia our main markets here are here in central eastern Europe biggest  one is Poland, Estonia obviously where we're from as well Latvia we have some clients also  in Romania and Czech and in October we've grown about 50% since which is a good growth  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:39):**  season for us you know we can mostly recruit farmers when they're not on their fields and  that's after harvest and before spring so those have been a good five months for us.  Wow that's a good amount of hectares and you're currently obviously this is not investment  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:03:55):**  advice to anybody listening but I'm very interested in as the title of this podcast Investing  in Regenerative Agriculture and Food you're currently raising a round can you explain  share a bit more on that what you're looking for in terms of investors what you're finding  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:09):**  in the market like how is those discussions over the last six months have gone what are  you seeing in the market in terms of investors that are getting I think at least we see on  our side a lot more interest in the market but maybe a lot of people are new to the space  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:21):**  as well so what have been has been your experience in this latest funded raising round that you  are currently in the middle of?  Well first of all why do we need money right now at all?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:30):**  That's a very good question to start with Robin yeah.  Yeah well we are number one player in Poland, Estonia and Latvia and beside this we have  some first customers so we can't say we are in those markets but we are ready to start  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:04:44):**  scaling in those markets in four other markets including actually Australia but mainly in  Poland, Latvia and Estonia we have proved that the Archerum model works quite well so  our annual customer value is higher than the customer acquisition cost and so we are efficient  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:01):**  in recruiting new farmers to the platform we are also upselling the digital advisory  package and now bringing those farmers into carbon program but obviously those three markets  are not enough for changing the agriculture in total and that's why we need the financing  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:19):**  as well to scale to new markets mainly actually the markets where we already have some customer  base but then also to bring carbon program to these farmers so that they can benefit  from capturing more carbon into the soil, growing humus balances, reducing their own  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:35):**  emissions and etc.  We touched upon that carbon piece briefly last time we mostly looked at how your platform  and technology and software is helping to plan much better and work much more efficiently  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:05:47):**  and effectively to make sure that you don't get into you don't rotate yourself into problems  I think we mentioned specifically last time and I keep using that phrase which is very  interesting but the carbon piece I think has shifted quite a bit or has let's say accelerated  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:01):**  over the last months can you explain a bit everybody has seen probably the attention  or the hype we're going up to in terms of soil carbon but what is happening on the ground  with customers your farmers and then potentially other customers that are buying the carbon  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:14):**  the soil carbon of you what has been happening since October since we last spoke?  Absolutely well there are many ways how farmers can benefit from capturing carbon and reducing  their emissions and just to share the load let me explain the first example that we call  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:29):**  soil carbon and then Christian can explain about carbon offset units but with soil carbon  we have managed to successfully reduce the rent land rent of farmers who capture carbon  into the soil as you probably know then half of the land in Europe is not owned by farmers  
**[0:06:48-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:06:48):**  but rented to farmers 40% in North America so there are plenty of very big landowners  who are long-term investors and they want to make sure that their asset value is safe  in the long term now it's possible to farm in different ways you can farm in a way that  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:07):**  you have more carbon and more humus in the soil every year but you can also farm in a  way that you have less carbon and humus in the soil every year and based on this after  well 10 to 15 years the land value will be different if you capture more carbon to the  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:22):**  soil then you have more nutrients in the soil as well and the land value is higher.  Do you see that value already that connection between let's say the health of the soil and  the land value because that's a lot of discussion around that that maybe a lot of investors  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:35):**  don't recognize that or a lot of landowners and thus there's a disconnect between what  we see and what but you see you've been working with some landowners that do recognize that  healthy soils is in there in their benefit.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:07:47):**  Absolutely well the first landowner with whom we actually made this deal if they are valuing  how much they're ready to pay for a new land that they are buying they're actually looking  down they have a point system and one of the attributes over there is how much humus or  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:02):**  carbon organic carbon there is actually in the soil and it makes sense it really makes  sense and that's how we made a deal with them as well for their farmers farmers who rent  land from them they actually have 14,000 hectares but their farmers obviously have in total  
**[0:08:18-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:18):**  80,000 hectares so farmers who rent land from them and they now give a smaller rent to farmers  with positive humus balance so farmers who capture more carbon from the atmosphere to  the soil and higher rent for farmers who don't do it.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:34):**  And you manage that program for them for this landowner and these farmers are clients of  you as well and how do you manage that how do you measure that?  Yeah so over there we use models that are built by local scientists now if we move more  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:08:49):**  to the Christian what Christian will explain later about carbon offset units and carbon  offsetting there we use soil samples as well but models are okay for landowners for their  internal use if they trust the models enough then they trust that okay farmers are doing  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:03):**  those activities then their land quality in the future will be higher so models for them  are okay but if we talk about producing carbon credits then soil measuring to verify models  are very important as well.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:16):**  But in this case basically you're working with a large landowner and their farmers and  because you basically are the software for the farmers to manage their full operations  you know what they're doing or not doing in terms of plowing or plowing in terms of applying  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:32):**  certain things etc and they pay a lower rent to the landowner if they apply certain things  which is very interesting because of so longer term it's interesting for them because of  the cost so there's a very interesting relationship there very interesting incentive structure  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:46):**  that you have been able to build and you see that because you did one you see that being  interesting for other you see an interest from other landowners.  Yeah we made this deal with a biggest landowner in Estonia and we're currently discussing  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:09:58):**  with very big landlord in Poland as well but in the end as you said everybody wins so farmer  gets to pay smaller land rent and actually the farm gets more efficient as well but that's  the secondary benefit then a landowner gets to make sure that their asset value is safe  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:10:14):**  in the long term and then the economy gets both FMS fee and then verification fee from  the landowner.  We get a small fee from both sides which is very interesting and then Christian to you  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:10:24):**  then there's the option to potentially sell these carbon credits with a few extra questions  obviously around measurement and around outcome etc what's been happening there?  Yeah that opportunity is definitely there but creating carbon credits in farming in  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:10:39):**  itself is not even the main goal the main goal is to create an extra source of revenue  for the farmer and if we look if we zoom out a bit farming generally is capital intensive  so there's high costs involved but margins are not very high and unpredictability is  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:11:00):**  increasing so there are more and more years where surprises happen extreme weather events  bad yields low yields so farmers struggle a bit more than they used to and well and  on the other side farming is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions globally then  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:11:18):**  where the opportunity comes in is now on a global level I think the awareness of climate  change and the need to do something about it is growing there's Paris climate agreement  if you look around many countries and large corporations have committed to become net  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:11:35):**  zero over the next 20 or 30 years and to significantly reduce their emissions and offset the rest  and farming is an opportunity because soils are a large carbon sink so that's where we  believe farmers can come in and while they continue doing what they do growing crops  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:11:55):**  and feeding the people we can also create an additional source of income here through  carbon offsets or carbon removal units and that's the path we've embarked on right now  with a small selection of farmers in Estonia and Poland there's a few thousand hectares  
**[0:12:15-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:12:15):**  today piloting based on our methodology we follow FAO guidelines and Rotham see soil  sampling models we also work with local scientists to localize the models to local conditions  the soils are different and what are conditions are different in each of the countries so  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:12:37):**  we have we do want to make sure we maintain high standards and and meet the highest expectations  in terms of methodology project requirements and then how do we establish the baseline  how do we model the outcomes and then verify the projected outcomes through soil testing  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:12:57):**  regularly and how far are you in a sense what's missing or where are you already at like let's  say a big buyer I mean one of the big ones that has mentioned or smaller ones that said  I want to be net positive by this year so I need to offset or remove if they knock on  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:13:12):**  the door maybe they already have like what's the current status of the carbon selling project  not necessarily the carbon modeling with the landowners because they have a imagining like  Robin said a lower they need less and they need anyway they need longer term but what's  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:13:27):**  the current status of the carbon project and what's still if something what's still missing  yeah right now we're working with large companies in our home country Estonia who wish to offset  their remaining emissions and why they also want to be part of this project is to help  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:13:43):**  local farmers in our home countries to do good and help them contribute to slowing down  climate change and removing carbon from circulation getting it back into the soil and keeping  it there and so they have committed to purchase the first few thousand credits coming out  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:14:01):**  of the pilot farmers this summer and then we plan to scale over summers as we get to  the harvest that after this summer's harvest a larger number of farmers which switch practices  having joined the program and then a year from now we can deliver the first carbon credits  
**[0:14:20-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:14:20):**  from this larger group initially in Poland Estonia and Latvia and we're targeting a couple  of hundred farms and over a hundred thousand hectares of grain land in this broader group  as we go now and what do you see maybe for Robin what as you're targeting specific farms  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:14:41):**  what is the criteria and what are the practices you let's say imagining with the farmers are  changing or how do you to help them speed up and thus capture more like what are the  main things that are different from the rest of the farmers you're working with yeah well  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:14:56):**  that's very interesting question because if you talk about carbon offsetting and carbon  credits and one of the challenges but it's it's really okay challenge and I think positive  problem to have still is that it's for good farmers it's very hard to produce carbon credits  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:12):**  so farmers who already capture carbon carbon credit in essence is something that has to  be additional so no one should support if they want to offset their emissions then they  shouldn't support something that already happens it should be additional activity so you need  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:28):**  to work with the farmers that are not doing any of this or otherwise I've seen a picture  somewhere saying I you're only paying I think was in the US like as a joke but it's somehow  true I've been no-till and rotational for the last 15 years and I'm not part of cannot  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:42):**  be part of this program let me get my carbon D capture machine aka the plow and let's just  plow everything and start over which is of course what you don't want like that's the  risk we are running so how do you get around that exactly and that was a big challenge  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:15:57):**  we thought like many ways how we can like should we maybe put some of the car credits  aside that farms are generating and give it just to farmers who already do good and well  there were many thoughts that we had but in the end then we found or understood that there  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:16:12):**  are other ways how farmers can benefit from the carbon program for example selling low  carbon crops we are not offering this today but in the future that's one of the things  that we want to start offering and that farmers for example my father who is growing climate  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:16:27):**  positive crops so capturing more carbon than he's emitting with activities so that he could  get higher price for the grain that he is selling but at the same time if there is a  farmer doing a change in activities and starting capturing more carbon now then this farmer  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:16:42):**  has a choice either he or she can sell carbon credits away and then the farm balance would  be a negative again or he or she can get the higher price for grain so it's very important  to avoid double counting as well because otherwise let's say the big food company would say that  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:00):**  their scope 3 emissions are zero all farmers are carbon neutral but at the same time these  farmers are selling their credits away to Shell big oil company let's say and they say  that hey we are also carbon neutral so that's something that we have to avoid so in this  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:17):**  sense after understanding this then we feel now that it's the model really works so those  farmers should do already good get benefit from getting higher price for the grain or  even some other benefits as well and those farmers who are in the beginning of this journey  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:34):**  of going climate positive they can choose if they want to get higher price for the grain  or sell their credits.  You know I just wanted to add that this is also the way so there's a permanence concern  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:17:46):**  that is often asked so you know how do you know what is being put back in stays there  forever I think that's the definition of a carbon credit an offset so that it needs to  be a permanent change and one way of ensuring that is to continue so let's say we have the  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:02):**  ten year project timeline with farmers they establish their baseline and they apply new  practices start creating change they will be on a different trajectory then the ten  years is over last of the carbon offsets or removal units have been paid to them what  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:19):**  happens then and what we know how do we manage the risk of them not falling back to some  old practices and for example plowing again and that the same thing that Robin talked  about good farmers today will also apply in the future that we can work with those farmers  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:35):**  then ten years from now to continue sustainable practices beyond the life of the carbon project  and they will then be able to benefit from these sustainably farmed options where companies  will have demands to purchase their crops and reward them for the good practices especially  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:18:53):**  ten years from now this must be much more of a norm than it is today.  The carbon paying is really a transition phase and we all need to work on making sure that  the market of ingredients of produce etc. starts rewarding low carbon or even carbon  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:10):**  positive crops and that's the long term carrot basically to keep everyone going apart from  lower costs and all the other incentives that hopefully makes the farm much more efficient  and effective but there it needs to come from the market at some point where they sell into  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:26):**  which is something you can start building and probably are like how do you connect the  best ingredients the best quality the best flavor but also the best carbon balance of  a ton of grain basically to a market buyer that is interested in that.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:38):**  Yeah absolutely and obviously some activities still will be considered as additional even  after 20 years some some activities that wouldn't be profitable without carbon credits but the  goal is that after let's say three to five years we can arrange a very big party where  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:19:57):**  every shot that you take will capture also carbon so imagine this how good people would  feel partying over there.  And how drunk they would get yeah.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:08):**  And just an idea what's your like the farms you work with now with a few thousand hectares  what are you seeing in terms of with this prime milk like the first phase in terms of  capture potential what do you see per hectare very different circumstances I imagine but  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:22):**  just as a range we talked about ranges before but what do you see as a range what is possible  because we see very different numbers around what have you seen in the field that is actually  doable.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:32):**  Yeah we've modeled many scenarios now and worked in detail with these first farmers  and what we are seeing is the range is somewhere between it really depends where the farmer  is coming from like what his baseline is and it's something between half a ton per hectare  
**[0:20:49-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:20:49):**  per year to one and a half to two times depending on which practices he's already applying.  And then in addition to creating carbon credits or carbon offset units most farmers also benefit  from reduced amount of inputs so they will be using less fuel so fewer passes across  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:12):**  the field so there's some fuel savings and there is some savings from optimizing fertilizer  use and we see it's roughly 80-20 so about 80 percent of the benefit for the farmer is  coming from the carbon removal units and then 20 percent from reduced input costs.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:31):**  And do you see that happening and changing over time as well like if they're reducing  is there any difference between let's say very advanced ones that are have been working  the soil for a long time in a different way maybe like your father Robin that is already  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:45):**  carbon positive because I think he's been farming organic and beyond organic for a long  time do you see that like in that cohort that you're working with like the more extreme  ones are different there or what have you seen in the field with this few pilot farms  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:21:58):**  so far?  Yeah well if the time goes on and a farmer is continuing farming it this way then they  will see that there are many other benefits as well that it's harder to prove in paper.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:09):**  Biodiversity piece and yeah exactly exactly so let's say if you eat healthy then most  likely you won't get sick that much and same is true with the field and but it's really  well it's difficult to prove those benefits on the paper but it's easier to prove at first  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:28):**  benefits like hey you are reducing your fuel that much or red clover is capturing that  much nitrogen and you don't have to you can reduce the amount that you're putting again  saving some money and then we will pay this amount additionally and that's helping farmers  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:43):**  to make the change that's actually something to be taught as well that so current carbon  programs the contracts that we are signing with farmers are 10-year contracts so that's  a 10-year period and for the first period additional activity is whatever activity that  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:22:58):**  farmer wasn't doing previously so if farmer wasn't doing it then it's considered additional  but after this 10-year period additional activities will be only well something that farmer didn't  do even this last 10-year period and those that wouldn't be profitable without carbon  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:15):**  program because during this period we want to prove that actually several activities  were are profitable anyways for farmers.  Even without the carbon piece yeah.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:26):**  But it's still additional because without this extra benefit from the carbon program  or extra money or extra income those farmers wouldn't be willing to make this change they  couldn't afford or they wouldn't hire someone like E-Agronom to guide them because with  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:41):**  every farmer we have also we give them agronomical advice how they can make this change and to  make sure that they benefit from this and they probably wouldn't be willing to take  the risk as well because with every risk like every farmer has well average person has 40  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:23:56):**  years career and farmers as well but the difference is that farmers getting feedback only once  a year so imagine if you would do podcast only once a year how much would you consider  before every question and everything you would say so that's the situation that farmers have  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:12):**  and that's why they're that risk averse but this carbon program helps them to make this  change and then after 10-year period they will find out that hey we should continue  those because they are profitable anyways.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:24):**  And do you see let's say any this ties perfectly in the risky part let's say the more the more  risky or the more adventurous pieces of carbon farming which you see in other places well  like integration of animals very diverse cover crop mixes like 15-20 types we've seen around  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:42):**  maybe integration of trees as well into the fields is that something you imagine maybe  in year 8 or year 12 of the program with some adventurous farmers are people already asking  about that like is this going to enable some farmers that want to and are ready obviously  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:24:57):**  to take those kind of risks is that something you're thinking of or are we not there yet?  I think it really depends on the farmer but it's not considered we don't have this in  the financial plans our own financial plans but I personally believe that once farmers  
**[0:25:10-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:10):**  see the benefits from the carbon program then they want to go more and more this path so  using plants in the fields and so on this is something that we want to for sure research  and offer the farmers.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:26):**  Right now we are obviously doing like simple things reduce plowing use cover crops and  maybe something extra but once farmers see benefits and see that hey did that really  work then probably they're ready for the next step as well.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:40):**  And do you imagine any kind of let's say farming competition like between different farms who  can do the fastest build up of soil carbon without cheating and obviously getting a lot  of outside fertilization into or a lot of manure or a lot of compost?  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:25:54):**  That question is straight to the point because I think it's an international format soil  you're on this and the format of this competition is that you put your underwear not actually  your underwear that is from this specific natural material you bury it under the soil  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:26:12):**  and then after a few months you take it away and the more it's eaten by bacteria and basically  soil animals the more healthy your soil is and we started this competition in Estonia  and Poland and I think Latvia as well and you know what's crazy before this the hottest  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:26:30):**  competitions in farming were plowing competition who plows best the yield competition who gets  most yield out of this but now that's the hottest competition in farming in our region  right now.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:26:43):**  So randomly like this our sales guy posted this in Poland he was driving his daughter  to the school and he heard national Polish radio nationwide radio speaking without our  initiative actually speaking about this competition that hey and about the importance of soil  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:02):**  health and same things happening in Estonia as well media is picking it up farmers are  sharing that they are burying their own undies and so on and that's really really cool to  see that the hottest competitions right now in the industry are not anymore plowing or  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:16):**  yield but it's soil health that's really cool.  I will find a link it's really interesting how something silly it's almost silly between  brackets can really capture the imagination of farmers and I've seen it on people have  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:28):**  done it with tea bags as well to really see okay to have an easy measurement or an easy  proxy to see how fast does in these days cotton basically break down and does how healthy  is my soil everybody can do it it's funny enough to share but it gets right to the point  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:43):**  of how healthy how alive is your soil and I think some people will be in for a shock  and some others will be in for a nice surprise.  And with that I want to be conscious of your time and talk a bit about the current fundraising  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:27:56):**  round you're doing like what are you I mean the reason you shared already you're in a  number of countries and you want to expand in those countries actually not necessarily  other countries but in the countries you're already active in what are you looking for  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:07):**  like what have you seen talking to a lot of investors over the last months is it different  than a year ago is it what have you felt basically in all those pitches obviously from a distance  because nobody's traveling what has been the interest from the investor world maybe the  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:21):**  traditional investor world as well into the topics of soil carbon into topics of agriculture  is there a lot of interest is there we still have to do a lot of work what do you see.  Yeah that's an interesting question because well from one side carbon is very hot and  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:35):**  that's something that all VCs are telling as well that hey that's because we are we  are among the first movers in Europe with this as well in agricultural carbon offsetting  and that's really interesting for VCs.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:28:49):**  Now at the same time if we go deeper then it really depends the North American investors  know much more about this industry probably because it has been their longer time and  then if you come to Europe then that's really exciting but investors are currently in this  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:06):**  learning space that they're reading articles and just trying to understand where are the  challenges at what questions to ask and so on but there is interest absolutely but it's  in the beginning.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:19):**  Yeah we as we talked to the funds in our data room we have a whole section for background  reading materials for you so then where we just keep compiling resources for them to  get up to speed and it's very interesting topic for them but they need to learn a lot  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:35):**  and they're looking for more information to understand the space better.  And I can imagine that I mean it's great that you're doing all this education to investors  but at some point you would like the investment in the company and not just you're not an  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:29:47):**  education company you're a farming company and you need to get going but it's I mean  that's the pioneering rule as well like you're educating probably way more investors than  end up investing because they're maybe not comfortable yet with the whole topic and they  
**[0:30:00-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:00):**  it's the first time they hear a lot of things.  I'm still amazed I think for how fast this topic has come to the forefront but how much  research people have to do to fully grasp it how many farms they need to visit how  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:10):**  much they have to understand how they have to read and yeah we're definitely in the  early days of that.  And so you're currently raising your series A can you share a bit more on that?  
**[0:30:21-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:21):**  Yeah we are raising seven million euros as I said before you're scaling in some new markets  where we have customers but we don't have local sales force yet to accelerate the carbon  program and to scale it.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:35):**  We have proven the carbon program in the small scale and there is actually interesting is  that there are actually more interest from the farmer side than we can ourselves physically  manage but now we have to build some more technology behind there that we can scale  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:30:52):**  this part of the business as well.  So that's one of the areas and then well the continuous product development as well.  Yeah we are raising seven million we have a bit more than five million euros committed  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:04):**  already but we are currently in the process of choosing the lead investor.  For the lead investor the main we have given up this dream that we would want someone who  knows more about farming and carbon business than we know.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:18):**  So that's not the main criteria for the investor.  That slot is not available anymore for anybody listening so if they think they know more  they can get in touch but you've given up that dream but so what are you looking for  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:29):**  now?  Yeah so but we are looking mainly for well for VCs who help us to secure the series B  around.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:37):**  So we want to invest in series A they want to follow on in series B as well and get us  behind the tables of really top notch investors over there.  We have some great commitments already like founder of a former recall Transferwise now  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:52):**  it's called VICE.  I'm a customer yeah they change the names over time yeah but a very very interesting  company.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:31:58):**  Unicorn I think they're valued at three billion or so well actually more there are rumors  about IPO and so on but another topic and obviously they will help with this exact topic  as well but yeah looking for lead and then from the following investors so that's why  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:13):**  we have actually quite a many following commitments.  We try to choose VCs from different markets that are interesting for us because we see  that even if these VCs are not necessarily like with farming background they still have  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:25):**  access better access than we have to local media and some local contacts and so on and  that's really helpful.  Yeah so you don't have to rely only on burying underwear to get on the radio which is a great  
**[0:32:36-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:36):**  way but still yeah.  It is it is a great way.  So I want to be conscious of your time and thank you so much for this update I think  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:43):**  there a lot has happened in six months or less actually and very excited for your carbon  program and programs coming over the next years and obviously for all the work you have  been doing and like the farming season has started which means your growth season in  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:32:58):**  terms of new farmers has stopped but now you have to serve all the farmers that are in  the field planting, monitoring, modeling and all of that so I wish you a lot of luck with  that.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:33:07):**  Thank you.  Thanks Foon.  If you would like to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and

**[0:35:06-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:35:06):**  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:35:11):**  You the soil builders and investors in the space.  The soil builders, people working in the space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle  builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies,  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:35:24):**  permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:35:37):**  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  etc.  Is this course free?  
**[0:35:44-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:35:44):**  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:35:53):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:36:05):**  Thank you.  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:36:14-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:36:14):**  so you don't have to ride along.  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:36:26):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:36:37):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  
**[0:36:47-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:36:47):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/robin-saluoks-kristjan-luha-2#t=0:36:55):**  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

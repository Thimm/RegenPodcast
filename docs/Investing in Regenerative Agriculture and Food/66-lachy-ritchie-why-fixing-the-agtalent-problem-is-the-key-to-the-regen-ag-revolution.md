**[0:00:14-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:00:14):**  This interview is about talent and why it is such a crucial piece of the Regen ag revolution.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:00:21):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:00:25):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:00:27):**  Today I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space to learn more on  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:00:32):**  how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:00:38):**  while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:00:41):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:00:43):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:00:47):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:00:50):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:00:54):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:00:59):**  In March last year we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:01:24):**  Welcome to another episode today with Locky Ritchie, farmland portfolio manager of Wide  
**[0:01:29-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:01:29):**  Open Agriculture, co-founder of Ag Talent.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:01:31):**  Ag Talent is a search engine for training jobs and experts in the sustainable and regenerative  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:01:36):**  agriculture industry.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:01:38):**  Welcome Locky.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:01:39):**  Thanks Colin, pleasure.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:01:40):**  So to start with the usual personal question, how did you end up founding an Ag Talent platform  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:01:47):**  but how did you end up in farming in Ag in regenerative agriculture and soil?  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:01:51):**  Sure mate.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:01:52):**  Well I grew up farming, so broad acre farming in a variety of different contexts but like  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:01:59):**  many young people growing up in the land, we sold up our farm when I was about 12 years  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:04):**  old, kept working in Ag right up until my early 20s but I guess at least in the region  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:09):**  where I grew up, if you're a young person working in farming and you don't stand a chance  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:13):**  to inherit a farm, you're not really actively encouraged to pursue Ag as a career.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:19):**  You're very much encouraged to head off to the city which is exactly what I did.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:24):**  So yes, I basically left the farm early 20s, went to the city, went to university and I  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:29):**  found myself into the social enterprise pathway.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:33):**  So ended up over a period of 10 years co-founding three different social enterprises, completely  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:40):**  unrelated to Ag and throughâ€¦  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:44):**  Everything is related to Ag.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:45):**  I'm joking.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:46):**  No, totally man.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:47):**  Good point.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:48):**  It is.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:49):**  It is in one way or another and look, especially when you start to look at social enterprise  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:52):**  and you start to think about making a positive impact on the world and it's like the further  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:02:56):**  you go up the chain, it always comes back to environment, climate change and then the  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:03:01):**  food we eat is one of the biggest impact areas in that.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:03:05):**  So look, I guess after 10 years in the city and on this social enterprise pathway through  
**[0:03:12-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:03:12):**  a bit of serendipity and life's interesting journey, so my partner and I had the chance  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:03:19):**  to manage a small farm and it turns out the small farm was owned by two of Australia's  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:03:25):**  leading impact investors and our goal on that farm was to help to set up a small scale intensive  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:03:31):**  market garden with a couple of really talented growers and I guess over that two year period  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:03:37):**  that we spent on that time, I physically dove into the world of agriculture and regenerative  
**[0:03:42-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:03:42):**  agriculture in particular coming from my social enterprise background and realizing that from  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:03:50):**  an impact perspective, I now believe and understand quite clearly that I don't think there is  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:03:55):**  anywhere else dollar for dollar that you can have a greater impact on the world than the  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:01):**  food system, particularly when it comes to climate change.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:04):**  So it really was two years spent physically diving into the soil and tangibly understanding  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:10):**  it again and just I guess being reawakened to agriculture and the potential for agriculture.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:17):**  It wasn't the ag I grew up with, which was large broad scale very conventional agriculture.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:23):**  It was a real awakening for me and just understanding that I don't think there's anywhere you can  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:30):**  have greater impact than in agriculture.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:35):**  And I want to unpack that a bit.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:37):**  You mentioned and I think the first sentence or second sentence, as many born on the land  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:43):**  but not in a position to inherit, we were definitely not encouraged to stay on the land  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:48):**  and encouraged to go to the city.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:49):**  I see that in many, many places.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:51):**  But how does that non encouragement or encouragement to go to the city and non encouragement to  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:56):**  stay in farming?  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:57):**  How does that happen?  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:04:58):**  What should I as somebody that was born in the city should imagine basically the push  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:03):**  to please don't stay in farming and please move to the city?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:08):**  It's really subtle from it's well, sometimes not so subtle when you're sitting in a careers  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:14):**  council meeting at high school and they're just basically saying, you know, why on earth  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:18):**  would you want to be a farmer?  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:19):**  There's no money in that.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:20):**  There's no future in that.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:21):**  If you don't own that's not subtle at all.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:25):**  And look, to be honest, if you're quite good at school, the encouragement is, you know,  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:28):**  it's the classic, it's golf to university, become a lawyer, do medicine, become an engineer,  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:33):**  do something that's like, you know, guaranteed high paid job kind of thing.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:37):**  So there's a lot of that kind of permeated through us, at least, at least, you know,  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:41):**  coming from my own personal experience in the school system to encourage that people  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:47):**  go off to university and get, you know, the highest formal training they can and that  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:52):**  farming is, you know, potentially a backup.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:05:55):**  And it's not, you know, it's just not painted as a big, sexy, high profile career in the  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:06:01):**  same way that a lot of other industries are painted.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:06:05):**  You know, at least again, coming from my own personal experience.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:06:09):**  And that awakening moment, which happened over those two years in region ag, in this  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:06:14):**  case, in the market garden, that must have switched completely your idea of the sexy  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:06:20):**  job you maybe wanted to do the rest of your life.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:06:24):**  Yeah, it was, it was huge, I think just, obviously, you know, my having spent 10 years in the  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:06:31):**  world of social impact and impact investment and understanding how that whole sector is  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:06:37):**  working and evolving, and just suddenly realizing that, oh, wait, this like, this thing that  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:06:42):**  I grew up with and took for granted is, you know, it can, it can be hugely impactful.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:06:49):**  It was, yeah, it was a really big turning point for me.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:06:52):**  And what made you decide to take over and manage that farm?  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:06:55):**  Because you're working in social enterprises, but probably could have done that for a long  
**[0:06:59-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:06:59):**  time.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:00):**  But what was your moment?  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:01):**  Where was one of the social enterprises involved in food?  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:04):**  And I mentioned actually not?  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:05):**  And how did you cut back to food and ag but very different ag and where you grew up?  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:10):**  Because at some point, you had to leave the city and take over this farm?  
**[0:07:13-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:13):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:14):**  So it was a bit of so the love of my life, my now wife, Jess, she basically had the opportunity  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:22):**  to move over to the other side of the country for a new job opportunity.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:27):**  It was outside of the cities and, you know, wanting to support her in that and interested  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:31):**  in a change.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:32):**  I went along for the ride, basically.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:34):**  And then we found ourselves on the other side of the country, which was, you know, back  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:38):**  in the state where I where I grew up.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:41):**  And yeah, just through a series of serendipitous events, we actually, it actually kind of happened  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:50):**  because we went to a farm gate to buy some vegetables.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:07:55):**  And I bumped in and I saw the guy who owned the farm who's Daniel McGaur and Barry Lieberman  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:01):**  who are the their family offices, small giants.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:04):**  And I'd actually met Danny previously at a conference.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:07):**  And I literally walking into his farm to buy some vegetables.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:10):**  And we bumped into each other.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:11):**  And we knew we had that moment of recognition of like, how do we know?  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:16):**  Yeah, and then honestly, that sort of from then he took us on a tour of the farm.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:22):**  And then a few weeks later, basically called and said, you know, what are you doing when  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:26):**  when are you moving over to you?  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:29):**  You know, and he initially tried to recruit my wife.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:32):**  Danny can be quite persuasive.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:34):**  And look, you know, he tried to recruit my wife because she's trained in horticulture.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:38):**  And I kind of just weaseled my way in there and said, well, you know, and the opportunity  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:42):**  eventually added for me to be involved as well.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:44):**  So we both basically took on the roles caretaker of the farm and then progressively were joined  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:50):**  by some really talented people.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:52):**  And it was turned into an amazing little community of people that are working to make like the  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:08:57):**  farm what it is today, which is pretty impressive now.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:00):**  And it could have stopped there in a sense that you could have managed market gardens,  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:04):**  or you in plural, actually the rest of your life, but it didn't.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:08):**  You moved on to a very different project.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:10):**  I mean, still in the region, it's based with a very different scale, wide open egg, and  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:15):**  found co founding egg talent.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:17):**  Can you share a bit how that came about?  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:20):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:21):**  And I think, you know, in that journey as well for that that few years, I really recognized  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:25):**  that my my skill and I guess my passion is more around the startup phase of businesses  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:31):**  and enterprises.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:33):**  And that's really where I've kind of honed my Yeah, my passion.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:36):**  And on the farm, we're working with a couple of very skilled and talented growers.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:41):**  So Mikey and Kez from Mossy Willow Farm, just to give a little bit of plug there.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:46):**  They are amazing, are amazing growers.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:48):**  And there's really that recognition that my space is helping with the start and there's  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:52):**  no real need for me to carry on beyond that point.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:09:57):**  But also within that journey of being on that farm, we hosted interns, and we started running  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:03):**  internship programs.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:05):**  And there was these incredibly talented, skilled young people coming from the city who were  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:12):**  absolutely relishing in the chance to get involved in ag.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:16):**  And they were working hard.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:17):**  So they kind of blew a few of these stereotypes apart, we would expect people coming from  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:21):**  the city to not be able to work hard and don't really know what working is.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:25):**  And they just completely  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:27):**  I visit a farm and I stay with friends, etc.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:29):**  I always realize how hard it physically actually is.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:32):**  I don't think most people in the city have an idea except for the ones that really dive  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:35):**  in, like, like the ones you mentioned, the interns that really spent two, three years,  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:40):**  and they know what they're talking about.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:42):**  Most of us, I'm claiming us as a city city folks have no idea how physically it can be.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:48):**  Yeah, and this was, you know, this is a very small scale intensive market garden growing  
**[0:10:55-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:55):**  on one acre.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:10:57):**  So everything is manual, and they would work incredibly hard through the hot summer.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:02):**  And they were just basically coming out of the end of this internship program and going  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:06):**  like, where to now?  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:09):**  You know, what like, what are their options if they were loved the work loved the agriculture  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:15):**  love the potential impact of regenerative ag and really understood that mainly from  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:19):**  a climate change impact.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:22):**  But there was just nowhere for them to go.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:24):**  Like there was no structured pathway, you know, like, oh, next, you do this, and then  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:27):**  you do this, and then you do that.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:29):**  And then you get this training, and then these job opportunities open up.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:33):**  So just realizing how fragmented and non existent that career path is, particularly in the niche  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:41):**  of regenerative ag.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:43):**  So that was like the I guess, the intern and young person side of the story, which obviously  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:48):**  really resonated with my personal experience growing up, just around it, you know, not  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:53):**  being credible, or structured career path, particularly, yeah, like I said, in this alternative  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:11:59):**  side of agriculture.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:02):**  And then the other side of it was working with the small giants family office and realizing  
**[0:12:10-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:10):**  that obviously, from an impact investors perspective, regenerative ag is climbing on the agenda  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:17):**  of impact investment offices are now realized worldwide, and is a really hot topic.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:22):**  Luckily, I mean, they're, they're starting to listen more and more to the podcast.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:25):**  But yeah, it's been it's been a journey.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:26):**  But I see a lot of investors coming from mainly from the climate change angle now coming to  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:31):**  the space into soil, and realizing it's one of those great potentials.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:35):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:37):**  Realizing it's, you know, it could be huge.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:40):**  And Danny and Barry from small giants were, you know, the whole time we're down on the  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:44):**  farm, there's just constant discussions and philosophy around how do we how do we grow  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:48):**  this movement?  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:49):**  How do we see more investment flow in the right direction?  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:52):**  And I was realizing through those investor conversations, and with other groups as well,  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:12:58):**  that one of the big barriers to deals getting over the line often actually comes down to  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:03):**  talent.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:04):**  So it was it was coming up as a repeat problem within the investment space of succession  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:10):**  planning and finding appropriate farm managers.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:13):**  So there was kind of I'm seeing these like two sides of the problem of, you know, the  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:18):**  group trying to hire people, and then the young people trying to get jobs, and they're  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:22):**  just being this big void of disconnect and fragmentation in between.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:27):**  And it was kind of from that, that the idea for Ag talent was born.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:31):**  And can you describe a bit what is Ag talent?  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:33):**  I mean, I did it is a search engine, etc.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:36):**  But I'm sure there are a few more lines and a few more structure of what Ag talent is  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:41):**  at the moment and what it wants to be or will be in the near future.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:45):**  Sure.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:46):**  So yeah, basically, it is a search engine for jobs, training, and experts.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:52):**  And so how that works from the training side of things, if you can imagine an Airbnb style  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:13:57):**  marketplace, where you can go to one website, and all the best training from all over the  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:03):**  world to do with sustainable regenerative Ag is all on the one place, you can buy tickets,  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:08):**  you can compare, you can see ratings and reviews.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:11):**  And then the extension of that is that if you participate in training, you can create  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:16):**  yourself a profile a little bit like an online CV.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:20):**  And then you know, as we develop features in the platform, we'll be able to suggest  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:24):**  further training for you, potentially, you could rack up points and earn credits for  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:29):**  doing training.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:30):**  And then that obviously will give us as a platform, a big database of people who are  
**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:36):**  participating in training in the region Ag space.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:39):**  And then we'll be able to match those people to jobs.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:42):**  So then obviously, the job side of the platform is pretty straightforward at this point, it's  
**[0:14:46-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:46):**  a jobs board.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:47):**  So we've got jobs coming up all over the world again, all focusing on sustainable region  
**[0:14:52-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:52):**  Ag.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:54):**  And then the third part of the platform, which is, which is quite interesting is this expert  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:14:59):**  marketplace.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:01):**  So it's basically a place where experts either as individual independent consultants, or  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:08):**  organizations, consultancies, training orgs, all have little business profiles and can  
**[0:15:13-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:13):**  showcase their team, their talent, their skills, and also link through their training programs  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:20):**  as well.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:21):**  The dream as well is to have online coaching available with some of these consultants worldwide.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:26):**  And I guess just have a really tight delivery of training.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:29):**  I mean, it seems like you're almost finding three different businesses, but actually,  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:33):**  they're all very tightly connected.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:35):**  How has it been going?  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:36):**  Because I think you've been active for not extremely long.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:40):**  How has been the response?  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:41):**  What are surprises?  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:42):**  How has it been with the launch of this talent platform?  
**[0:15:45-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:45):**  Sure.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:46):**  So look, we, we've been working on this for about 12 months now.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:50):**  We received some startup funding about three, four months ago.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:54):**  And so we're really in the kind of final stages of developing what we'll call the platform  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:15:59):**  stage one.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:01):**  And then then we really go into now just a validation stage.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:05):**  And you know, can we get enough traffic and traction on the platform to make it make it  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:09):**  viable?  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:10):**  Like early signs are incredibly encouraging.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:12):**  Like you know, like I said, we still haven't released the completed version.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:17):**  And I think we're three and a half thousand views in the last 28 days on the website.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:22):**  So look, it's climbing like that's very encouraging for us.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:27):**  Probably the biggest surprise is how readily training organizations and consultancies want  
**[0:16:34-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:34):**  to get on board.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:35):**  So we're actually finding that, that yes, some leading training and consulting organizations  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:41):**  are keen to get on board and not only that, they want to promote and advocate for our  
**[0:16:45-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:45):**  platform.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:46):**  So it's been this real kind of almost, ah, finally someone's looking at this issue coming  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:53):**  from the experts within the industry.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:55):**  Yeah, because it's extremely fragmented until now.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:16:58):**  And if you're, I mean, everybody can call themselves an expert.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:02):**  And I'm imagining what the best one sees is the potential for the reviews and potential  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:07):**  for actually creating a name by something independent and not just themselves.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:12):**  And not just word of mouth is something that at least if you're in the business and ready  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:16):**  to scale and really to really grow out of, okay, I do extra innings a year and I've 10,  
**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:21):**  20 people and that's okay.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:23):**  But if you're looking to really have an impact, you're going to need platforms like this to  
**[0:17:26-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:26):**  reach people that will never hear about you otherwise.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:30):**  And that's the feedback we're getting is I was initially worried that our people might  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:33):**  be scared of the competition.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:35):**  But what we're seeing is that really skilled advisors and agronomists are recognizing that  
**[0:17:42-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:42):**  you and trainers that if you're trying to change behavior on a farm, one interaction  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:49):**  or a few interactions with a farmer is not enough.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:52):**  So the farmer can afford to attend a three or four day serious training program or have  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:17:57):**  a an agronomy consultation is what like what happens next?  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:18:02):**  How do you keep these people engaged and really what they're wanting and needing is long term  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:18:06):**  ongoing support.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:18:08):**  So there's a lot of interest for people within our platform to say, well, if we did an initial  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:18:14):**  consultation, what about the idea of online coaching groups?  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:18:18):**  And there's kind of other ways to keep people engaged on a long, long term basis.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:18:23):**  And then the extension of that is obviously helping consultants and advisors to extend  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:18:27):**  their network reach international audiences easily, all this kind of thing.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:18:33):**  And you know, obviously drive quality with ratings and reviews.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:18:37):**  And that will be something that you'll be actually be hosting these groups like I have  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:18:41):**  done a consultation with, I don't know, five farms here in Europe, five farmers here in  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:18:46):**  Europe and but I don't want to or I don't have the resources to set up my own digital  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:18:53):**  infrastructure to then do regular webinars with them or check ins, etc.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:18:57):**  That will be potentially something I can do through AgTalent.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:19:00):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:19:02):**  So that's what we're building is that that level of functionality.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:19:05):**  I think our real value will be trying to get a lot of the physical real world content and  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:19:12):**  get it online and get it out to broader audiences.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:19:16):**  So that yeah, that notion of coaching groups, webinars, online training is big on our agenda.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:19:22):**  Yeah, sounds extremely exciting.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:19:25):**  And how has been the response, let's say, from the demand side?  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:19:28):**  I mean, the farmers looking for experts looking for training, looking for people to fill their  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:19:35):**  job options, opportunities, what has been the response there?  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:19:39):**  Yeah, really, really encouraging.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:19:41):**  So we've just in the last week or two, we've made our first kind of successful job postings  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:19:48):**  and placements, where people have had enough high quality applicants that they're really  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:19:53):**  satisfied with the service and are paying, which is incredibly encouraging from the job  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:19:57):**  side considering, you know, the jobs board really only went live properly a month or  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:01):**  two ago, which is exciting.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:03):**  And yeah, like we're just we're building an email list daily, we just launched some training  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:08):**  and job bulletins.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:09):**  So we currently have a fortnightly email that goes out to US audiences, and also Australian  
**[0:20:15-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:15):**  audiences.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:16):**  There's basically a calendar of events of all the upcoming courses and training opportunities  
**[0:20:20-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:20):**  in each state.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:22):**  And we're finding that one like bulletin service has is just getting a lot of traction, like  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:27):**  people are signing up all over the place.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:29):**  So it's, yes, super encouraging.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:31):**  It's just, you know, I think the thing with regenerative ag is it's globally, even even  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:37):**  now, despite all the, you know, the excitement around the movement, it's a very small niche.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:42):**  And I just am cognizant that for us as a business, this is going to be a slow, steady burn.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:48):**  But yeah, it's incredibly exciting so far.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:52):**  Just what you told your investors as well.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:53):**  Yeah, slow and steady burn.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:55):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:20:56):**  I'm kind of using the analogy that it's a bit like investing in farmland, you know,  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:00):**  things in ag just take time, and they're not going to explode overnight.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:04):**  They're just going to be slow, steady, take it one step at a time.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:07):**  And they're fine with that, because it's actually something that comes back in the podcast quite  
**[0:21:10-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:10):**  regularly.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:11):**  Like we have to change the, say the timeline in the heads of investors, or it changes automatically  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:17):**  because the moment people invest in ag and food, everything takes longer than they are  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:22):**  used to in software.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:23):**  But it's something that holds back a lot of people because they somehow have this notion  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:27):**  of quick liquidity, quick exits, etc., which is just absolutely not the case if you want  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:33):**  to rebuild any soil or invest in, let's say, food companies on a regenerative path.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:38):**  Are your investors comfortable with these timelines?  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:41):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:42):**  We're really fortunate at this early stage that the angel investors are supporting us  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:47):**  are completely aligned to the movement and really just say that the potential of this  
**[0:21:54-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:21:54):**  platform is getting in early on the beginnings of what will hopefully be the norm for agriculture  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:01):**  in 10 years time.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:03):**  And it's just kind of getting in very, very early on a new wave, which we're very fortunate  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:11):**  for.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:12):**  I think particularly as soon as you layer in a technology startup, people just automatically  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:18):**  start thinking unicorn mode and how quickly are we going to get 10x returns?  
**[0:22:22-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:22):**  And I just think acknowledging that technology within agriculture is a very unique and interesting  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:30):**  space.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:31):**  So yes, patient capital is key.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:34):**  And what do you see?  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:35):**  I mean, I want to spend some time on one of your investors in a minute, Wide Open Agriculture,  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:39):**  actually one of the groups you work with and for.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:43):**  But I wanted to briefly spend some time on the 10 years you mentioned.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:48):**  What if RegenEgg is the norm in 10 years?  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:53):**  What needs to happen over the years?  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:54):**  What do you see in this case, specifically, maybe in the talent space?  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:22:57):**  What is the because you say we're getting very early, I think we all notice we are early  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:01):**  in this space.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:02):**  But in five years from now, would you have seen massive changes already?  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:07):**  Because if in 10 years it's the norm, we need to get going.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:11):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:12):**  Like it's yeah, it's it's huge.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:16):**  And I think, you know, the interesting thing for me and the thing I hope is within the  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:20):**  talent space.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:21):**  Well, I guess a few things, but obviously, I'd like to see a lot more training a lot.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:27):**  And I think as well, if there can be levers out there to bring the quality along for the  
**[0:23:32-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:32):**  ride as well, so not like, you know, a lot more, but high quality training, you know,  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:38):**  clearer pathways.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:39):**  But I think, you know, I think the main cultural thing that would be amazing to see change  
**[0:23:45-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:45):**  is just like recognizing agriculture as an incredibly challenging, interesting, exciting  
**[0:23:54-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:54):**  career opportunity.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:23:56):**  It needs to attract the best and brightest minds on the planet, like, and just how you  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:24:01):**  know, how we make that cultural shift.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:24:04):**  I think that's that's going to be huge.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:24:06):**  And I think I think it has to happen.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:24:07):**  And I think, you know, the more we start talking and understanding the links between agriculture  
**[0:24:13-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:24:13):**  and climate change, and regenerative agriculture and nutrient density in food, and I guess  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:24:20):**  all the flow on impacts from region ag, I just think it's becoming more and more attractive  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:24:26):**  as a career to younger generations that are really driven by having a positive impact  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:24:32):**  on the world.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:24:33):**  So it's Yeah, all of that stuff is, you know, it's all unfolding and all very interesting.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:24:39):**  And you know, there's a lot to go.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:24:42):**  And what would you without giving investment advice, obviously, but as you have spent time  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:24:47):**  in the investment world, the city impact investment world and also an egg, and imagine there are  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:24:53):**  quite a few investors listening to this podcast, and they're ready, they read the books, they  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:24:58):**  have visited the farms, but they haven't made investments yet, where would you advise them  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:25:02):**  to to look out for or where would you advise them to look at to start looking in terms  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:25:07):**  of this quite vast, but still very small, regenerative ag space?  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:25:12):**  Well, you know, I think I wouldn't be telling astute investors anything new.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:25:18):**  But I'd say investing in teams rather than individuals is huge.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:25:23):**  I think agriculture is really interesting as an industry when you consider a farmer  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:25:29):**  and they have to be, you know, a laborer, an entrepreneur, a technician, a mechanic,  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:25:36):**  they're like, you know, 10 jobs all rolled up into one person.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:25:40):**  And inventor and inventor and a marketer and all of these things.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:25:44):**  And that is, you know, incredibly hard for someone to be very good at all of those things,  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:25:50):**  to have the mindset, this, you know, the skill set to achieve that.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:25:53):**  So I think, from an investment perspective is if you're making, yeah, making investments  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:25:58):**  and looking for the teams behind those investments.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:26:03):**  And I think if you are investing through either an asset manager or an existing agriculture  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:26:09):**  fund would be, yeah, like who are their teams, do they have people on the ground in the regions  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:26:15):**  that they're working?  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:26:16):**  And are they investing in succession planning?  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:26:19):**  I mean, you know, the average age of farmers in Australia is 60 years old.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:26:24):**  So if you're wanting to make a 10 to 20 year investment into regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:26:29):**  then you need to make sure that succession planning is in place.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:26:33):**  And you know, that your asset manager or fund have active career programs, and they're doing  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:26:38):**  something in this space to nurture and grow the next generation of talent, it's gonna  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:26:43):**  be absolutely vital.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:26:44):**  I think you make an excellent point on teams, we as an investor, you would never I mean,  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:26:49):**  most people even say I would not back a startup company where we just one founder, find a  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:26:55):**  co founder first or find a team first before I would even look at it as an investor, somehow  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:26:59):**  as a investor in ag that that until now was never an issue.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:04):**  And obviously, it's extremely risky, because they can never be all like you mentioned before  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:08):**  at the same time and can be amazing at all of them.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:12):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:13):**  And look, you know, really good asset management companies have a really cognizant of that.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:18):**  And they have specialists who help with all the different aspects, you know, and consultants  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:22):**  and advisors where needed.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:24):**  So yeah, it's crucial.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:26):**  And this is a question that I didn't store, but I borrowed from john kent.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:32):**  What do you believe to be true about region ag?  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:34):**  He says about ag in general, modern ag, but I would like to ask you about region ag.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:38):**  So what do you believe to be true about region agriculture that others don't believe to be  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:41):**  true?  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:42):**  Yeah, this is a super tough one.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:45):**  I am a fan of john's podcast.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:51):**  So I hear this question a lot.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:53):**  And it always the answers are always really interesting.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:27:55):**  But I'm going to go out with a kind of potentially controversial one here and say, look, you  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:28:01):**  know, I do think regenerative ag is an incredibly exciting career opportunity for young people.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:28:06):**  But I think we can keep young people in regenerative ag without farmland ownership.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:28:12):**  I know, within Australia, we can, we can, I think we can, I think moving beyond the  
**[0:28:20-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:28:20):**  notion of individual family scale ownership of farmland is not necessarily a bad thing.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:28:28):**  In Australia, it's really culturally ingrained.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:28:31):**  And I'm not you know, I'm not saying family ownership of farmland is a bad thing, either.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:28:34):**  What I'm just saying, contextually in Australia, like Western Australia, for example, the average  
**[0:28:40-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:28:40):**  size of a profitable farm is $6 million worth of capital that you're sitting on, let alone  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:28:48):**  livestock machinery, working capital, that's just the land alone.  
**[0:28:53-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:28:53):**  So carrying that level of capital as a young person, if you don't stand the chance to inherit  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:29:00):**  a farm is near on impossible.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:29:02):**  In no other industry on earth would your kind of starting point require that degree of capital.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:29:08):**  So I think I think there's a lot of work that can be done, particularly in regenerative  
**[0:29:13-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:29:13):**  ag around interesting and new ways of getting young people hooked in as land stewards, as  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:29:22):**  opposed to owners.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:29:23):**  There could be interesting things that can be done within investment funds, for example,  
**[0:29:27-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:29:27):**  where the farm managers and farmers are incentivized with shareholdings in the fund.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:29:34):**  So they're still kind of have skin in the game and still firmly attached to land, but  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:29:39):**  perhaps don't individually own the title as a family.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:29:43):**  I mean, I don't think it's controversial at all.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:29:46):**  I mean, for sure, it's different.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:29:48):**  But it comes back to the discussion we had before on we would never consider in, let's  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:29:54):**  say, startup investing or small company investing.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:29:58):**  There are obviously ways to incentivize your crew and your staff and your team to be part  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:30:04):**  of it and options, et cetera, are very, very normal.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:30:07):**  And somehow in ag, we do everything different.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:30:11):**  And I think the six million or even more is just a barrier that's impossible to enter,  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:30:16):**  because the moment you do that and you raise that kind of capital, you're forced into a  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:30:19):**  short term cash version of ag, which is definitely not regenerative.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:30:24):**  And I think there are so many different ways of steward ownership and other ways to figure  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:30:29):**  out to give young people that want to do that, and let's be very happy about that we have  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:30:33):**  a group of young people that actually want to get into farming and want to get into farming  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:30:37):**  completely differently, that we have to figure out ways to give them access and skin in the  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:30:42):**  game and tie them longer to the land, but maybe growing into it or the ownership is  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:30:47):**  formally somewhere else.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:30:49):**  But it's I think it's a huge investment opportunity, because there's only so much land you can  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:30:52):**  buy as an investor, and then lease out.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:30:54):**  And I think we need all this, these different hybrid models to give access to two millions  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:00):**  and millions of young farmers on this.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:01):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:03):**  And I think the particular opportunity with region ag as opposed to normal agriculture  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:08):**  is that I think people who are like people are going to be attracted to this space as  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:13):**  young farmers, purely for the impact potential alone, and for the sense of contributing to  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:18):**  positive change in the world.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:20):**  So I think like that carrot alone is enough to get people in that you you know, ownership  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:26):**  of land is not a requirement.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:28):**  Now, I think a return on their time, I think we do need to have a discussion on sustainability,  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:36):**  financial sustainability of farms and the fact that I really have issues finding profitable  
**[0:31:41-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:41):**  farms like commercially, chemically industrial driven farms that are profitable without any  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:47):**  subsidies or without, I mean, EU, I think it's nearly impossible, I will probably get  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:51):**  emails of this but to find and the region ag farmers I meet, they are very different,  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:57):**  but they also have very different margins.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:31:59):**  And actually, in some cases, are much more profitable, if you look at their timing, and  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:03):**  if you look at what they sell.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:04):**  So it's also, I speak to investors that see finally we see a way of making money in and  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:09):**  investing in ag because of region ag just approaches it completely different.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:13):**  So I think there's a, there's going to be also a very interesting carrot there, not  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:17):**  that you're going to be a multibillionaire overnight, you can have your exits.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:20):**  But there's good money to be made like honest good money in region ag.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:25):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:26):**  And especially, you know, if we get into, you know, the eventual reality of farmers  
**[0:32:31-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:31):**  being rewarded for ecosystem services, and I think, you know, tying in those positive  
**[0:32:37-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:37):**  impacts where, you know, young farmers who are managing or supporting farmers as you  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:43):**  know, assistant managers or whatever are all tied into that long term ecological gain on  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:48):**  the land.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:49):**  I think if we can get some of those levers right and really incentivize people for being  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:54):**  stewards of land, and increasing the health of land, I think that's, you know, that's  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:32:58):**  an incredibly exciting space moving forward.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:01):**  And it's one that supposedly gets better.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:04):**  It's like, it's not an asset.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:06):**  I mean, it's not it's not in terms of these ecosystem payment services, we'll figure part  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:12):**  of them out over the next years.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:14):**  Hopefully the nutrient density comes online as well, in a sense that we can have an honest  
**[0:33:18-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:18):**  discussion about food as medicine.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:20):**  And that should mean that the farmers that are really good at that will be rewarded,  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:24):**  hopefully, I mean, we have to build systems for that for producing more nutrients.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:28):**  So even if you can already, let's say out compete or compete at the current scale where  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:33):**  food is still just food and not medicine, and where there are hardly any payments for  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:38):**  ecosystem services, imagine in 10 years from now, I mean, you will be the one I mean, sitting  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:43):**  on an asset or working with an asset that has actually became better because you hopefully  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:47):**  have rebuilt the soil, and maybe even getting a number of other rewards that others don't.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:52):**  So I think it's in terms of long term perspective, whoever gets in now, the same with the Ag  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:33:57):**  Talent Platform, whoever gets in now and has the breath to keep going, probably gets get  
**[0:34:02-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:02):**  some very interesting rewards in the future.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:05):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:07):**  You know, it's like, I guess we've we've seen decades of agriculture effectively mining  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:12):**  nutrient value from soil and depleting the you know, the natural value of the land.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:18):**  And to have that turned around, and then farmers potentially monetarily rewarded for what makes  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:23):**  sense anyway, it's Yeah, if we can get to that place, you know, I've got no doubt about  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:28):**  the future of ag and you know, potentially life on the planet if we can get to that point.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:34):**  And I mean, it's a bit it's a bit of a switch.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:36):**  But can you spend a few words?  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:37):**  Well, at some point, I will interview definitely a wide open agriculture and maybe you and  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:42):**  spend a full episode on what you are doing in Australia.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:46):**  But can you spend a few words on it?  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:48):**  As we mentioned at the beginning, and also a few minutes ago, what is wide open agriculture?  
**[0:34:53-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:53):**  Sure.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:54):**  So wide open agriculture is a regenerative food and farming company based in Western  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:34:59):**  Australia.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:00):**  And really, we're working across the side of the business that I'm involved with is  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:03):**  wide open land, which is a farmland asset manager.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:07):**  So obviously, tying in a lot of the work I'm focused on around talent, talent development  
**[0:35:12-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:12):**  and managing teams is we basically seek out and pull together investment opportunities  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:18):**  in West Australian ag.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:20):**  And then we manage them ongoing on behalf of investors.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:24):**  And then so wide open agriculture has a food brand called dirty clean food, which is just  
**[0:35:31-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:31):**  launching.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:32):**  Very nice name.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:33):**  Yeah, it's a bit provocative.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:35):**  And it's designed just to make people kind of delve deeper and understand where their  
**[0:35:39-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:39):**  foods come from and the soil story is absolutely central to the brand.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:46):**  And look, so yeah, basically, we're bringing product online now.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:50):**  We're currently selling regenerative grass fed beef and lamb through food service to  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:35:55):**  some of the best restaurants in Perth and looking to expand into export.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:00):**  And we have retail opportunities happening now as well.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:02):**  So branded product on retail shelves and supermarkets.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:06):**  So really, as a company, it's working right across the value chain from my side of the  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:11):**  business, which farmland right through to, you know, being able to generate a premium  
**[0:36:16-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:16):**  for regenerative product.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:18):**  And they are one of the seed funders in act on.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:21):**  Yeah, that's correct.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:22):**  So basically, they made a seed investment in a talent along alongside with me joining  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:27):**  the company and starting to work there.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:29):**  It's basically Ag talent now sits within my portfolio of responsibility.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:33):**  So it's, yeah, it's, you know, it's pretty amazing.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:35):**  I get to work on new new farmland deals regularly.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:40):**  And then also, you know, along the way, look at this whole talent development platform.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:45):**  And I guess as a company, they really saw that talent was a key kind of barrier and  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:51):**  limitation to growing the farmland portfolio.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:54):**  So if we don't, you know, any asset manager out there who looks after farmland, if they  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:36:59):**  don't have a strategy for talent, and talent procurement, then, you know, they're going  
**[0:37:04-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:37:04):**  to be in trouble long term.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:37:05):**  So I think that, you know, they really recognize the value there.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:37:08):**  And to bring it all under one roof is, yeah, pretty amazing.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:37:12):**  Extremely exciting.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:37:13):**  I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:37:15):**  And we can spend a lot of time on talent, a lot of time on wide open ag and a lot of  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:37:20):**  time on nutrient density and ecosystem payments.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:37:25):**  But it will be for another time.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:37:26):**  So I want to be conscious of your time and wrapping up.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:37:29):**  I want to thank you so much, Lucky for for this morning, this evening, actually for you.

**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:40:10):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:40:17-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:40:17):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:40:19):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:40:24):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:40:29):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:40:34-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:40:34):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:40:35):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:40:40-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:40:40):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:40:44):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:40:49):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:40:50):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:40:52):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:40:55):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:40:58):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/20/lachy-ritchie/#t=0:41:00):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

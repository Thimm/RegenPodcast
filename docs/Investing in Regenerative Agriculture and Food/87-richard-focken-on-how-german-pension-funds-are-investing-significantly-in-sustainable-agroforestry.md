**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:00:14):**  How can we scale agroforestry to have the impact we need in terms of climate, biodiversity,  
**[0:00:19-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:00:19):**  social impact and food and fibers?  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:00:21):**  For this we need the biggest investors in the world to invest in it.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:00:24):**  So how can we make agroforestry investable and bankable?  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:00:27):**  And how can we follow the example of the renewable energy industry, which grew from very few  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:00:31):**  small projects here and there 20 years ago to a massive investable and bankable industry?  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:00:37):**  This interview we explore the four-year due diligence which led to a German pension fund  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:00:41):**  investing 200 million into agroforestry.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:00:46):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:00:51):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:00:55):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:01:00):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:01:06):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:01:08):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:01:12):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:01:15):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:01:20):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:01:24):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:48-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:01:48):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:01:50):**  Welcome to another interview today with Richard Falken, co-founder and current CEO of One  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:01:54):**  Two Three, the pioneers in making sustainable forestry and agriculture projects investable  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:01:59):**  at a large scale.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:00):**  We interviewed Olive Hrenke, chief project officer in March this year, but I wanted to  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:05):**  dig deeper in how One Two Three managed to get a German pension fund to invest 200 million  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:10):**  euros in agroforestry.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:12):**  Welcome Richard.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:13):**  Thank you very much for the introduction, Koen.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:15):**  I'm delighted to participate in this series.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:17):**  Don't be scared.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:18):**  You mentioned this is your first podcast and I'm sure you're going to like it.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:22):**  But I want to start with a personal question, which I think is easy to answer, but might  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:25):**  be quite extensive.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:27):**  What brings you to soil?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:28):**  Why are you doing what you're doing?  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:29):**  Yes, I mean, it's a fundamental question.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:32):**  It's a long story, but I'll try to make it short.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:34):**  First half of my life, I was focused on more commercial businesses.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:38):**  This second half of my life, and given my age, that maybe explains why I haven't been  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:44):**  involved too much with podcasts yet.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:47):**  I focused on climate change mitigation for like the last 15 years or so.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:52):**  And to me, that is the one big thing that humanity has not managed to come to grips  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:57):**  with.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:02:58):**  And it doesn't, to me, it doesn't look like we immediately will.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:03:02):**  That's my behind motivation that helped me start looking much more seriously at forestry  
**[0:03:07-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:03:07):**  and agroforestry in the context of large scale investments and making it accessible to investors.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:03:16):**  Now where does soil come into play here?  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:03:18):**  Soil of course, is the key to everything.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:03:22):**  All our nutrition is based on it.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:03:24):**  And from a climate change mitigation perspective, soil is super interesting because our soil  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:03:29):**  holds about three times as much carbon as the whole atmosphere and about five times  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:03:35):**  as much carbon as in the world combined.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:03:38):**  So soil is a prime carbon sink, and especially the organic soil components.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:03:44):**  I don't want to necessarily educate everybody here about soil, but a good soil is composed  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:03:50):**  mostly of what we call humus.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:03:52):**  So it's mostly fungi, microbes that transform plant matter into soil, other organic matter.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:03:59):**  And at the end of the day for us, all projects are really soil management and soil health  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:04):**  projects.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:05):**  So good soils give you amazing growth.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:08):**  They take away the disease pressure they make for healthy plants, healthy trees.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:13):**  And we see ourselves as guardians of the soil for future generations.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:18):**  So for us, soil is the key to land-based carbon sequestration.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:22):**  And do you still remember when you, I mean, this is a very profound insight that I think  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:27):**  many people in the podcast, they agree and definitely write me if you don't, like they  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:31):**  share that and we share that.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:34):**  Do you remember when that came about?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:36):**  Was there one moment, was that a number of pieces where you went from basically climate  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:41):**  change, carbon in trees or trees have a lot of carbon to soil as well?  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:46):**  Like that didn't happen overnight, I think.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:48):**  Do you remember where and how that triggered that insight?  
**[0:04:51-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:52):**  The frustration actually, for me, the moment came when the Kyoto Protocol collapsed, when  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:04:57):**  Canada exited the Kyoto Protocol and the carbon price went from what was above 20 euros per  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:05:04):**  ton to down to something like two euros or something per ton.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:05:09):**  So the right to pollute, basically pollution was free once more.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:05:12):**  You didn't have to owe up to the carbon pollution in the atmosphere.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:05:16):**  And it made a lot of the projects I worked on collapsed.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:05:20):**  I was engaged already in the Kyoto Protocol in creating carbon emission reduction projects,  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:05:26):**  very real projects all over the world.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:05:29):**  And I said, no, you know, the carbon credits is not the answer here.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:05:33):**  I need to do something more tangible.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:05:35):**  And to me, the most tangible project then was forestry.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:05:39):**  And what later with a very deep interest in agroforestry, I also come from a forestry  
**[0:05:45-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:05:45):**  background.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:05:46):**  My family has a long standing tradition of foresters and are very close to nature.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:05:50):**  So we've been a little bit pre-exposed from the first time we saw the light of day when  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:05:57):**  we were born and brought up in a house in the middle of the forest without electricity  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:01):**  or running water to today.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:03):**  So that basically that circle closed for me at that point in time.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:06):**  I said, no, this is the point in time when I need to do something more concrete and I  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:09):**  need to engage directly with forestry and agroforestry systems.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:15):**  That was the click moment for me, if you want.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:17):**  And just for the listeners who haven't listened, which I will definitely link below to the  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:21):**  interview with Oliver, what is in a few sentences, what is 123, what are you leading?  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:27):**  What is the 123 project or company you're leading at the moment?  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:30):**  Our theory of change, if you want, is two-sided.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:33):**  We have two focal points.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:36):**  One is to transform finance by creating sustainable nature or soil based investments as a real  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:42):**  asset class for professional and large scale investors who are also looking for climate  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:48):**  impact and return at the same time.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:51):**  And large scale, what are we talking about?  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:53):**  These are hundreds of millions at a time, right?  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:55):**  Well, these are pension funds and insurance companies primarily.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:06:59):**  These are the biggest investors in the world.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:07:01):**  And for those today, this asset class is not really accessible given their regulatory frameworks,  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:07:10):**  given their need to be very conservative and their obligation to not lose money for their  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:07:15):**  pensioners or for the insured population.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:07:19):**  And we wanted to change that.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:07:21):**  We basically want to make this accessible with a view to making agroforestry systems  
**[0:07:27-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:07:27):**  as investable as solar energy or wind energy is today to achieve that same kind of bankability.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:07:35):**  That is our long term vision for the financial side.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:07:38):**  And you see that as absolutely essential to get to the scale of impact we need.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:07:44):**  We're not going to get there with private individuals investing, with high net worth  
**[0:07:49-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:07:49):**  individuals.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:07:50):**  We need to, like in your theory of change, we need the largest pots of money basically  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:07:55):**  we can get our hands on to invest seriously in the space like they're investing in renewable  
**[0:07:59-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:07:59):**  energy now.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:00):**  Yes.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:01):**  I mean, maybe before I answer that one, I would like to expose the second part of our  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:05):**  theory of change because as I said, it's kind of two sided.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:09):**  And the second part is the actual subject matter.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:13):**  In order to make this accessible, we felt that there is a lack of skilled operator who  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:18):**  can de-risk the business for these institutional investors.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:23):**  So we decided to create an operational company that can deliver and walk the talk on sustainability  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:30):**  issues, but also on all operational issues.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:33):**  And that is the second piece.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:35):**  It's basically improving the way that forestry and sustainable agriculture is being done  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:40):**  today and to marry that into the financial world in such a way that all stakeholders  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:47):**  benefit.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:48):**  This is kind of the second piece.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:50):**  And that risk piece is key, obviously, to the institutional world.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:08:55):**  And you're saying they've seen maybe this space as too small and thus or maybe end too  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:02):**  risky to place their large investments that are placing otherware in real estate and renewable  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:08):**  energy, et cetera.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:09):**  So there's hardly so far, I think you've been the only one able to raise from a pension  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:14):**  fund these amount of serious capital for an agroforestry investment.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:19):**  Is that correct?  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:20):**  Are there other?  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:21):**  I think there are some others, but they are more on the North American or Canadian side.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:25):**  And their motivation is still a little bit more classical, let's say more purely profit  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:30):**  driven.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:31):**  But traditionally, there have been timber investments and also agricultural investments,  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:37):**  but not necessarily with the sustainability and impact objectives that we have today.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:43):**  And the key challenge here is to, as I said, is this marriage between the impact objectives  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:47):**  on the one side and to still achieve sufficient profitability that allow pension funds to  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:52):**  pay their pensions.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:53):**  And this is completely achievable, actually.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:55):**  It's a myth that this doesn't work.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:09:57):**  It is a question of good management and of good operational discipline and of a certain  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:02):**  long term view also.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:05):**  But those are some of the problems.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:06):**  And I guess we may come to that in a little bit more detail.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:08):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:09):**  I would love to unpack.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:11):**  So because you already answered actually a question I always ask at the end, like, what  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:14):**  do you believe to be true about region egg that others don't?  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:17):**  Definitely inspired by John Kempf.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:19):**  And I think the myth here, you might have another answer, we can get back to that later.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:22):**  But the myth that it is possible with good management and a long term view to get good  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:27):**  returns and as not just financial, but actually also the impact.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:30):**  I think that's something fundamental, because otherwise we cannot expect pension funds and  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:35):**  insurance companies to even get into this space or even look at it, if we cannot get  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:40):**  the returns that they not because they want to, but they need to literally in their system.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:45):**  It's built into that.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:46):**  Yes.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:47):**  And pension funds don't even look at agroforestry.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:51):**  They don't know that it exists, basically.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:53):**  But it's just not an asset class yet.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:55):**  When they do the asset allocation, they just nobody thinking of agroforestry, I can assure  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:10:59):**  you, just start there.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:01):**  So our job to get it onto the radar screen and to create successful cases.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:06):**  And here, with today's sustainability drivers, it's really happening now, actually.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:12):**  I've looked at this for many years.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:14):**  And people have politely nodded their heads, but they've never engaged.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:20):**  But today people engage, actually, they're really interested.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:22):**  They really want to go deeper and to have more impact and get a bigger bang for the  
**[0:11:26-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:26):**  buck if possible.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:27):**  Yeah, let's explore that.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:29):**  Because you I mean, we've known each other for a number of years.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:32):**  And I've seen from the outside, let's say the process, because I think the first is  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:36):**  always the most difficult one.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:38):**  In this case, a German pension fund that agreed to invest 200 million into 123 or into agroforestry  
**[0:11:43-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:43):**  through 123.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:44):**  How did that come about?  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:45):**  I mean, this is a very open question.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:47):**  We're going to unpack that.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:48):**  But what did the first contact look like?  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:50):**  Did you contact them?  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:51):**  Did they contacted you?  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:53):**  What was that process of getting a behemoth basically to actually look at it as an asset  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:11:57):**  class and look at it as a serious investment and not just something philanthropy might  
**[0:12:02-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:02):**  put 500,000 to compensate something?  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:04):**  No, they actually made an investment.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:06):**  So how did that start?  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:07):**  It was initiated from our side, basically, or from my side to be concrete, by presenting  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:13):**  a case to the consultant that is helping our pension funds to manage their money.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:20):**  And the first time around, they looked at me and said, Yeah, sure, come back when you  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:27):**  have definitely a double digit return.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:29):**  And anyway, what is this?  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:32):**  Then a year went by, and I tried again, and talking to different people.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:37):**  And by that time, the interest in sustainability had increased to such a stage that was taken  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:42):**  seriously.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:43):**  And I was heard basically, the proposal could be made.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:47):**  And then we're building political support for this over the course of a year, roughly.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:52):**  Political meaning in the pension fund or political in the country?  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:55):**  But then several pension funds.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:58):**  How did you do that?  
**[0:12:59-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:12:59):**  Did you bring them to the field to the forest?  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:02):**  How do you get support in these boards?  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:04):**  We already had a precursor organization.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:07):**  And we basically they asked independent experts and consultants to visit what we have been  
**[0:13:13-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:13):**  doing before, to visit farms and forests and to do due diligence on site in Latin Central  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:21):**  America on the quality of the operations and all kinds of aspects that you can imagine  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:26):**  for about six months.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:27):**  So you have, there was a track record, there were farms and forests to visit of the previous  
**[0:13:32-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:32):**  work basically you've done.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:33):**  So it wasn't completely, these are some renderings.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:36):**  This is what we're maybe going to do.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:38):**  No, this is what we're going to do, but larger and look, there are the examples.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:42):**  Yes, there was some previous work on a smaller scale.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:46):**  And we were basically proposing to scale that up.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:49):**  And there was a certain leap of faith there, I guess, to trust us to manage that scaling  
**[0:13:54-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:54):**  up.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:13:55):**  So then personally I've been involved in other companies before and my passion is definitely  
**[0:14:01-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:01):**  scale.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:02):**  It really is fun to scale things up.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:04):**  I find, I know it's not, I don't have to have all the original ideas myself and I definitely  
**[0:14:10-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:10):**  don't, but I really like to apply energy to making good things work better and bigger  
**[0:14:17-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:17):**  and get more impact, more traction.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:20):**  And this is what they saw.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:22):**  They saw this energy and trusted us to create this opportunity.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:26):**  Every investment that we do, I mean, yes, there's a certain willingness to invest, but  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:31):**  then every single project that is presented can also be rejected.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:35):**  It's piece by piece.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:36):**  It's piece by piece.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:37):**  So it grows over time.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:39):**  And today we have commitments of about 270 million and we've invested most of that, but  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:44):**  it's 12 different projects with a few more coming this year in seven different countries.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:50):**  And every single one of them can be of course rejected.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:53):**  Every single one of them has to fulfill all of the criteria.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:14:56):**  There's a very extensive professional asset management, investment management process  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:00):**  going on, very intensive due diligence processes, et cetera, that make sure that everything  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:06):**  we propose is double tested and there's independent experts for just about every aspect of the  
**[0:15:12-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:12):**  business being heard.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:14):**  And only if they approve, only if they concur with us will a project go ahead.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:19):**  And how long did it take from, I mean, you mentioned the year went by from like the first  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:23):**  connection and you connected with some other people and then six months.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:26):**  I mean, I remember from your stories and being on the outside and seeing very little, obviously,  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:32):**  that it was a long process.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:34):**  How many hoops did you have to jump through basically, logically, obviously, because they're  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:38):**  investing not their own money, but I can imagine from your side, did you think many times you  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:42):**  were there and then actually there was another phase in due diligence that emerged out of  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:46):**  nowhere?  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:47):**  The real total length of the process from the first contact to somebody from these pension  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:53):**  funds to the actual start of the project, we were looking, the first contact was in  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:15:59):**  2013.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:01):**  And then a long time, nothing happened.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:02):**  That's when the relationship started to build.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:04):**  And then we actually executed and signed contracts on March 2017.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:09):**  Wow.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:10):**  Now, just to give people an understanding of when you first do something, because for  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:15):**  everybody it was new and the length and time it takes for institutional investors to put  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:20):**  money to work, that people have an idea of, okay, it's three to four years, there's nothing  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:25):**  in this space basically.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:26):**  But now with the second one, I'm imagining, I hope that it goes faster or not, you're  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:32):**  laughing.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:33):**  Yes.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:34):**  And I really must say that we have been very blessed with fantastic support from our investors.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:39):**  They've really helped us grow and they've babysat our growth, helping us to develop into a professional  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:45):**  asset management so that we could also focus very much on the operational side.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:51):**  It has really been like a partnership of developing this together that has worked very well for  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:56):**  hopefully both sides so far.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:16:58):**  And in terms of returns, obviously it's early on, but what have you seen in the assets that  
**[0:17:04-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:17:04):**  you've bought, are they performing as the models or as the predictions have predicted?  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:17:12):**  Is the investor going to be happy or is the investor happy?  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:17:14):**  Or what have you seen over the last years in terms of what you planned and what's actually  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:17:19):**  happening?  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:17:20):**  Yeah, even though we are in the long-term business, you can still measure reasonably  
**[0:17:25-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:17:25):**  precisely the ongoing so-called net asset value, which shows you the implicit increase  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:17:32):**  in value in a given project.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:17:34):**  And that is established by independent experts as well on the biological forestry side, as  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:17:39):**  well as on the financial side.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:17:42):**  And so being part of a professional investment asset management process, we have a quarterly  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:17:48):**  assessment basically, and once a year there's physical controls of everything.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:17:53):**  So we know that we are developing reasonably well.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:17:57):**  Out of a portfolio of projects, I would say there are a couple of projects that are performing  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:01):**  clearly below expectations.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:03):**  There are a couple of projects that are performing above expectations and there are some projects  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:09):**  that are performing in line with expectations.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:11):**  So you kind of have a typical statistical normal average.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:17):**  But the good news is that we have invested more than 150 million euros so far into these  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:23):**  projects and we can show already that most of that is working quite well.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:28):**  And in terms of returns, you mentioned something, unless there's a double-digit return, these  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:33):**  investors are not even coming to the table.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:36):**  And you also said it's perfectly possible to have a good return.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:40):**  You didn't say double digit.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:41):**  Is there a tension you see in your projects between the return they want, the investor,  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:46):**  they being the investor, and the focus on sustainable and let's say towards regenerative,  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:51):**  which I think you mentioned very nicely, I will link it below as well, in your impact  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:55):**  report?  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:18:56):**  Is there a tension you see between the return that some of these, and maybe also the speed,  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:19:00):**  like the time that some of these investors need or want or have in their system, and  
**[0:19:04-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:19:04):**  the focus on sustainability and regeneration?  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:19:07):**  There's several answers to this.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:19:08):**  My first answer at a high level is there's no real tension between return expectation  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:19:16):**  and sustainability as such, if you have enough time.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:19:20):**  That if is very important.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:19:23):**  If we take a step back, then you look at the classical way to invest in agriculture, or  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:19:29):**  that is invested locally in Latin America or in Africa, et cetera, is fairly short term  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:19:35):**  with the locals investing, they have like a 20% return expectation or more, or they  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:19:41):**  wouldn't even consider an investment.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:19:44):**  And pension funds basically need to deliver today to back to their investors probably  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:19:50):**  about would be happy to deliver 4% or 4.5%.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:19:55):**  So in order to get there and to compensate for their own cost structures, et cetera,  
**[0:20:00-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:20:00):**  the very minimum you have to deliver across everything is somewhere between 6% and 8%.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:20:07):**  Having said that, there are individual project types that deliver more.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:20:12):**  Greenfield projects where you have a higher risk have to deliver above that because the  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:20:18):**  risk is higher and brownfield projects where you basically take over existing already planted  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:20:24):**  ecosystems and that already have some returns would fall into that category.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:20:30):**  And then we have long term forestry, where we really have like evergreen type of investment,  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:20:36):**  where you don't have to exit and there if you can deliver like 6% or so over the long  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:20:41):**  term, then you can stay in and never have to exit because the investor is happy with  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:20:47):**  that.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:20:48):**  And these returns for these different type of projects and different type of risk are  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:20:52):**  possible.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:20:53):**  That's what you're saying.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:20:54):**  Yes, those are the ones we are seeing and as we get more experienced, I think we also  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:01):**  getting better at making correct and realistic assumptions about some of these parameters.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:08):**  Of course.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:09):**  Getting more and more experienced.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:11):**  So there is a tendency for increasing profitability over time in our projects.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:16):**  We look at the first projects that will be less profitable than the projects we are doing  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:21):**  now.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:22):**  That is also...  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:23):**  Yeah, you're learning obviously.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:25):**  We are on a pretty good learning curve.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:28):**  Once you've done that three, four years with one and obviously a lot of education on your  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:33):**  side and a lot of education on the side of the pension fund.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:36):**  I don't know if you're currently talking to other large scale investors, but do you see,  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:41):**  I mean, the world has changed as well, obviously over the last years, but is the second one  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:45):**  or would the second one, if you're not talking yet, going faster, you think?  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:49):**  Or is it anyway a very long process if you want institutional capital to come on board?  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:55):**  Because we're not...  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:21:56):**  It's not that they can compare you to 10 other renewable energy funds or renewable energy  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:00):**  asset managers.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:01):**  Do you see there a potential speed up or you have to go through a three, four year process  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:06):**  again?  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:07):**  No, there will definitely be a speed up and there's several factors at work actually,  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:11):**  but due to a certain established base, we already have some other investors now that  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:17):**  are investing through our fund, Brownfield Fund, the Kakao I work for, Sufan basically  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:23):**  is called the SAF.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:24):**  I'm sure Oliver talked about that in his podcast, and because he's managing it.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:29):**  So we have some investors in there and we are now also, we're opening up the business  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:34):**  development to also work with large off-takers who are interested in sustainable supply chain.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:40):**  So on the strength of our farming and operational capacity, they are interested in securing  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:47):**  sustainable supply, for example, for Kakao, sustainable Kakao production, which is one  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:53):**  of our specialties.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:55):**  And they're willing to invest potentially in the forestry as well to get access to this  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:22:59):**  level of quality and quantity.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:23:01):**  Yes, because there is a scarcity of supply of truly sustainable production in that space.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:23:07):**  And we've basically decided at the beginning of our company to jump in there and to create  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:23:13):**  that a position in sustainable Kakao production, but also in other products like coconut, for  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:23:19):**  example, sustainable bananas, dates and other fruits.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:23:23):**  But right now the emphasis find a way still sustainable Kakao production.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:23:28):**  And that's also opening up quite a big field that is at least as big as institutional investors  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:23:34):**  and possibly bigger actually.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:23:35):**  Wow, yeah, and more aligned because you need the off-takers.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:23:39):**  Like you need someone, someone needs to buy obviously the forest produced, agroforestry  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:23:44):**  products coming off your farms and your projects.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:23:48):**  Yes.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:23:49):**  It's part of this de-risking that I mentioned earlier.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:23:51):**  Our job is to bring together key players in this value chain and the better the partners,  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:23:57):**  the less risk is inherently left for everybody.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:00):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:02):**  Our partners on the supply side, on the demand side are very interested in having pension  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:08):**  fund money co-investing into these projects because the cost of capital is lower simply.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:14):**  And it works both ways.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:15):**  It works for the off-takers because they have to only invest a small piece or a certain  
**[0:24:20-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:20):**  part of that.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:22):**  And because they really want to have the sustainable produce and it works for the pension fund  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:27):**  because it's really secure if you have a 10-year or 15-year off-take agreement at an attractive  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:33):**  rate, then that really secures the whole deal.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:35):**  It's really similar to renewable energy where we were maybe 15 or maybe 20, 15 years ago.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:42):**  Like the off-take, which obviously were the power purchase agreements and slowly the institutional  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:47):**  money coming in, et cetera, et cetera, and the asset managers in the middle trying to  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:51):**  make it work.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:53):**  And we don't see a lot of specialization yet.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:24:55):**  So we have to reach out to all directions and try to create this sustainable middle  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:02):**  element that ties everything together.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:05):**  And I mean, I ask the question often, but in this case it fits very well.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:09):**  How far off are we or what would happen if you would have a billion dollars to invest,  
**[0:25:14-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:14):**  let's say tomorrow morning?  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:15):**  I mean, you have two more doubles going from 250 or 270, you're almost there with two more  
**[0:25:20-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:20):**  exponential growth steps, but what would you focus on if you had a billion dollars to invest?  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:27):**  And just to be clear with the conditions you would like, it's an investment portfolio,  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:31):**  but the timing you can choose and also the return, what would you focus your energy and  
**[0:25:35-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:35):**  in this case your resources on?  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:38):**  You know, we're actually not that far away, I think, from that point in time.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:41):**  This doesn't happen very often in this podcast.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:43):**  I don't know, I asked this question and we're not that far away from that point.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:46):**  That's very good.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:48):**  I think we're going to see a substantial increase of our portfolio over the next year or two  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:52):**  with very promising deals that I unfortunately cannot talk about.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:25:57):**  So to me, first of all, one billion in the context of climate change mitigation is a  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:03):**  small number.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:04):**  It's nice, and I'll answer your question in a second, but I would like to put this number  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:08):**  into perspective for any of your listeners who made it this far.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:14):**  You know, what can you achieve with one billion actually in terms of problems with frustration?  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:17):**  If you invested in an agroforestry system or in a forestry system, you probably get  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:21):**  about 20 million tons of CO2 sequestered.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:24):**  Is that per year, per block of time?  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:27):**  Unfortunately not.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:29):**  That's 20 million over 20 years.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:31):**  Okay.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:32):**  So it's about a million tons per year, roughly.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:36):**  And if we are generous and if we had a methodology that would actually look at soil and what  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:40):**  we actually sequester in the soil, the real carbon sequestration is much higher actually,  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:44):**  because we don't take soil sequestration into account here.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:47):**  So this is pure biomass trees?  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:50):**  It is pure biomass and purely what is actually the smallest common denominator that can be  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:54):**  measured by gold standard or BCS.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:26:57):**  Let's say you can get up to 30 million tons of CO2 with your one billion euros.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:27:03):**  So I would ask you if we want to compensate the 40 billion tons of carbon that we're putting  
**[0:27:10-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:27:10):**  into the air every year as humanity, how much billion do we need to take these out of the  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:27:17):**  air to compensate 40 billion tons of CO2 that we're putting out every year?  
**[0:27:23-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:27:23):**  What would that be in billions?  
**[0:27:26-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:27:26):**  And so it's just to show you that we'll take about 1,330 billion euros in order to do that,  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:27:34):**  just to put that number into perspective.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:27:36):**  So you would leverage it.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:27:37):**  So how would you use that billion to get the thousand times, more than thousand times actually  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:27:41):**  you need?  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:27:42):**  Yeah, I mean, first of all, if I had a billion euros to invest tomorrow, I would focus on  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:27:48):**  very few crops, two or three crops and try to become a world knowledge leader and make  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:27:54):**  these crops super sustainable in the way they're being grown, trying to maximize the climate  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:00):**  impact of that.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:01):**  This is more or less our strategy on the operational side to pick a few crops that we really, really  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:07):**  want to understand deeply in the context of an overall biodiverse and possibly regenerative  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:13):**  system that then will drag along a lot of other crops in such a system at some point  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:18):**  later.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:19):**  But first of all, we really need to understand how to work with a few strategic crops that  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:24):**  are important to the farming community and to the food and forest community.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:29):**  Would you choose the biggest commodity crops there or would you choose the ones with the  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:33):**  biggest potential for regeneration?  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:35):**  How would you select if you only could select three?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:38):**  We would always go tree based as we want to promote climate change mitigation.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:43):**  Where we would basically get the biggest bang for the buck in climate change terms would  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:47):**  be something that really lends itself well to agroforestry systems.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:52):**  With a market, with, yeah, obviously.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:28:54):**  Yeah, with a real market where if you look at the palm oil catastrophe, which palm oil  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:01):**  is such of course is not a bad thing.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:03):**  It's just the way it has been applied and forests have been destroyed to create huge  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:07):**  monocultures.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:08):**  But there are a number of crops out there.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:12):**  Coconut would be one of them possibly that are still much underappreciated, I think today,  
**[0:29:17-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:17):**  that are used that have amazing usages that we would like to engage in much more than  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:24):**  today.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:25):**  And that actually it's a nice bridge to a question.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:27):**  I mean, it could be the same answer, but I'm not going to ask it anyway.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:30):**  I've been experimenting a bit with asking this question on using the ITN framework.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:35):**  So the I for importance, the T for attractability and the N for neglect thickness coming from  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:41):**  effective altruism and a few other organizations.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:43):**  And if you want to know more, I will link some links below.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:46):**  But basically looking at what you're trying to do in this case, focusing on a few crops  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:50):**  or even in general, focusing on agroforestry and how to get institutional capital in there,  
**[0:29:55-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:55):**  looking at the importance, which is what is the scale of the problem?  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:29:57):**  Like if all the problems in this area will be solved, like how much better would we,  
**[0:30:02-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:02):**  the world be?  
**[0:30:03-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:03):**  Tractability, like how solvable is the problem actually?  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:06):**  And neglect thickness, how many other people are working on it with the thought that if  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:10):**  less people are working on it, your edit work will make a bigger difference.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:14):**  If you have to look at importance, tractability and neglect thickness in, I mean, you chose  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:19):**  agroforestry, I think for these reasons, but within agroforestry, not necessarily from  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:23):**  the $1 billion investment fund, but just instead, if you had all the time in the world, what  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:27):**  would you focus on and what would you spend your days on?  
**[0:30:30-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:30):**  Or are you doing that already?  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:32):**  Ah, yeah, that's a good one.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:34):**  And a big, it's a big one.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:36):**  Yeah, I'd like to maybe take a step back again, looking at this, because I want to resist  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:42):**  the temptation to make every problem look like a nail when I only have a hand.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:48):**  So for us, first of all, it's very important to create holistic solutions.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:53):**  Everything we do, whether it's agroforestry, whether it is regenerative agriculture, it  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:30:58):**  has to be in the context of an overall system that makes sense, otherwise not going to work.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:31:03):**  So that's why I would like to take a quick step back and look at what are the fundamental  
**[0:31:08-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:31:08):**  problems facing us.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:31:09):**  So the fundamental problem that I'm trying to solve or helping contributing to solve  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:31:14):**  at the beginning when we started out, it was climate change mitigation.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:31:18):**  And it got more complex as we went deeper.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:31:21):**  I've heard that before from other people.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:31:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:31:24):**  So we today we know with like 100% certainty that the 35 to 40 billion tons of CO2 that  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:31:30):**  we put into the atmosphere every year, that will lead us to tipping points of no return.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:31:36):**  So there is a certain urgency to act now from that point of view.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:31:41):**  And climate scientists that are not obliged to be politically correct, that can speak  
**[0:31:46-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:31:46):**  out freely in scientific journals, they are convinced that three to four degrees is probably  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:31:53):**  fairly realistic and not necessarily a pessimistic scenario actually for what's going to happen  
**[0:31:59-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:31:59):**  in reality.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:01):**  And all political efforts so far have not really led to a net reduction in global carbon  
**[0:32:06-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:06):**  output.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:07):**  No matter what all our politicians have said, we're still in a rising curve of carbon output  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:12):**  today, no matter what everybody is claiming.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:16):**  So if I look at the importance of this triple question, what is the fastest and far and  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:22):**  away the cheapest and technically absolutely perfectly working way to sequester carbon  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:27):**  from the atmosphere?  
**[0:32:29-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:29):**  The biggest and best one is to create long lasting tree based ecosystems and to increase  
**[0:32:35-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:35):**  the living carbon content in the soil.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:37):**  Even though we're not measuring the soil part yet.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:39):**  But I mean, who cares as long as it stores carbon?  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:41):**  Yeah, as long as it's done, right?  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:43):**  This is more a problem for the measurement and the finance inside.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:46):**  You cannot finance anything that's not measurable, unfortunately.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:49):**  But if you can finance it even without that measure piece, then hopefully in the next  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:53):**  years it becomes possible, which means the returns become even more interesting.  
**[0:32:57-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:57):**  Yeah, we have to make it measurable.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:32:59):**  And of course it is possible.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:33:01):**  But this is a machine that has been perfected over like 500 million years or so.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:33:07):**  And if we compare it to carbon sequestration that is manmade, much more expensive by at  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:33:12):**  least a factor of 10 or so.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:33:14):**  If you look at very good books like Drawdown or similar publications.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:33:18):**  They're raising a lot of money, though, for these carbon sequestration machines in Switzerland  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:33:23):**  and some other companies are raising serious, I mean, serious 50, 60 million.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:33:27):**  Yes, no, it's a very good effort and we have to work all sides of the spectrum.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:33:32):**  And one of the problems why people, if you don't mind my saying that, prefer to invest  
**[0:33:36-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:33:36):**  into climate tech rather than soil based investments is because they think they understand tech  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:33:43):**  easier.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:33:44):**  It's easier to understand the mechanics of a tech startup than of nature.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:33:49):**  Nature is much more complex to understand.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:33:52):**  And people don't want to get their hands dirty.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:33:55):**  And so seeing that all the time and we've been asked also by various players if we want  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:00):**  to engage in climate tech.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:02):**  They said, no, absolutely not.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:05):**  We already have climate tech.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:06):**  It's called a tree and it's called soil.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:08):**  Yeah, it's much cheaper also.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:10):**  If I have to choose between something that is cheaper by a factor of 10, I mean, that's  
**[0:34:16-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:16):**  revolutionary, right?  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:17):**  So why would I want to create machines when we haven't done this first?  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:22):**  And it's neglected as well, which is a shame, but also good if you're trying to create that  
**[0:34:26-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:26):**  space.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:27):**  I wish more people were doing it, but the trees are creating this huge service to mankind  
**[0:34:32-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:32):**  and the biosphere.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:33):**  And to me, the biggest problem is the absence of investments in these tree based sustainable  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:39):**  agriculture and agroforestry.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:41):**  So only I think it's about 2% of the so called green bonds that we all know.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:48):**  And every time you see the word green bond, you think, oh, finally, somebody is investing  
**[0:34:51-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:51):**  in nature.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:53):**  But no, they're not actually.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:55):**  I think it's the maximum of 2% globally that is invested in forestry.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:34:59):**  And then often with questionable sustainability, from my perspective.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:04):**  Are you planning to raise green bonds at some point?  
**[0:35:07-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:07):**  Or thinking about, let's open it up a bit.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:09):**  Not for a while.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:10):**  I mean, a corporate bond, if you want to call a corporate bond, a green bond, then yes,  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:15):**  this is something that is in the books.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:17):**  So green bonds typically have a lot of public money in them, and that makes them incredibly  
**[0:35:22-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:22):**  slow, cumbersome.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:23):**  No, no, but like a corporate bond, like an energy company raising bond for increasing  
**[0:35:30-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:30):**  their renewable energy or stuff like that.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:32):**  That is something we are interested in looking at over the next few years.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:37):**  Interesting.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:38):**  It's sort of the next step of large amounts, because there are large amounts in the bond  
**[0:35:42-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:42):**  market.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:43):**  Yeah, there are large amounts.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:44):**  And again, it's a question of making this digestible to the normal financial investible.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:51):**  So what is being created with the green bonds today is often gigantic monocultures that  
**[0:35:57-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:35:57):**  are not the answer to the problem.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:00):**  At the same time, as I said, it's more complex than that.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:02):**  Climate change is progressing, but we're also facing this fight against mass extinction  
**[0:36:08-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:08):**  of many species of our planet.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:10):**  I think we're losing to the tune of about 50,000 animal species per year, and we're  
**[0:36:15-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:15):**  losing 130,000 kilometers of forest per year.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:19):**  So the dollar loss in biodiversity is an estimate to be about 170 billion per year.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:26):**  It's not enough to just worry about one thing.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:28):**  We need to build good soils, create maximum biodiversity in combination with these productive  
**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:34):**  and profitable ecosystems.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:36):**  That was my very long answer to the importance piece.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:41):**  That's why I'm asking, I'm starting to ask this question more and definitely give me  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:44):**  feedback if it's serving, but to understand the thinking of the gas pattern, to have a  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:49):**  sort of framework to see why you're focusing on certain things and why not on many others,  
**[0:36:54-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:54):**  because there's so many things to worry about.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:56):**  And that's exactly why I'm asking to get to the deeper part.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:36:59):**  So please, thank you so much for sharing the important space.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:02):**  And I'm curious about the rest.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:04):**  Yeah, I think for German listeners here, we need to maybe quickly translate the word tractability  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:10):**  that you used.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:11):**  Yeah, in some versions of the framework, they use solvability, but then obviously it doesn't  
**[0:37:15-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:15):**  work.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:16):**  It's ISN and they use ITN.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:17):**  So it's tractability, let's say slash solvable, like how solvable is the problem in this area?  
**[0:37:23-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:23):**  But it's a bit of a tricky word, I agree.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:25):**  And it reads a little bit like traceability, which is...  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:27):**  Yeah, I know.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:28):**  Your eyes jump to traceability and you think immediately of traceability, but that's not  
**[0:37:35-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:35):**  the case.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:36):**  So tractability means how solvable is the problem.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:40):**  And the answer to me is totally solvable.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:44):**  It's a question of energy that we're putting into it.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:47):**  And right now it's a human streak and we love to make our life as easy as possible.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:52):**  And if I am an investor, I am going to do typically everything that has always been  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:37:59):**  done, you know, and it's clean, easy and common to invest in the stock markets and in bond  
**[0:38:03-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:03):**  market and intangible paper-based liquid assets like Wirecard, for example, would be nice.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:10):**  Not even paper-based, like it's like, yeah, zeros and ones based.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:15):**  Yeah, you're right here.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:17):**  Paper is even better.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:19):**  That phase is over.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:20):**  So why bother working through tangible real assets, both understanding the nature and  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:27):**  how the underlying assets work and how everything interacts?  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:31):**  That is much more complex.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:32):**  It's much more work, actually.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:34):**  And I still see the investment community not being prepared actually to dive deeper and  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:40):**  to take that plunge, which they have to take in order to be able to judge properly and  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:46):**  to not just follow procedures and hope for the best.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:50):**  And what should they look at if they are, let's say they're listening and there's a  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:53):**  stadium full of listeners, obviously social distancing, the virtual stadium full of listeners  
**[0:38:58-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:58):**  listening to this podcast.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:38:59):**  I think, no, but we, I, my family office or the institutional investor I work with or  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:04):**  for wants to get into the space, but we don't have any experience yet.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:09):**  What should they look out for?  
**[0:39:10-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:10):**  What questions should they ask?  
**[0:39:11-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:11):**  Where should they start?  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:13):**  And then we get to the connectedness, obviously, I'm jumping around in questions, but I was  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:17):**  just curious, like, do you visit forests, do you visit farms, do you buy your own piece  
**[0:39:22-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:22):**  just to try?  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:23):**  What's the best?  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:24):**  Do you start gardening?  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:25):**  First of all, you actually look for that holistic system that I mentioned.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:30):**  You need a partner who can provide you with a holistic vision of what is supposed to happen.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:35):**  At that level, these guys don't need gurus.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:38):**  They don't need single problem solving ideas.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:43):**  They need this translated into a real workable solution from somebody who understands exactly  
**[0:39:49-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:49):**  what he's doing.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:51):**  And there are some companies around, but not very many who can actually offer that service.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:39:57):**  This is a little bit of general answer to that question, but I would look for the holistic  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:02):**  side.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:03):**  And then yes, of course, please, by all means, check out the lay of the land.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:09):**  So nobody we've ever taken into a farm has resisted or everybody who is taken also catches  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:17):**  the bug.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:18):**  That's good.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:19):**  We're not against that.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:20):**  Exactly.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:21):**  So from I mean, purely promoting what we do, it is very good to have people come and visit  
**[0:40:26-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:26):**  and actually share first hand experience to really understand what we're doing, especially  
**[0:40:30-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:30):**  in the context of social impact.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:32):**  This is something that in Germany is quite often neglected or not seen, which in France,  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:38):**  for example, is much more visual and much more asked for the aspect of putting the human  
**[0:40:43-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:43):**  beings into the center of the activity.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:45):**  What about the people?  
**[0:40:46-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:46):**  How do they cope?  
**[0:40:48-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:48):**  And how important is it that they actually make this work?  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:50):**  Yeah, we had a discussion with Oliver on that, actually, just for reference, Richard didn't  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:55):**  want to listen to the interview with Oliver, because he didn't want to be influenced by  
**[0:40:59-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:40:59):**  it.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:00):**  He will listen to it afterwards.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:01):**  But we had a discussion on the social part about that a lot of the work because this  
**[0:41:04-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:04):**  was right into lockdown.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:06):**  Obviously a lot of your work as 123 was now just to make sure that the people working  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:11):**  on the farms and on the university projects had enough to eat, because a lot of the distribution  
**[0:41:17-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:17):**  of food stopped because of lockdowns in different countries, obviously, at different times.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:20):**  But a lot of the work went into making sure of Oliver this to make sure that there was  
**[0:41:25-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:25):**  enough food for all the staff to make sure that they could go on.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:28):**  So that immediately shows the fragility of our food system, but also the focus on social  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:33):**  because obviously people need to eat also when crazy lockdowns block everything.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:39):**  One of the key problems that investors face today is that with this investment, you can  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:43):**  create a lot of value beyond the financial return.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:48):**  Because if you do it holistically, you're creating jobs, you're creating a whole ecosystem  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:52):**  doing soil improvement, biodiversity, biodiversity, you're creating a better world for the next  
**[0:41:57-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:57):**  generations.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:41:58):**  You're paying pensions, you're paying Social Security for people who have never seen Social  
**[0:42:02-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:42:02):**  Security in their lives before.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:42:04):**  So one of the fundamental questions is, of course, why does the investor have to carry  
**[0:42:10-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:42:10):**  all of that cost when all he wants is a kind of reasonably decent return?  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:42:16):**  So shouldn't the cost be spread a little bit further on more shoulders?  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:42:21):**  And that's something that we're working on to provide intelligent co-funding from other  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:42:26):**  partners that are interested in different parts of different pieces of this value chain.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:42:32):**  And that it could be foundations that are interested in biodiversity, for example, or  
**[0:42:36-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:42:36):**  it could be the state of the host country.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:42:39):**  I've been speaking to ministers or presidents to ask them for support in actually saying,  
**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:42:46):**  look, we are solving one of your problems in terms of Social Security, providing pension  
**[0:42:51-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:42:51):**  payments, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:42:53):**  What can you do to help us?  
**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:42:55):**  How can you help us succeed and that not one single investor has to carry all of those  
**[0:43:00-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:00):**  costs?  
**[0:43:01-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:01):**  So it means that, for example, it could be on the taxation side that there is a promotional  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:06):**  taxation for truly ecological investments, which is often the case, et cetera.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:12):**  So this is another piece to watch out for that you don't necessarily have to shoulder  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:17):**  all of the cost alone.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:19):**  And the last one may be that is one of my favorite demands is that we need a higher  
**[0:43:25-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:25):**  carbon price.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:26):**  We need a higher price for...  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:27):**  I mean, it recovered a bit over the last months or year or so, but yeah, definitely it's not  
**[0:43:33-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:33):**  nearly the true cost it should be.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:36):**  We are on a good track.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:37):**  A fascinating news is that, I mean, in Germany, we have a carbon price of 25 euros or a carbon  
**[0:43:42-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:42):**  taxation 25 euros per ton as of 21 and 55 euros as of 25.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:48):**  Wow.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:49):**  So 50 euros per ton is the point where...  
**[0:43:53-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:53):**  It starts to hurt.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:54):**  Well, it starts to hurt some, but it also...  
**[0:43:57-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:57):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:43:59):**  Forestry can be funded almost purely from carbon revenues.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:04):**  So this is really interesting.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:05):**  If this is being translated at some point into the market for carbon compensation, then  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:12):**  we have a very good chance to reforest the planet based on carbon pricing.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:17):**  And I know Sweden, I think is, do correct me if I'm wrong, somewhere around 100, 140  
**[0:44:23-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:23):**  already euros per ton and they're just increasing.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:25):**  I mean, it's not a gigantic country, but it shows what is possible.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:30):**  And the voluntary market, I think the European market in general has been, the price has  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:33):**  been moving up even in this crisis or have been stable and it's sort of back at 25 as  
**[0:44:39-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:39):**  well.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:40):**  I mean, let's see what happens after.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:42):**  We started this with Canada left and the whole thing collapsed and it could happen in Germany.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:47):**  The government's changed and 2025, we never get to 50, but let's say next year, 25 is  
**[0:44:52-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:52):**  a start and it becomes sort of ingrained in the system, too late and too slow, but still.  
**[0:44:57-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:44:58):**  If we then we need the necessary legislation to translate that into forestry and agroforestry  
**[0:45:02-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:02):**  projects, which is not there today because the voluntary market is much slower than that.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:07):**  And would that be like the one thing you would change?  
**[0:45:10-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:10):**  I'm asking the magic wand question quite often.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:12):**  Like if there's one thing you would change tomorrow morning and we all wake up in a world  
**[0:45:16-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:16):**  where Richard has changed something.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:19):**  Would that be a 50, 100, 150 dollar carbon price or euro or would it be something completely  
**[0:45:24-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:24):**  different?  
**[0:45:25-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:26):**  Could I have two wishes?  
**[0:45:27-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:27):**  Of course, of course.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:28):**  The one key factor, if we could have a carbon pricing for forestry and sustainable forestry  
**[0:45:35-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:35):**  that is close to, let's say $50 or so, this would be revolutionary and would trigger a  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:44):**  global reforestation initiative like we have never seen before.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:49):**  This would be a total game changer.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:52):**  There would have to be a guarantee, though, that it is there for the longer term.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:55):**  Of course.  
**[0:45:56-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:56):**  Because as you said, in the Kyoto Protocol, the problem was that the price is fluctuating  
**[0:45:59-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:45:59):**  so much.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:46:00):**  There's such a volatility that you never know where you come out of.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:46:03):**  And if you invest a million today, you may lose it tomorrow.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:46:07):**  So if it's a tax, if it's based on taxation or on a similar kind of rigid system, you  
**[0:46:13-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:46:13):**  know that, OK, it's here to stay, we're not throwing this out overboard tomorrow.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:46:19):**  So that's one.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:46:21):**  The other one is more an agricultural one.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:46:24):**  I think it would be great, and this is fantasy, it would be great to have a mandatory sustainability  
**[0:46:30-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:46:30):**  scorecard for all agricultural products and that the sales of products underneath a certain  
**[0:46:37-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:46:37):**  sustainability threshold should be prohibited.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:46:41):**  That forces that all agricultural production is forced into a certain sustainability that  
**[0:46:47-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:46:47):**  is becoming sensical, that just makes sense.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:46:51):**  Like soil health, energy use, inputs.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:46:54):**  You delete all the practices that are detrimental and that everybody says...  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:46:59):**  Basically, you would like to walk into a supermarket with your wand and probably 95% of the products  
**[0:47:04-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:04):**  disappear overnight.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:06):**  And the few that are, and then giving space to those two and to the others that want to  
**[0:47:09-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:09):**  change.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:10):**  Anyway, yeah, that would be maybe my second one.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:14):**  I think you were allowed to have two.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:15):**  I want to thank, I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:18):**  I think we answered honestly the neglectiveness, which is a word I keep struggling, but we  
**[0:47:22-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:22):**  keep improving.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:23):**  I mean, I think we've answered that throughout the podcast.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:26):**  You wish there were many more focusing on this and you see the interest growing and  
**[0:47:30-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:30):**  maybe even with the carbon price and with actually the success you're having and some  
**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:34):**  others that there will be more operators, there will be more asset managers like we've  
**[0:47:38-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:38):**  seen in renewable energy.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:39):**  I mean, there were a few crazy ones 20 years ago and now there is an industry that is doing  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:43):**  this with prices that obviously are way lower than we could ever imagined and with investments  
**[0:47:48-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:48):**  way higher than we could ever imagine.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:50):**  I think the neglectedness is a good last point because I think it is changing also radically.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:47:57):**  I've never felt this before as a feeder today, that we are on the verge of real change when  
**[0:48:02-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:02):**  it comes to the anticipation and realization of climate change impact.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:07):**  I think it's with the kids taking to the street, Fridays for Future.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:11):**  I think this is probably the biggest wake up call that I've seen in a long time in the  
**[0:48:16-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:16):**  perception of people.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:17):**  I'm not talking about myself because we've been in the bubble for 15 years and people  
**[0:48:23-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:23):**  are finally starting to take some of this seriously, although they wish that it would  
**[0:48:27-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:27):**  just go away.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:29):**  Somebody please make this go away.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:30):**  Let's buy some electric cars and get some panels and we'll be fine.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:34):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:35):**  But still, it's a step.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:36):**  It's not the realistic way we would like, but it's a step.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:40):**  To maybe end this on a positive note, if I may, we're seeing the biggest polluters in  
**[0:48:45-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:45):**  the world, huge energy companies will turn into the largest renewable energy producers  
**[0:48:51-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:51):**  in the world.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:52):**  We're seeing energy companies establishing living carbon portfolios.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:48:56):**  This is something they've never heard that notion before.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:49:00):**  We're seeing car companies, not just offsets, but real forests.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:49:05):**  So there's a huge change going on right now in realizing that this is real, that it's  
**[0:49:11-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:49:11):**  life threatening, and that everybody, especially industry, who has been calling for tougher  
**[0:49:17-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:49:17):**  climate regulations for a long, long time, is really coming to the table now.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:49:23):**  And our financial investors, especially institutional investors, by necessity, they cannot be pioneers.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:49:28):**  They cannot be leaders in this normally.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:49:31):**  Their mandate is actually to keep money secure and to pay pensions, so they must by necessity  
**[0:49:37-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:49:37):**  be followers.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:49:38):**  But there is huge progress today in creating the framework actually that allows also step  
**[0:49:44-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:49:44):**  by step for the biggest investors in the world to come on board for forestry and agroforestry  
**[0:49:50-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:49:50):**  sustainable investments.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:49:52):**  I think that's a perfect note to end.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:49:55):**  Thank you so much, Richard, for this deep dive into the world of agroforestry, institutional  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:50:00):**  investors and what needs to be done and is already happening to really get, let's say,  
**[0:50:05-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:50:05):**  the larger pots of money flowing into this space.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:50:08):**  Yeah, thanks very much for giving me the possibility to air my views here and apologies to all

**[0:50:18-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:50:18):**  Absolutely not.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:50:19):**  I think it was great.

**[0:51:20-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:51:20):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:51:22-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:51:22):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:51:27-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:51:27):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following this space since 2011 and recording

**[0:52:14-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:52:14):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:52:16):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:52:19-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:52:19):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:52:30-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:52:30):**  No.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:52:31):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:52:33):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:52:38-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:52:38):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:52:43):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:52:48-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:52:48):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:52:51):**  Thank you.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:52:52):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:52:53-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:52:53):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:52:59-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:52:59):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:53:01):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:53:06-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:53:06):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:53:12-0:53:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:53:12):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:53:16-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:53:16):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:53:18):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:53:23-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:53:23):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:53:27):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:53:31):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:53:32-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:53:32):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:53:34):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:53:37):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:53:40):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:53:42):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/28/richard-focken#t=0:53:48):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:00:12):**  Now on to the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:00:14):**  In this interview we dive deeper into what kind of systems thinking is necessary to design  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:00:18):**  investment products that really help farmers to transition towards regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:00:24):**  For instance a loan where the interest payments are tied to measurable changes in soil health.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:00:29):**  And why farmers should be involved in every conversation and should be on the board of  
**[0:00:34-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:00:34):**  any food, agriculture, agtech, but honestly any company.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:00:49):**  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:00:52):**  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:00:56):**  Why are we recording this series?  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:00:58):**  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:01):**  They have looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the gurus on their  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:06):**  farms, explored farm size regenerative designs and most importantly started their pilots  
**[0:01:11-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:11):**  and feedback loops.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:12):**  This is where transition finance is key.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:15):**  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of flexibility  
**[0:01:20-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:20):**  and the farmers lack of collateral.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:22):**  Furthermore there is a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give away.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:28):**  That is why my co-host aspiring to be regenerative farmer Benedikt BÃ¶sel and I are embarking  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:34):**  on a journey to find out what are the key principles of transition finance for regenerative  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:39):**  farmers.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:40):**  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative agriculture and food finance  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:45):**  space.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:46):**  They share their insights how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative transition  
**[0:01:50-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:50):**  on Benedikt's 1000 hectares which is almost 2500 acres farm in Germany close to Berlin.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:57):**  This is an open process.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:01:58):**  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:02):**  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:05):**  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you have seen, other inspiration,

**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:22):**  Robin O'Brien is the co-founder of Replant Capital, a new financial services firm.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:27):**  Replant is creating financial products which addresses the most pressing issue of our time,  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:31):**  climate change.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:32):**  Through a series of innovative captive funds focused on direct investments, Replant is  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:36):**  partnering with farmers, ranchers, large food companies and technical assistance providers  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:41):**  to facilitate more resilient agriculture practices at scale.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:45):**  Welcome Robin.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:46):**  Thanks so much for having me.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:47):**  And welcome to this podcast on transition finance.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:49):**  We both of us are very much looking forward to dive deeper into this topic.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:53):**  But first a short intro.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:55):**  We never had you on the podcast.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:02:56):**  What brings you to food, ag, soil and obviously Replant Capital, but let's stay.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:01):**  What brings you to food and ag?  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:02):**  So my career has always been in the food industry.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:05):**  I went to business school at Rice University and when I graduated, I joined a team and  
**[0:03:09-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:09):**  we managed $20 billion in assets.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:11):**  I was the only female on the team.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:12):**  So the guys had me cover the food industry.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:14):**  So I learned the industry early on in my career in a very analytical way.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:18):**  It was just simply data, earnings, just the statistics.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:23):**  And then flash forward a few years, we had four children and all of a sudden I was looking  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:27):**  at the food industry through the lens of a mother, as well as the lens that I had had  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:31):**  prior to this financial analyst.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:34):**  And thankfully my mom is actually from New Zealand.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:36):**  And so I was born with this dual citizenship and this sort of dual lens on the world, one  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:41):**  being seeing it through the ways that we do things as Americans and then the other through  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:45):**  my mother's eyes, which was as a New Zealander.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:48):**  And she was always saying, just because we do it one way here doesn't mean the rest of  
**[0:03:51-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:51):**  the world does it that way.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:52):**  And I grew up hearing that a lot over a lot of different things.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:03:55):**  And so when our children started to get sick, my first place was, okay, well, what can I  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:00):**  be doing in food?  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:01):**  And how can I be maybe better handling this as a mother when it comes to feeding the kids?  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:07):**  On top of that, we were thrown into the challenge of food allergies and the food allergy world  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:11):**  in the United States, it's massive.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:13):**  The universe has grown so fast and unfortunately it impacts so many families.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:17):**  And my big question was why?  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:19):**  And so as I really started digging into food, quickly kind of landed on this big question  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:23):**  was, are we allergic to food or are we allergic to what's been done to it?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:27):**  And as I began to ask that question, there were certain agrochemical companies that were  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:31):**  really upset that I was asking the question.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:33):**  There were other big CPG process food companies that also were really upset that I was asking  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:36):**  the question, but I couldn't not ask the question.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:39):**  And so as I began to dig deeper into that, I reached back out to my analysts that I had  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:43):**  worked with at different companies like Goldman Sachs and Maryland, all these different analysts  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:47):**  and relationships that I had there.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:49):**  I was also reaching out into the pediatric world because now as a mother of four, I had  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:53):**  resources there and really trying to understand what we did not know about our food system  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:04:58):**  and how it might be impacting the developing immune system of a child.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:02):**  I launched Allergy Kids Foundation.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:04):**  We built an advisory board of people from the food industry and of course a medical  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:08):**  advisory board who could inform us around that.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:11):**  And as it continued to grow, it was really interesting.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:13):**  I mean, I had different opportunities, Random House published my book, The Unhealthy Truth.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:17):**  I was invited to give a TED talk.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:19):**  That was probably one of the most terrifying moments of my life.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:23):**  But what was so interesting about that is that that talk was translated into dozens  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:27):**  of languages.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:28):**  And so it really lands with where we are today and that this is really a global challenge.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:32):**  We have a global opportunity in front of all of us to take the food system that we've inherited  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:37):**  and say, do we want to embrace this going forward and what pieces are actually needed  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:42):**  and required to build a food system that works for the 21st century?  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:47):**  And it's not just for the 21st century consumer that now has diabetes or food allergies or  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:51):**  autism, Alzheimer's or cancer or any of these conditions now hammering so many of us, but  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:05:57):**  it's also how do you actually build a food system that works for the farmer?  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:00):**  And where we landed with Replant is the fact that in the United States, and it's not just  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:05):**  in the United States, New Zealand has a similar problem, farmers are now carrying massive,  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:10):**  massive levels of debt.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:12):**  And when you are strapped into debt, you don't have the freedom or flexibility to even  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:16):**  consider what might be possible.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:19):**  And so what we've seen is there was this amazing PR campaign, this amazing financial campaign  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:26):**  to really sell farmers in the United States on this operating system that is genetically  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:30):**  engineered and chemically intensive.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:33):**  And it made a ton of sense for the chemical company Monsanto that was introducing it because  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:36):**  all of a sudden they were introducing a whole bunch of new revenue lines.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:40):**  Instead of just selling their signature Roundup, they were selling Roundup ready soybeans and  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:43):**  Roundup ready corn.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:44):**  And all of a sudden, farmers were paying licensing fees and trade fees and royalty fees.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:49):**  So their business model just blew up with the introduction of genetically engineered  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:53):**  crops because they could charge all of these different fees to the US farmer.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:06:58):**  And as they did that, farmers were taking out more and more debt, taking on more and  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:02):**  more loans in order to finance this transition into this chemically intensive operating system.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:08):**  To the point now that US farmers carry over $426 billion in debt.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:14):**  And the average median farm income now is somewhere around negative 1,500 bucks.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:19):**  And so as I was learning that data, I thought, what happens to a country that doesn't have  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:26):**  farmers?  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:27):**  And as I spoke to farmers, they were saying, my own kids don't want to step into this operating  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:33):**  model.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:34):**  They don't want to step into the debt levels.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:35):**  They don't want to step into the chemical loads.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:37):**  They're not interested in being on the hook like this.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:40):**  And so the children of the farmers now in the United States, there's a real legacy issue  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:44):**  on the farm.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:45):**  And that has really awakened this crisis, even more so than the opioid epidemics we're  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:50):**  seeing, more so than the suicide epidemics, more than the bankruptcies that we're seeing.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:07:55):**  I think the legacy issue is probably one of the strongest reasons we're starting to see  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:00):**  real change in the US.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:02):**  And where the farmers come in, and they can come into us at Preplant.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:05):**  They're in conversations with companies like Anheuser-Busch and Bev.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:08):**  They're in conversations with companies like General Mills or Patagonia or Dr. Bronner's.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:13):**  The farmers are coming in and saying, I don't know how to transition.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:17):**  I don't know on the technical side.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:19):**  All I've known is this chemically intensive operating system.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:21):**  I don't know how I'm going to finance this transition, because if it takes three years  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:25):**  to go from conventional agriculture to organic agriculture, what happens in that three-year  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:29):**  period?  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:30):**  And then I don't know who's going to be a guaranteed buyer as I come out the other end  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:34):**  of that three-year period.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:35):**  So we sort of looked at the problem and realized there was an enormous opportunity to come  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:41):**  in as a value-aligned, really well-educated capital partner and help the US farmers finance  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:46):**  this transition.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:48):**  So as we were having conversations with companies like General Mills and Nestle, they were saying,  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:52):**  we're bottlenecked.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:53):**  We know that the consumer in the United States wants more regenerative organic food.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:08:58):**  And 80% of consumers now in the US are purchasing something organic.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:02):**  25% of all of our grocery store categories now carry something organic.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:06):**  But only 1% of farmland in the United States is organic.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:10):**  And a percentage of a percentage of a percentage of that, even a tiny slice of that, is even  
**[0:09:15-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:15):**  regenerative.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:16):**  So we saw that as an enormous opportunity to really help fund and close that gap.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:22):**  And the challenge is that a lot of these publicly traded companies, their shareholders, their  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:27):**  capital is coming from the publicly traded markets.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:30):**  And so on that quarterly earnings model, the demands are so extreme and so intense and  
**[0:09:35-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:35):**  so high.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:36):**  And I say that from an all-knowing perspective because we did that as a team.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:40):**  We demanded so much from these publicly traded companies that they couldn't even consider  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:46):**  beyond the next quarter.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:47):**  They couldn't consider a three-year transition period to organics.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:51):**  So we stepped back and thought, how do we create a capital source that can help come  
**[0:09:55-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:09:55):**  in beside these large CPG companies, work with the farmers, provide the technical expertise  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:10:03):**  that is required by the farmers to then begin the transition process?  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:10:08):**  And then by having the relationships with these large companies like Danone, or Anheuser-Busch  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:10:12):**  & Bev, or Driscoll, some of these big companies, you're bringing in a guaranteed buyer.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:10:16):**  And so it's mitigating the risk for the farmer.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:10:19):**  And so for us, that was really, as we started to really land on that as a solution, we realized  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:10:24):**  that it was an incredible opportunity not just for us here in the United States, but  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:10:29):**  really farmers around the world.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:10:31):**  So our attitude was clearly, this is critically important.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:10:36):**  And how can we open source what we're doing so that more people have access to it?  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:10:41):**  So I'm really excited to be on this with you guys today.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:10:44):**  Wow, Robin, I got to give it to you.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:10:48):**  I am always fascinated by these kind of people who are able to explain the most complex situation  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:10:54):**  and concepts in so nice and easy and fluid words.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:10:59):**  If I would want to say the same smart things that you just said, I would probably need  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:02):**  55 minutes and no one would listen to me.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:04):**  So thank you so much for that.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:07):**  That's really something to aim for.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:09):**  But I mean, you covered just basically the whole idea and background of the podcast,  
**[0:11:14-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:14):**  right?  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:15):**  I mean, there's pretty much anything you said is really why we're speaking right now.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:19):**  And I think for me, one of the most interesting parts, I guess, is that the question of the  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:26):**  deptness or being in debt and the dependency of farmers.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:30):**  I think this is such a crucial point because it has to do with rural development in such  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:35):**  a strong way, right?  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:36):**  I mean, we have to empower farmers.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:38):**  Farmers are the ones and the only ones in that regard who can do all those kind of things  
**[0:11:44-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:44):**  that we all want, biodiversity, climate mitigation, healthy food, and I mean, food as medicine  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:51):**  basically, right?  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:53):**  Providing in the rural area.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:54):**  I mean, this is what farmers basically do and we need to help them.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:11:58):**  We have to be able to give them the tools and the services that they need in order to  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:12:03):**  do what we all want, right?  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:12:05):**  And as of today, I think it's more a situation where everyone has good advice and everyone  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:12:10):**  has an opinion and everyone has a good product that someone can buy, but really helping in  
**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:12:15):**  the end of the day, that's very few, right?  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:12:18):**  And coming to regenerative agriculture, I mean, when you talk about it and we look at  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:12:24):**  the visionaries all over the world, everyone is like, oh my God, that's great.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:12:29):**  Why don't we all do it?  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:12:30):**  Why don't everyone change, right?  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:12:33):**  And from the situation in Germany, what I see, and obviously that's very limited, but  
**[0:12:38-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:12:38):**  it's still something that is really in our area, is there's certain situations that different  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:12:47):**  farms are in.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:12:49):**  First thing is in our area where we have very sandy soil and low precipitation, farmers  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:12:55):**  are fighting for their lives, fighting for the farms each and every day.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:12:59):**  They don't have the emotional freedom to think beyond what they're already doing to keep  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:04):**  it alive, right?  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:05):**  So we cannot ask them to do any changes.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:08):**  And Falka Engelsmann from Eostar always says, how can I think green if my figures are red,  
**[0:13:13-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:13):**  right?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:14):**  I mean, that puts it beautifully.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:15):**  So that's one part.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:16):**  The other one is they have invested into, let's say a big store, they've invested into  
**[0:13:21-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:21):**  some sort of model of how they do their farm business and the bank wants to have the annuity  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:30):**  payments.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:31):**  They don't care what you think would be good for animal health or whatever.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:36):**  They will ask for the money and you're stuck in that system of paying back basically the  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:40):**  debt obligation that you have.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:42):**  So they can't change either, even if they want to, or they have really good soil, really  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:47):**  good water, and they're earning a lot.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:50):**  They even get government subsidies on it.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:51):**  So why would they change the system, right?  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:13:54):**  So there's these different kind of situations that farmers are in, depending on, let's say,  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:00):**  the environment they're also faced in, where it is really a matter of, can you get out  
**[0:14:06-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:06):**  of it?  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:07):**  And if so, how?  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:08):**  And that brings in that whole aspect of, we need a financial product that guides them  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:13):**  and that helps them, that is a partner in that process.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:17):**  That is basically, Cooney always say, they sit on the same side of the table, right?  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:22):**  And I think that's really the core of this series on an alternative way of, let's say,  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:28):**  financing farmers that are in transition.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:31):**  I agree completely.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:32):**  And it's been really interesting.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:33):**  I mean, I think your point, how can we think grain when our fingers are red?  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:38):**  We see that here too, where we sit down with farmers across the United States and just  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:42):**  as across Europe, you'd have different soil types and climates and water issues, depending  
**[0:14:46-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:46):**  on the country that you're in.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:47):**  Here in the US, the states are very much like that.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:49):**  So if we're talking to farmers in Texas or California or Minnesota or Nebraska, there  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:54):**  can be different sets of issues.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:14:56):**  And as we initially were in those conversations to come in and support and try to work with  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:03):**  them on these solutions that they needed, it was really interesting.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:05):**  It was exactly your point.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:07):**  It was, I can't think green.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:10):**  I don't even have the time, the space, the bandwidth, the capacity.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:13):**  I am literally trying to get through this day to day to day, especially as you throw  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:18):**  in all of these different issues like droughts and floods and the issues that are tied to  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:22):**  climate and whether the farmers are now being impacted by, they're really just trying to  
**[0:15:27-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:27):**  solve for that day to day.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:28):**  And where we landed as a team was how do we offer sort of a menu of solutions that is  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:35):**  very well informed by our technical assistance partners, by farmers that we have worked with  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:40):**  and by the food companies.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:42):**  How can we actually provide that list of different opportunities for farmers to partner with  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:48):**  us so that they have the capital that they need to deploy, whatever their unique situation  
**[0:15:52-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:52):**  might be.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:53):**  And I think as you speak to farmers and these big food companies that are in the conversation  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:15:57):**  of how do we convert from conventional, chemically intensive agriculture to regenerative agriculture  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:03):**  to build soil health, simple things.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:06):**  It's things like cover crop seeds that need to be purchased and maybe there's different  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:10):**  equipment needs that need to be financed.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:14):**  Depending on the crop, when we talk to Driscolls, the farm worker issue there is so critical.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:20):**  It's absolutely critical and some of the issues they're seeing on their farms revolve around  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:24):**  things like childcare.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:25):**  So again, it's really this very holistic systems thinking that's required.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:30):**  And unfortunately, I don't know, I can't speak to Italy or Germany, but here in the US we  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:36):**  lost sight of that a long time ago.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:38):**  Can you walk us through an example, like a farm and try to describe it as visually, obviously,  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:44):**  as we're in a podcast and as possible, like one of the farms and farmers you've worked  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:48):**  with and what were the items on the menu you shared and what were the items that ended  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:55):**  up working for that farmer?  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:56):**  Because I think the holistic view obviously is absolutely critical.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:16:59):**  And then at the same time I hear the investor voice in the back of my mind saying, yeah,  
**[0:17:03-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:03):**  but it needs to be standardized.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:04):**  Otherwise we cannot scale and we cannot replicate it.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:07):**  So there's a constant tension between flexibility and a lot of different options and running  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:12):**  out of time, we need to probably transition.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:16):**  I don't know how many millions of farmers.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:18):**  So how do we do that?  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:19):**  So can you walk us through one example or two examples that really give a great way  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:25):**  of seeing basically the toolbox you have, the menu you've been working with?  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:29):**  So I think probably the first thing that comes to mind is the technical expertise and the  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:34):**  technical assistance that is required on the farm, which is a farmer to farmer thing.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:39):**  They don't want to hear from us.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:40):**  They don't want to hear from some finance group in Oakland or Boulder.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:44):**  They want to hear from those people on the ground who can actually assist them in that  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:49):**  technical transition and in the know-how.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:51):**  And so for us, it's so critically important that we bring on these technical assistance  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:17:56):**  partners and one of them, Ecopractices, they're extraordinary.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:00):**  They are definitely our knowledge base on so much of this.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:04):**  When we have a question around farmer needs, we go to them.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:07):**  They're Kansas and Missouri based and they're able to inform us on what they're seeing directly  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:11):**  on the ground in their communities.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:13):**  Again, it's a localized solution.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:16):**  And so if we're working with farmers in Ohio, that technical assistance partner is going  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:21):**  to look very different because a lot of the farmers in Ohio are Amish and therefore they're  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:25):**  not using technology.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:27):**  So how do you actually work to create some of these solutions that normally involve technological  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:33):**  platforms or at the very least cell phones and how can you work with the Amish farmers  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:37):**  in this transition process?  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:39):**  What's been really interesting there is just in the last couple of years, the farmers have  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:43):**  embraced using cell phone technology on farm during daylight hours to better inform them  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:48):**  around soil health and around the practices and the better practices, especially in transition.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:54):**  But I think the biggest needs that we're hearing are cover crop.  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:57):**  It's around cover cropping.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:18:59):**  I think that when a farmer has been growing conventionally using the agrochemicals suite  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:04):**  of portfolio for the last 20 years to really kind of start with something as simple as  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:10):**  cover crops, it does not feel intimidating.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:13):**  It feels accessible.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:15):**  You then quickly step into the needs that would be required for equipment.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:20):**  Another area that we're focusing on is water conservation, water metrics.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:24):**  And so different farmers, especially when we're talking to dairy farmers, they're really  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:28):**  interested in how they can be smarter about water conservation on their farm.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:33):**  So again, we sort of, for the last 20 years under Monsanto and companies like that, we've  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:38):**  lived under this model of one size fits all.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:41):**  And that's what actually broke agriculture.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:43):**  What we're stepping back from is sort of saying, let's actually decentralize this and let's  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:48):**  honor the fact that we localize these solutions.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:51):**  It's not one size fits all.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:52):**  You lean into the expertise of a given region or area or collection of farmers and you work  
**[0:19:58-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:58):**  specifically with them.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:19:59):**  So again, for us, it's, we're not here to dictate what that is.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:02):**  We're here to sit down at the table and figure out how to finance it.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:06):**  And you would end up financing the cover crops for this farmer, or you would end up financing  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:10):**  the water sensors, et cetera, to the moisture sensors to help save water.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:15):**  That would be the part replant does, or how would that work?  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:18):**  That's part of what we do.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:19):**  We think of it as a pie chart.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:21):**  So it's like, definitely that's a piece of the pie.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:23):**  Those are pieces of the pie.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:25):**  We're also hearing from farmers who, as they began their transition to organic agriculture,  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:30):**  they were very much conventional using a bunch of chemical inputs.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:34):**  As they shifted to regenerative, they felt that was probably the most reachable.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:39):**  And so as they shifted from conventional to regenerative, what they saw was an improvement  
**[0:20:43-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:43):**  in soil health.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:45):**  They were able to save half a million bucks a year on chemical inputs.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:49):**  And then all of a sudden, once they're in that regenerative space, the few steps out  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:54):**  to organic don't feel as far away.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:20:57):**  And they can see that if they were to go all the way to organic, there's a premium there  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:00):**  for those crops.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:01):**  So where regenerative has enabled enormous cost savings, organic then enables that premium  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:08):**  on that side in terms of when they're selling their crops into the market.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:11):**  And so we have heard from farmers who, once they're in motion like that, they're like,  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:15):**  look, I have 7,000 acres under management that are organic.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:20):**  I want to acquire 2,000 more.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:23):**  So it's, again, helping that farmer finance that acquisition and that expansion to more  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:29):**  organic acreage.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:31):**  It's really important distinction because we are starting with the soil fund and it  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:34):**  is a loan fund.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:36):**  And it's really kind of getting at these debt levels and really helping to tackle it and  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:40):**  really helping to bring it down so that the farmer has more flexibility and more autonomy  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:45):**  in his decision making because we see that that's part of the problem.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:49):**  I mean, you can't, with so much debt and so much that's required under that debt, there  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:54):**  hasn't been a whole lot of breathing room for the farmer.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:21:57):**  So by coming in really as a loan fund, that's our focus.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:22:00):**  A lot of people have said, well, would you want to buy the, do you want to buy the land?  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:22:04):**  We don't want to be landlords.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:22:05):**  That's not the business model that we're creating.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:22:07):**  It's really the soil funds or loan funds that are really helping figure out how we can help  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:22:13):**  farmers transition their crops to regenerative organic agriculture.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:22:18):**  What I always think in this regard, and you mentioned it, or you touched upon this quite  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:22:24):**  nicely just now, like we always, when we think agriculture, when we talk agriculture, what  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:22:30):**  we all think of all the time is primary production of food.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:22:35):**  And obviously that's what we're doing.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:22:39):**  And then this starts at basically two routes of thinking about this.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:22:44):**  On one side, this goes back to the whole idea of true cost accounting or true cost of food.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:22:49):**  We think about the negative externalities of our production model and we try to basically  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:22:54):**  monitor them and monetize them and say, okay, basically we have to reduce those negative  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:22:59):**  consequences of the production models.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:23:01):**  And then you can split that up between conventional, organic, regenerative, whatever it is.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:23:06):**  That's coming from basically the more negative side.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:23:10):**  But I prefer to look at it the other way around and think about what kind of values do we  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:23:17):**  actually create by doing what we're doing.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:23:20):**  So obviously we're producing food, but we're also taking care of the land.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:23:24):**  We're also taking care of the animals.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:23:26):**  We also take care of basically the aesthetics of it.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:23:29):**  We also take care of the environment in some way.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:23:32):**  And that has value to it.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:23:34):**  It has value that you can basically monitor, you can monetize it.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:23:38):**  So when we talk about climate change, when we talk about the kind of problems that we  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:23:44):**  face as a society on a worldwide level, don't we have to completely change the talk and  
**[0:23:50-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:23:50):**  the topic and the view how we see basically agriculturalists, but also people who are  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:23:57):**  in the forestry who actually do take care of the land.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:24:00):**  They're basically caretakers of the land and they produce food, but they have so many other  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:24:05):**  tasks that they fulfill.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:24:07):**  And don't we have to think in a whole new way of basically paying for those kinds of  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:24:13):**  services that they basically do for all of us, right?  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:24:17):**  Well, I think you're starting to see that with the emergence of this B Corp certification  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:24:23):**  and J. Cohen Gilbert is a friend of our teams and one of my co-founders, Don Schaefer, he  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:24:27):**  was on the founding board of B Corp and B Lab.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:24:31):**  And I think, again, it's a much more encompassing value system in terms of those models.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:24:38):**  And I agree completely.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:24:39):**  The farmer, unfortunately, the language around farming in the United States and it sounds  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:24:45):**  like around the world was focused on yield and that that was the only value that a farmer  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:24:50):**  was producing was yield.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:24:53):**  And when we sit down with farmers here in the United States now, they're like, that  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:24:56):**  was so misguided to only focus on yield because soil health has been destroyed in some cases,  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:03):**  profitability has been destroyed.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:04):**  There's bankruptcy, there's mental health crisis that's happening on the farm.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:08):**  By only focusing on yield, we ignored so much.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:12):**  And if you can step back and say, okay, let's think about it.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:15):**  What if we were to focus on profitability for the farmer?  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:18):**  What would that actually look like?  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:20):**  That includes exactly what you're saying, which is building soil health.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:23):**  So as a financial services firm that's in this space, our loans are tied to soil health  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:29):**  and no one's ever done that before, but it's why we have these third party partners because  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:35):**  they offer metrics for us that help inform us on the terms of our loan.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:39):**  And so a farmer, if he is demonstrating improved soil health, higher organic nutrient density  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:46):**  in the soil health, water conservation, water infiltration, carbon sequestration, those  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:50):**  are all things that you can measure when it comes to soil health.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:54):**  The stronger those metrics are, the lower his cost of capital.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:25:58):**  And to really think about aligning the incentives because he's already doing the work or she's  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:03):**  already doing that work, but she's never been compensated for it directly.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:08):**  And so by tying the cost of capital to the health of the soil, you're actually being  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:14):**  compensated directly for those better practices.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:17):**  So instead of the focus only being on yield, all of a sudden we've said, hey, you know  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:21):**  what, our focus is on soil health and these are the metrics and these are the way that  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:25):**  we're capturing it.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:27):**  And just to give an understanding, what is the, because this is revolutionary, as you  
**[0:26:31-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:31):**  said, I haven't heard anybody connecting soil health specifically to the cost of capital.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:39):**  What is the range that it fluctuates as an example, if you have an example, like is it  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:43):**  a significant difference if I, as a farmer work really, really hard to improve my soil  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:48):**  health?  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:49):**  Do I see that and like significantly back in a lower cost of capital?  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:53):**  I think, you know, for us, I wish I had more data to give you as it relates to that, but  
**[0:26:57-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:57):**  we're right out of the gate.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:26:58):**  So I don't, unfortunately right now.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:27:00):**  But what I will say is that by having partners like Danone that are B Corp certified and  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:27:05):**  thinking much more in terms of stakeholders, not just shareholders, it enables us to deliver  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:27:10):**  those returns at the farm level in a way that hasn't happened before.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:27:15):**  And so for example, with Danone, you know, if there's a third party technical assistance  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:27:19):**  partner in some cases they say, you know, we're going to step in and we're actually  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:27:23):**  going to cover the cost of that because we understand the value that it's bringing to  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:27:27):**  our supply chain.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:27:28):**  So again, you know, it's recognizing that the most critical piece in the food system  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:27:32):**  is actually happening at the soil level, which the farmer is a steward of.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:27:37):**  And so to really bring that into the conversation, what has been absolutely shocking is how few  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:27:43):**  of these large global food companies actually have those direct relationships with their  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:27:48):**  growers and with their farmers.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:27:50):**  Danone is extraordinary because they know they're 700 plus dairy farmers.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:27:56):**  And Heiser Busch and Bev is the same way, they've got over 700 barley growers, they  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:00):**  have direct relationships with them.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:01):**  Driscoll's is another one.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:03):**  They have over 700 family farmers.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:05):**  They've got absolutely direct relationships with them.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:08):**  And I think again, you know, we step out of the 20th century into the 21st century and  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:13):**  that transparency is required for a successful food system.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:16):**  So the companies that don't have that direct relationship with their farmers and with their  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:21):**  growers and that really are kind of blind to the procurement side of things, they're  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:25):**  quickly trying to get to know them, which is great.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:29):**  But I think, you know, again, it's not a one size fits all model.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:33):**  So it's going to depend brand to brand and really kind of the types of fields that the  
**[0:28:39-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:39):**  farmers are managing, how that equation is actually going to play out.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:42):**  And would you be able to share, I mean, not now probably, but you mentioned open source,  
**[0:28:47-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:47):**  your process obviously before, like how do you connect a loan product to the soil health?  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:55):**  Like what, which obviously is going to be different in different parts, but I'm imagining  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:28:59):**  that in a few months or maybe in a year when this is going, how do you actually do that?  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:04):**  Because I think a lot of people would say, wow, sounds amazing, but sounds also very  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:08):**  complicated.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:09):**  I mean, I think it would be if you didn't have partners like we have with eco practices.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:13):**  So that team is a bunch of agronomists with a bunch of just absolute data jockeys.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:18):**  So they're able to capture this information as it relates to soil health, everything we're  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:22):**  talking about, carbon, nutrient density, organic matter, water conservation, they can capture  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:26):**  those metrics.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:27):**  And again, that's been the focus of their business model is eco practices, capturing  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:31):**  the metrics of soil health.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:33):**  So by bringing them in as a third party partner, not as something that's part of replant, but  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:37):**  as something that is independent of us, they're actually reporting on that data and those  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:41):**  metrics.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:42):**  And that can inform us as we sit down to structure the loans with the farmers.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:48):**  The experience that we are tapping into my two co-founders, Dave Haynes and Don Schaefer.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:53):**  Don was CEO of RSF Social Finance.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:29:55):**  So he has spent a decade there as CEO doing exactly this, integrated capital, creating  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:02):**  these innovative loan terms.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:04):**  So that's his background.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:05):**  Dave Haynes was private equity.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:07):**  He's been in the food space the same as I have for his entire career.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:11):**  And he has also brought incredible expertise in terms of what it looks like to actually  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:16):**  structure these financial packages for these different farmers in these different companies.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:21):**  So for us, it's sort of taking that collective expertise of an eco practices with RSF Social  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:26):**  Finance and bringing it together and saying we've actually got to think about the way  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:30):**  we finance farmers in a different, new and more innovative way.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:34):**  Yeah, I thought also something you mentioned.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:39):**  It's quite interesting because I think what we need in that whole discussion and I think  
**[0:30:46-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:46):**  the crisis that we're all currently facing through Corona is something that might add  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:53):**  some new potential to it.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:54):**  But we totally have to change the narrative.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:30:58):**  We are so caught up in emotional fights about who is right and who is wrong.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:31:05):**  And with that comes so much pain and lost energy because we're all just putting all  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:31:12):**  the energy in the discussion and not really thinking about solutions.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:31:16):**  But the thing is that we're fighting around the topic if convention is the right way or  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:31:22):**  ecological is the right way or this or that or whatever.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:31:26):**  And there is not one testable or one provable claim, so to say.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:31:33):**  Everyone has his own thoughts or her own thoughts and that's okay.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:31:37):**  But what I think many of us, if not all of us can agree on that farmers are left out  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:31:44):**  of the conversations or put it differently, farmers are at the moment just not earning  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:31:50):**  the incomes.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:31:52):**  Farmers are in the situation where they cannot be in.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:31:54):**  They're dependent.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:31:55):**  They have debt.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:31:56):**  They are in bad situations pretty much all over the world.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:31:59):**  We can more or less all agree on that.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:32:02):**  So that alone is a reason to say, hey, everyone who is involved from the farmer, him or herself,  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:32:11):**  throughout the whole value chain up to the politicians, we have to change the system.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:32:15):**  And now the solution or now the discussion should not be, is this the right way or that  
**[0:32:20-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:32:20):**  the right way?  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:32:21):**  Because that doesn't help.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:32:22):**  And there's many thousands of right ways always depending on your thoughts, your ethics, your  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:32:28):**  machinery, your market entry, whatever.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:32:30):**  But what we all agree on is we need to find a new way.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:32:35):**  And what's that new way going to look like?  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:32:37):**  And what does that incorporate?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:32:39):**  I think that whole idea of actually finding a new narrative, which is not emotionally  
**[0:32:44-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:32:44):**  so already fed up with, I guess, is really something that we can all maybe draw more  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:32:51):**  focus on and then from that start to actually start talking about solutions.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:32:56):**  Again, and I think it's 100 percent and in the conversations we've been having over the  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:01):**  last several weeks as this coronavirus hits the globe is, you know, here in the United  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:06):**  States is exposed incredible vulnerabilities in the food system.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:10):**  And one of the first being that most of our farm workers, unfortunately, have not been  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:14):**  granted legal status.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:15):**  So here they are providing one of the most fundamental, fundamental, critical services  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:21):**  to our country.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:22):**  And yet we haven't even granted them legal status.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:25):**  And some might come back and say, oh, well, those are jobs that could be reserved for  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:28):**  Americans.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:29):**  But, you know, study after study shows that when those jobs are posted, Americans aren't  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:32):**  they're not signing up to to bend over backwards in the fields, you know, picking strawberries  
**[0:33:37-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:37):**  all day long.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:38):**  So, again, it's really it's really saying, how do we actually how do we actually build  
**[0:33:44-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:44):**  a sustainable food system?  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:46):**  And that's that is from the farm level, farm worker level, all the way through the truckers,  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:52):**  through the cashiers, to the grocery store clerks, to the companies and the industries  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:56):**  that are that are helping feed the world.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:33:59):**  And so, again, it's I think we sort of we built out this system without without thinking  
**[0:34:04-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:04):**  through the long term consequences.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:06):**  And now even in the short term consequences, the impact and the externalized costs.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:11):**  And, you know, again, there were brilliant marketing models put forward and brilliant  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:16):**  PR campaigns put forward about how this agrochemical operating system was going to feed the world.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:22):**  According to the United Nations and according to the USDA, 40 percent of the food that we  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:25):**  produce is wasted and thrown away.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:27):**  So, again, you know, is it a production problem or is it actually a distribution problem?  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:32):**  And how do we actually solve for this?  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:34):**  And most importantly, how do we do it in a transparent way?  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:37):**  So how do we bring transparency to the absolute financial and economic devastation that our  
**[0:34:42-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:42):**  farmers are seeing so that people are aware of that?  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:44):**  And that's been a focus of mine for a really good part of my career.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:47):**  I'm actually named after a farmer in New Zealand.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:49):**  And so it's it's very personal.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:51):**  So how do we bring how do we bring a real awareness to the fact that we've created a  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:34:56):**  situation for farming in the United States and around the world that's made it so that  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:00):**  the next generation does not want to step into that as a career?  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:04):**  And that puts so much at risk.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:05):**  So how do we actually rethink the economic and financial situations of farming in America,  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:11):**  farming in Germany, farming in Europe, you know, wherever it might be farming in New  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:14):**  Zealand so that younger generations are looking at that as viable, lucrative careers that  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:20):**  they actually want to step into?  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:22):**  Because that doesn't exist right now.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:24):**  And that's the food crisis that's a couple of years out.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:29):**  Do you see like a growing interest?  
**[0:35:32-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:32):**  Because we see the same here in Europe.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:35):**  Suddenly people are exposed to empty shelves in the supermarket and you never had to think  
**[0:35:39-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:39):**  about that.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:40):**  And suddenly people are I just heard from a local food company in the Netherlands that  
**[0:35:46-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:46):**  basically overnight doubled their amount of customers in a week.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:49):**  Sorry, not overnight.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:50):**  Double their amount of customers and every one of those customers ordered 30 percent  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:53):**  more than they usually did, meaning that they even grew more in a week.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:35:57):**  And I hear that from many different places like the local food scene, unless you are  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:01):**  very exposed to restaurants, obviously, is booming.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:05):**  Do you see that on the farmer side of things as well?  
**[0:36:07-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:07):**  Is there or are we too early in that crisis to see a certain awakening moment?  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:13):**  I cannot be just a monoculture selling to one customer or one client or one wholesaler  
**[0:36:19-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:19):**  and that's it.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:21):**  I'm very fragile in that system.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:22):**  Or is it are we too early to see that?  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:24):**  And are we just maybe I wouldn't say hoping, but looking for these little lights in a very  
**[0:36:29-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:29):**  dark period?  
**[0:36:30-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:30):**  I think, you know, the invitation is going to be to creatively disrupt this current model.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:36):**  And, you know, one of the conversations we had yesterday was with the president of Driscoll's  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:40):**  and he was talking about how for anybody that doesn't know Driscoll's, what does Driscoll's  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:45):**  do?  
**[0:36:46-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:46):**  Driscoll's is raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, heavily based in California,  
**[0:36:53-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:53):**  but also globally, China, around the world.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:36:56):**  And what I love about him is he is from Denmark and he is a systems thinker.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:37:02):**  And so he, again, will go high level and kind of observe best practices that are happening  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:37:09):**  around the world.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:37:10):**  And one of the points he made on our call yesterday was that tomato growers in Florida  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:37:16):**  are being absolutely hammered by this disruption with this virus right now because predominantly  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:37:22):**  they sell into food services, whereas Driscoll's, the berry grower only has not only but 8 percent  
**[0:37:28-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:37:28):**  of their business is going into food service.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:37:30):**  So all of a sudden you've got tomato growers where the majority of their business was going  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:37:34):**  into food service, so cafeteria, school cafeterias, business cafeterias, and it is shut down.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:37:40):**  You know, and you can't suddenly like repopulate those fields quickly.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:37:43):**  You know, that tomato stuff is being donated to food banks, donated to shelters, and it's  
**[0:37:48-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:37:48):**  out.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:37:49):**  You know, so his point was, you know, you better anticipate the cost of things like  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:37:53):**  spaghetti sauce to start going through the roof because that was the tomato supply that  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:37:58):**  just basically had to be donated because that market that they had always sold into and  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:38:03):**  really relied on as a primary source of their revenue went away.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:38:09):**  So again, that one size fits all proved really detrimental.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:38:13):**  So again, how do we diversify?  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:38:15):**  How do we bring transparency to this?  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:38:18):**  What's interesting is that the food service companies themselves with the shutdown that's  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:38:21):**  happening of these, you know, massive cafeterias that they've been putting product into for  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:38:26):**  decades, they realized that they could start to sell stuff individually.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:38:30):**  So you know, they're doing food drops, you know, residential food drops.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:38:32):**  I mean, it's fascinating kind of what this crisis is creating in terms of opportunities  
**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:38:38):**  and innovations and new models going forward.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:38:41):**  I think probably the worst decision that could have possibly been made was that any of these  
**[0:38:47-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:38:47):**  companies existed without farmers on their board.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:38:50):**  So when we talk to any of these startups or any of the companies that come to us and,  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:38:56):**  you know, are interested in what we're doing or interested in trying to secure capital,  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:00):**  whether we're referring them to partners, you know, my first question is always, do  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:04):**  you have a farmer on your board?  
**[0:39:08-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:08):**  And unfortunately, most of them don't.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:09):**  They don't think that way.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:10):**  And so you've got these brilliant minds coming out of the tech world, coming out of Silicon  
**[0:39:15-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:15):**  Valley.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:16):**  And, you know, again, they truly, truly are sincerely trying to help.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:19):**  They're trying to create solutions that are really tackling some of these systemic issues  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:23):**  in the food system, whether it's water, soil health, you know, different ways that they  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:27):**  can leverage ag technology on the farm.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:30):**  But unless there's a farmer who is core on that team, you could be creating something  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:35):**  that's never going to be used or adopted on the farm.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:38):**  And then that's hundreds of millions of dollars that's been wasted that really we can't afford  
**[0:39:42-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:42):**  to waste at this time.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:43):**  So like you're saying, you know, again, it's we've sort of treated the farmer as this sort  
**[0:39:49-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:49):**  of servant slave labor, this lower part of society, simply focusing on yields, when really  
**[0:39:56-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:56):**  the value they're providing is so much greater.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:39:59):**  And I think, you know, we're starting to understand globally the power that soil has as a carbon  
**[0:40:04-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:40:04):**  sink and that soils fundamental job before growing food for any of us, before anything  
**[0:40:10-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:40:10):**  else, soil's job is to capture carbon and store it.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:40:13):**  And when we've destroyed soil the way we have through these agrochemical systems, it's unable  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:40:18):**  to do the job it actually was designed to do.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:40:21):**  So with farmers, what you're seeing is, you know, their yields are declining because they've  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:40:25):**  been pouring these chemicals and treating their crops for the last 20 or 30 years.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:40:30):**  So as they begin to focus on soil health, what they're finding is that yields begin  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:40:34):**  to improve because, you know, again, there's water conservation, there's soil organic matter.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:40:38):**  So to recognize that the farmers play this role so far beyond yields and so far beyond  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:40:44):**  these ingredient inputs that they're feeding into the food companies.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:40:49):**  And you know, one of the things I wish that we could do, which, you know, B Corp and B  
**[0:40:54-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:40:54):**  Lab, they're sort of moving this way and people are beginning to think this way, but you know,  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:00):**  soil needs to be on the balance sheet of every company, water needs to be on the balance  
**[0:41:05-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:05):**  sheet of every company, clean air needs to be on the balance sheet of every company because  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:09):**  those companies can't run.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:11):**  They don't exist without those three assets.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:14):**  And unfortunately, we haven't included those in these models for these companies, whether  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:19):**  it's in the food industry or other.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:20):**  So there's enormous opportunity, I think, for people to engage.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:23):**  I heard from somebody at Richard Branson's office, and they were interested in the food  
**[0:41:28-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:28):**  space, there wasn't a ton of interest there.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:32):**  And I said, you know, talk to me a little bit about the model.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:34):**  And he launched into this conversation about travel and transport and leisure, and that's  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:39):**  their focus.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:40):**  And that's why they're not focusing on food.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:42):**  And I sort of stopped him and I said, listen, Joe, you know, what if Richard Branson was  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:47):**  to launch Virgin Farms?  
**[0:41:50-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:50):**  And what if Virgin Farms were solar and wind powered?  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:52):**  So you have, you know, renewable energy as part of that definition of regenerative, which  
**[0:41:57-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:41:57):**  is how we see it at Replant, is that if you're going to have regenerative agriculture, it  
**[0:42:00-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:00):**  includes renewable energy.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:02):**  So let's say Virgin Farms has solar and wind on those farms.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:06):**  And then it's also growing regenerative organic crops that are part of its system, you know,  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:10):**  that are feeding into all of the transport, travel and leisure programs that they've got  
**[0:42:14-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:14):**  in place.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:15):**  Imagine the power that Virgin would have with those farms capturing carbon, providing all  
**[0:42:22-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:22):**  of this renewable energy.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:24):**  And again, it's how do we think about any of these systems, any of these industries  
**[0:42:28-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:28):**  and any of these corporations?  
**[0:42:29-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:29):**  How do we think about it more as a closed loop so that these costs are not being externalized?  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:35):**  And in order to close that loop, you've got to have farmers at the table.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:38):**  I totally agree.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:39):**  I mean, in so many ways, you know, we all have an opinion and wishes and hopes and good  
**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:46):**  ideas and whatnot about the way we should do farming and what we all want from farming.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:51):**  But the farmers are most of the time left out of the conversation.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:42:55):**  But I mean, the thing is, I mean, I spoke to this amazing guy, Christian, he founded  
**[0:43:02-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:43:02):**  the Regional-Wert AG in Freiburg, which is basically a new way of getting, basically  
**[0:43:11-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:43:11):**  getting a public group of interested, like, let's say, private people to invest into basically  
**[0:43:20-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:43:20):**  a structure that then enables farmers to do certain ecological farming, basically, a model  
**[0:43:26-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:43:26):**  that all of you are probably aware of.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:43:29):**  And he basically also started that whole idea of basically the value of farming and putting  
**[0:43:34-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:43:34):**  that into a much broader perspective.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:43:37):**  And he came from exactly how you basically pointed it out from the sort of the financial  
**[0:43:42-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:43:42):**  side of it.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:43:43):**  Like, let's put those kind of numbers into the balance sheet.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:43:47):**  You know, that's real accounting.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:43:49):**  This is sort of the accounting approach that we need.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:43:53):**  And pretty much, I would say, anyone involved in this and all the farmers, they are obviously  
**[0:43:59-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:43:59):**  all completely agree with it.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:01):**  They're like, okay, this is the way we should do it.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:03):**  And it makes so much sense.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:05):**  But the problem is, and this is basically my question for you, Robin, is like, we need  
**[0:44:10-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:10):**  politics and politicians to work with that, to be open to those new concepts to say, okay,  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:19):**  let's take this work upon us.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:21):**  Let's try to incorporate it into our policy approaches.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:24):**  Let's actually take this as a starting point and be this basically the new standard of  
**[0:44:30-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:30):**  doing things.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:31):**  And if they don't do it, we will never get that reach.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:33):**  We will never take those kind of development steps that we need in order to scale it or  
**[0:44:38-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:38):**  to bring it into a larger group.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:41):**  So politics plays such a huge, immense role.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:45):**  So what's your experience?  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:47):**  What's your thought on that?  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:48):**  How can we basically lighten up their spirits and their motivation to, you know, it's work.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:54):**  It's a new approach.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:55):**  You know, you've got to do things, you've got to think differently.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:44:59):**  And how can we facilitate it?  
**[0:45:01-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:01):**  How can we help, you know, bringing people, especially politicians to be open to that  
**[0:45:06-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:06):**  and to be willing to change?  
**[0:45:08-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:08):**  What are your experience?  
**[0:45:09-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:09):**  What are your thoughts?  
**[0:45:10-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:10):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:12):**  And I, for better or worse, do have a fair amount of policy experience.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:16):**  I first started around legislation for food allergies, just labeling, you know, it's really  
**[0:45:22-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:22):**  that was 15 years ago, born out of a desire to protect a child I had with food allergies.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:28):**  And I'm grateful for it because at the time I just went to my local congressman and said,  
**[0:45:32-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:32):**  look, here's the data.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:34):**  This is the statistic.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:35):**  This is how many children have food allergies.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:37):**  This is how it's impacting society.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:39):**  And it was just data.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:40):**  I was incredibly intimidated.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:42):**  I had this vision of some politician behind this giant mahogany desk and that it was going  
**[0:45:47-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:47):**  to be really intimidating and I was going to feel really stupid and not able to do what  
**[0:45:52-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:52):**  I was hoping I would be able to do because I had no idea what the process was like.  
**[0:45:57-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:57):**  But I knew I had to start.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:45:58):**  And what was fascinating is that the first level then when you're working with any kind  
**[0:46:02-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:02):**  of policy change or policymaker is really a bunch of 20 something, early 30 something  
**[0:46:08-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:08):**  year olds who are super passionate about these issues.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:11):**  So whatever your perception might be for the person behind the desk who may have been in  
**[0:46:16-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:16):**  Congress or in government for 30 years, that frontline is a bunch of really energetic young  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:22):**  people.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:23):**  And that was probably the first thing I learned was these are the first hands that these issues  
**[0:46:28-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:28):**  get into.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:29):**  And this issue, this particular issue is so relevant to them.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:34):**  So to not be intimidated by beginning the process because that guy behind the mahogany  
**[0:46:39-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:39):**  desk you may or may not ever see.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:41):**  The most interaction you're going to be having is with a lot of the staff, which is late  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:45):**  20s, early 30s and really dialed into a lot of these issues in the 21st century.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:50):**  And then beyond that food allergy legislation, I then did a lot of work over a lot of years  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:56):**  around labeling genetically engineered ingredients in the United States.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:46:59):**  I was a founding board member of Just Label It, which was an organization that Gary Hirschberg  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:47:04):**  of Stonyfield started to really bring labeling to genetically engineered foods.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:47:09):**  And what was fascinating is while we were trying to accomplish that at the national  
**[0:47:13-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:47:13):**  level, the states began to really push for that labeling at the state level.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:47:20):**  And that was the most important lesson that I learned on policy is you have got to start  
**[0:47:25-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:47:25):**  local.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:47:27):**  When you start local, people are empowered to participate.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:47:30):**  And what we're asking for is for participation because there is no progress without participation.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:47:37):**  So by working with your local legislators first, you actually can get somewhere pretty  
**[0:47:43-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:47:43):**  quickly and pretty fast.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:47:45):**  Our local congressman is now the governor of Colorado.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:47:48):**  When we first sat down together, he told me, he said, you know, I know when somebody has  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:47:52):**  sent a letter or sent an email that there are dozens of other constituents who feel  
**[0:47:57-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:47:57):**  the same way who just haven't taken the time to actually sit down and send that email or  
**[0:48:01-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:01):**  send that letter.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:02):**  And so, you know, again, like you really have got to focus on progress, not perfection.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:07):**  We haven't inherited a food system that has been broken for at least 50 years.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:11):**  We're not going to fix that overnight.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:13):**  But as we begin to work with our local legislators, you know, our state level legislators, we  
**[0:48:18-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:18):**  can really begin to create change.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:20):**  So what was fascinating was at the national level, we were advocating for the labeling  
**[0:48:24-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:24):**  of genetically engineered foods.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:26):**  The state initiatives began to take off.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:28):**  The funding that we were up against was enormous.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:32):**  So for example, in the state of Colorado, you know, the industry, the food industry,  
**[0:48:36-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:36):**  the agrochemical groups, they put in something like $20 million.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:39):**  I don't think the state of Colorado that was pro labeling that side raised even a million.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:45):**  So we were completely outspent.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:47):**  But what it created was an education campaign.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:49):**  And all of a sudden, the consumers that had no idea how food was grown or that this process  
**[0:48:54-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:54):**  had even been implemented and was executed on farm, all of a sudden, consumers were learning  
**[0:48:59-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:48:59):**  about genetically engineered crops, the portfolio of chemicals required to grow them, and they  
**[0:49:03-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:03):**  began to opt out.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:04):**  And so the market changed.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:06):**  So my answer is policy follows the money.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:09):**  So it's not a neither or, it's a both and.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:11):**  So on the one hand, yes, you know, for those people that get really excited and really  
**[0:49:16-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:16):**  want to get involved and active on the policy side of things, we really, really need you.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:21):**  That was not me.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:22):**  I had to really learn how to do that.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:24):**  And I really had to lean into it.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:26):**  And it's incredibly inspiring work.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:29):**  And it also, it feels very much like you're really at the heart of the fabric of kind  
**[0:49:35-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:35):**  of the constitution or whatever the regulations are that your country was built on.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:40):**  So it's an incredibly inspiring work, but it's a long game, and it's not going to change  
**[0:49:44-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:44):**  overnight.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:46):**  What you can change is the consumer patterns and the consumer buying behavior.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:49):**  And so one of the things that we heard under the Obama administration when we were working  
**[0:49:54-0:49:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:54):**  on GMO labeling was basically, you have to give me political cover.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:49:59):**  So has the movement grown enough to create the political cover that the politicians need?  
**[0:50:04-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:50:04):**  So again, it's not either or, but it's both and.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:50:07):**  And again, I think where we are now is 80% of consumers are buying something organic  
**[0:50:11-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:50:11):**  and 75% of grocery store categories are now carrying something organic.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:50:16):**  So clearly, there's an awareness, the education has worked, people are shifting into free  
**[0:50:22-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:50:22):**  from food purchases.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:50:25):**  And as that happens, the policy continues to play out.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:50:30):**  So to me, we've got to be running both those things at the same time.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:50:35):**  What would be your advice?  
**[0:50:36-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:50:36):**  Because it sounds, I mean, the policy part definitely follows and at some point is in  
**[0:50:42-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:50:42):**  front and it really depends on the pieces, depends on the regions.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:50:44):**  We have a region here in actually up in the Alps in Italy that have banned all glyphosate  
**[0:50:51-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:50:51):**  and all chemical, basically chemical inputs because they found a lot of the residues in  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:50:56):**  children, diapers, etc. in way beyond the fields.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:00):**  Because of course, the farmers promised that it would only stay in the fields and would  
**[0:51:03-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:03):**  never go beyond the apple orchards they were spraying.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:06):**  And they found that and they actually did a referendum, it was a huge local movement,  
**[0:51:09-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:09):**  did a referendum, gave them a number of years to either move or transition to organic.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:14):**  And that has been spreading.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:15):**  So it's either moving really fast because a number of farmers are moving or it's moving  
**[0:51:19-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:19):**  fast because of concerned consumers, etc.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:22):**  But I want to be conscious of your time as well to finalize with a few questions.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:27):**  What would be your advice to, because we don't have a replanting Europe or at least not that  
**[0:51:31-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:31):**  we know of or in Germany, what would be your advice to a farmer like Benedict that is considering  
**[0:51:38-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:38):**  taking maybe on outside capital, but maybe also not?  
**[0:51:42-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:42):**  How to approach investors?  
**[0:51:44-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:44):**  And actually also that's a question, who are your current investors that are investing  
**[0:51:48-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:48):**  in these farmers or indirectly investing in these farmers?  
**[0:51:50-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:50):**  Is there something we can learn as Benedict is?  
**[0:51:53-0:51:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:53):**  And we are talking to financial groups and investors here in Europe that are interested  
**[0:51:58-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:51:58):**  in transition finance, but don't really know where to start.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:02):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:03):**  So, you know, I think there's an enormous opportunity to educate and farmers are some  
**[0:52:09-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:09):**  of the most incredible ambassadors for that.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:11):**  Some of the farmers and ranchers that we work with at Replant are incredible when they get  
**[0:52:16-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:16):**  in front of an audience and can explain and articulate this.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:20):**  And the power that soil has as a carbon sink and what that actually means to their yields  
**[0:52:24-0:52:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:24):**  because it's coming from such a true place.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:27):**  So again, you know, to really elevate the status and the authority of a farmer in our  
**[0:52:32-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:32):**  food system is critical.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:34):**  So if those opportunities exist, if you're invited to speak on a podcast, if you're invited  
**[0:52:39-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:39):**  to speak at a conference, if you are a farmer, say yes.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:43):**  And trust that you know more than most people on the subject matter and you're not going  
**[0:52:48-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:48):**  to screw up the lines because it's the life you've led.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:51):**  You're telling your own story.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:52):**  So you're not going to screw up the lines.  
**[0:52:54-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:52:54):**  So don't be intimidated by stepping into that leadership role and that voice of authority  
**[0:53:00-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:00):**  on these issues, because we really need farmers to step forward.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:04):**  In terms of capital, I think, you know, again, it's being really clear on who you are and  
**[0:53:10-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:10):**  what you need so that those capital partners can find you.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:14):**  And I think this the story of soil is a powerful carbon sink.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:18):**  That's a climate story.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:19):**  And once investors realize that that's a way for them to allocate resources for clients  
**[0:53:25-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:25):**  that are really focused on climate, you suddenly have a new opportunity.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:31):**  But again, you know, I understand that unfortunately, the resources in the capital markets are not  
**[0:53:37-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:37):**  there yet.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:38):**  They are growing quickly.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:40):**  Rabobank is a group in Europe that is one of the most forward thinking.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:44):**  And I've had the privilege and joy, really, it was a lot of fun to work with them on some  
**[0:53:48-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:48):**  different initiatives here in the United States.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:50):**  So as an institution in Europe, they are one of the most forward thinking.  
**[0:53:56-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:53:56):**  And then again, it's really, I think, to really kind of build coalitions.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:54:01):**  So again, for Benedict and others to really find other like minded farmers and think about  
**[0:54:08-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:54:08):**  how you guys can come together, because it's far less intimidating when you're going out  
**[0:54:14-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:54:14):**  on these new initiatives, if you're doing it as a team.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:54:16):**  Yeah, I totally agree.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:54:18):**  I think that's really a crucial point.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:54:20):**  I would have asked this early on, actually, because you mentioned a couple of times also  
**[0:54:25-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:54:25):**  the connection between farmers and then potential, you know, large, large wholesalers, for examples.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:54:32):**  And that's always the question of critical mass, right?  
**[0:54:34-0:54:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:54:34):**  Because I think, as of now, as lead in Germany, if you approach this new way, if you speak  
**[0:54:40-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:54:40):**  to any potential buyer of your product, they'll be like, yeah, I mean, sounds cool.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:54:47):**  Like let me know when you've got it, and then we'll talk basically, right?  
**[0:54:51-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:54:51):**  So to have that upfront, basically, security of saying, hey, if you can provide me with  
**[0:54:57-0:55:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:54:57):**  product XYZ at this and that quality, I will buy it for this and that price, you can't  
**[0:55:02-0:55:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:02):**  get that as of now.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:04):**  So I think finding other farmers around your area, finding other farmers who basically  
**[0:55:09-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:09):**  approach the same, let's say, I guess, journey that you are, I think that's really critical,  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:16):**  because you can not only speak about the experience and the mistakes that you're probably going  
**[0:55:21-0:55:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:21):**  to do plenty of, but you can also talk about, look, we've got certain products, we've got  
**[0:55:26-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:26):**  certain things that we can offer as a group in a way, right?  
**[0:55:30-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:30):**  And that makes the attractiveness of it to a large buyer much, much higher as well, right?  
**[0:55:35-0:55:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:35):**  So I think that's such an important part of it.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:38):**  Yeah, I totally agree.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:39):**  And I mean, again, I think, you know, we're building a system that hasn't existed before.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:44):**  So give yourself permission for the grace and flexibility that's required in that and  
**[0:55:48-0:55:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:48):**  that we are going to fall down, we are going to trip and fall.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:51):**  The important thing is you get up and you keep going.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:53):**  And I think it's also why, you know, to have colleagues beside you, as we work through  
**[0:55:58-0:56:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:55:58):**  this, just psychologically, it's really important because then you know, you're not going it  
**[0:56:03-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:03):**  alone, that you've got somebody beside you kind of looking out for you, as we all navigate  
**[0:56:08-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:08):**  this.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:09):**  I think with that, I have the feeling, but I usually have this when we do a podcast,  
**[0:56:14-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:14):**  we really scratch the surface, there's so much more to dive into to unpack, as we're  
**[0:56:18-0:56:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:18):**  building this sector and this space.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:21):**  I want to thank you, Robin, so much for your time, and for sharing your lessons learned  
**[0:56:26-0:56:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:26):**  so far.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:27):**  And obviously, you'll be learning a lot more over the next months and years.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:31):**  And thank you guys so much for this conversation.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:35):**  It's clearly just so critical.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:37):**  And I think for anyone listening, the takeaway is, if you don't know your farmers, get to  
**[0:56:43-0:56:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:43):**  know them.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:44):**  And it doesn't matter what industry you're in, because your employees are completely  
**[0:56:47-0:56:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:47):**  dependent on food.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:49):**  So the more that we can elevate farmer status in our society, politically, you know, in  
**[0:56:53-0:56:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:53):**  the United States, I think we only have something like two farmers that are members of Congress.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:56:58):**  And again, for such a critically important part of society, there needs to be more representation  
**[0:57:04-0:57:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:57:04):**  at the table at every table.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:57:06):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:57:07):**  That was the, you started this podcast so nicely with such beautiful words, and you  
**[0:57:11-0:57:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:57:11):**  ended it with the best way you could possibly do.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:57:13):**  So thank you so much.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:57:14):**  It was such a pleasure having the chance to talk to you.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:57:17):**  And thank you for your time.

**[0:57:22-0:57:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:57:22):**  Thanks so much, you guys.

**[0:58:07-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:58:07):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:58:11-0:58:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:58:11):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:58:15):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:58:17-0:58:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:58:17):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:58:21-0:58:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:58:21):**  to work in regenerating soils, and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:58:26-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:58:26):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:58:30):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:58:33-0:58:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:58:33):**  How have we built our decision making framework, what to focus on with the podcast, how have  
**[0:58:38-0:58:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:58:38):**  we picked interviewees, what questions should you ask, what is happening in the space, what  
**[0:58:43-0:58:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:58:43):**  should you read, what should you listen, what should you watch, how to approach this space.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:58:49):**  For whom is this course?  
**[0:58:51-0:58:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:58:51):**  You, the soil builders and investors in the space.

**[0:59:03-0:59:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:59:03):**  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management, consultants, etc.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:59:08):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:59:11):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:59:14-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:59:14):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:59:24-0:59:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:59:24):**  No.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:59:25):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:59:27):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:59:31):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:59:36-0:59:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:59:36):**  different means.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:59:37):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  
**[0:59:42-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:59:42):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:59:45):**  Thank you.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:59:46):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:59:47-0:59:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/28/transition-finance-ep4/#t=0:59:47):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides

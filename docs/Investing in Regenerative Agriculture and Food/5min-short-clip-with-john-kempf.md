### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 23 Jul 2019 13:00:34)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:00):**  You're going to listen to a short clip from the full interview I did with John Kempf,  
**[0:00:05-0:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:05):**  co-founder of Advancing Eco-Agriculture, where John explains why you should forget about  
**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:09):**  soil health and focus on plant health instead.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:13):**  You asked this question to Gabe Brown actually in an earlier interview.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:16):**  What do you believe, I'm going to use this question because I think it's very strong,  
**[0:00:19-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:19):**  what do you believe that is true?  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:21):**  And you said about modern agriculture that others don't believe, but I would like to  
**[0:00:25-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:25):**  ask this one.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:26):**  What do you believe that is true about regenerative agriculture that others don't believe to be  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:29):**  true?  
**[0:00:32-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:32):**  What I believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that is different from what many  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:39):**  other people think about is what the engine of change actually is.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:44):**  There is this idea within, particularly within the domain of organic and biological and regenerative  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:50):**  agriculture that it takes healthy soil to grow healthy plants.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:55):**  If you want to produce a disease and insect resistant crop, as I've been talking about,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:00:58):**  then you need to begin by focusing on soil health.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:01):**  I believe this is in fact completely inaccurate.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:08):**  It is not healthy soil that produces healthy plants.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:11):**  It is healthy plants which create healthy soil.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:14):**  If you consider soil in the absence of plants, then it is essentially decomposed rock.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:21):**  But it is in fact plants which through the process of photosynthesis, carbon sequestration,  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:26):**  producing sugars, transmit these sugars out through the roots as root exudates to feed  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:30):**  soil biology that contribute organic matter and that create what we consider to be healthy  
**[0:01:35-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:35):**  soil.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:37):**  The foundational idea behind this is the realization that what we have come to accept as normal  
**[0:01:43-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:43):**  and as common is plants which are photosynthesizing only about 15 to 20 percent of their inherent  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:50):**  photosynthetic and genetic capacity.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:01:52):**  That it is possible to manage nutrition by using foliar applications of specific nutrients  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:00):**  and by using biologicals to in effect hack the system where we can increase the photosynthesis  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:06):**  of a given plant or given crop from let's say 20 percent up to 80 percent, which means  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:11):**  that we quadruple the volume of sugars being produced in every 24-hour photo period.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:16):**  But that quadrupling of sugars isn't necessarily going to contribute to quadrupling the yield.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:22):**  You might get a 20 percent or a 40 percent yield response, but you won't likely get a  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:27):**  4x yield response.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:29):**  So all of the additional sugars that are produced from this spike in photosynthesis are sent  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:34):**  out through the root systems as root exudates to feed soil biology.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:39):**  This is how we can build soil organic matter by a third to a half a percentage point per  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:44):**  year while we are growing a crop.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:47):**  We can do this on strawberries in California where we have the soil is tilled with a rototiller  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:52):**  every year.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:53):**  It's covered in plastic mulch.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:55):**  It's fumigated.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:56):**  There are no cover crops.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:02:57):**  There is a long list of sins committed against soil health and strawberry production and  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:02):**  some of these fruit and vegetable ecosystems.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:05):**  And yet we can build soil organic matter in these systems and sequester carbon simply  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:11):**  by focusing on plant health.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:13):**  So our emphasis, our focus should not be on building soil health, but instead on increasing  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:22):**  plant health because healthy plants are the engine that create healthy soil.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:28):**  And I mean, this is going to go against quite a few people in the regenerative agriculture  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:33):**  space, including me.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:34):**  It always says focus on the soil, focus on the soil.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:36):**  But it's you're right.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:38):**  The plants and the trees create the soil.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:40):**  What does it mean for soil less growing in greenhouses, hydroponics, etc.?  
**[0:03:47-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:47):**  Well, the challenge with growing in hydroponics is that in most cases, in many cases at least,  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:03:56):**  the biology that is needed to support plant health is absent in the root system.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:02):**  So I put together a diagram called the Plant Health Pyramid that we use to describe for  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:07):**  growers how we observe the evolution of plant health at different stages, different physiological  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:13):**  processes, how they become resistant to different types and groups of diseases and insects.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:19):**  And what we've observed is that the first two levels of the Plant Health Pyramid, level  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:23):**  one and level two, where there's complete photosynthesis and complete protein synthesis,  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:27):**  these first two levels can be achieved simply by balancing plant chemistry and by balancing  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:34):**  plant nutrition.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:35):**  So those first two levels can be achieved hydroponically.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:39):**  The upper two levels of the Plant Health Pyramid, where plants begin producing much higher concentrations  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:46):**  and much higher levels of plant secondary metabolites and all these aromatic compounds  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:52):**  that form the foundation of us being able to have a conversation about food as medicine,  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:04:58):**  these compounds are only formed in higher levels when plants have an abundant microbial  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:04):**  community in the root system and in the rhizosphere, which precludes most hydroponic operations.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:11):**  So if we really want to have a conversation about producing healthy food, plants that  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:17):**  are resistant to all diseases and all insects and achieving the upper levels of the Plant  
**[0:05:21-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/29/john-kempf/#t=0:05:21):**  Health Pyramid, that is generally quite unlikely to happen in a hydroponic system.

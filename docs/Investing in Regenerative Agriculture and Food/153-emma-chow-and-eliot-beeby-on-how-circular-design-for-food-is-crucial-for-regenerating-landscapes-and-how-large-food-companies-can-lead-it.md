### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 22 Feb 2022 17:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:14):**  Most products we buy in supermarkets come from a few, very few large food companies,  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:19):**  also known as FMCGs, fast moving consumer good companies.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:23):**  They have made very big commitments about climate change, about biodiversity, not all,  
**[0:00:27-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:27):**  but they should.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:28):**  But is that enough?  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:29):**  Today we dive deep into why they need to fundamentally change the design of their products.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:33):**  And I'm not talking about packaging, which they also have to change, but about the ingredients  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:37):**  and how to buy the ingredients what our landscape can produce regeneratively and how to turn  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:42):**  that into appealing and tasty products.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:45):**  Simply sourcing responsibly isn't enough and the results can be actually quite astonishing  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:50):**  on emissions, calories produced, biodiversity and farmers' profit.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:53):**  So join me in an episode about the big food redesign with an organization that works with  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:00:57):**  most of the large food companies, which mind you, touch about 40% of the farmland in the  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:01:03):**  UK and Europe with their products and their sourcing.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:01:09):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:01:13):**  the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:01:17):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:01:22-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:01:22):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:01:29):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:01:31):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:35-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:01:35):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:01:37):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:01:42):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:01:46):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:01:50):**  our work.

**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:11):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:13):**  Welcome to another episode today with the team of the Ellen MacArthur Food Initiative.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:17):**  We recently published a report, the Big Food Redesign.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:20):**  Rather than bending nature to produce food, food can be designed for nature to thrive.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:24):**  I see a lot of things we should unpack there.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:26):**  So welcome Emma and Elliot.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:28):**  Thanks for having us.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:29):**  Thank you so much for having us.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:31):**  And to start with a personal question to both of you, you can decide who steps in first.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:36):**  How did you end up working on the big redesign for food?  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:39):**  Because that's quite a specific, it's very needed, but it's very specific within a niche.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:43):**  Yes, maybe I'll start.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:46):**  For me, the origins were way back when I was, I think I was 18 and I read Bill McKibben's  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:53):**  book, The End of Nature.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:02:55):**  And that lit this fire in front of me that gave the sense of urgency that I'd never felt  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:00):**  before, particularly around climate change and needing to be part of the solution.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:06):**  So it was then that I thought I would dive into economics and environmental studies when  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:11):**  I pursued my degree.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:15):**  And I didn't dive deeply into food though, at that point.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:18):**  It was years later when I was done my studies and I was volunteering on organic farms through  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:24):**  Europe.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:25):**  That was so many aha moments, but I realized growing up in the city of Toronto in Canada,  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:32):**  I really hadn't spent time on farms.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:34):**  And I was like so many urban citizens these days, detached from the food I was eating,  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:41):**  the stories behind it, the impact it had, the people that grew it, what soil even meant,  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:47):**  right?  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:48):**  What does healthy soil even look like?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:49):**  I knew nothing.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:51):**  And I felt like a total beginner, a child learning in this space.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:55):**  And I'm still very much a beginner when it comes to farming.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:03:59):**  But it was that moment that my whole relationship at a personal level was rewritten with food.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:04:05):**  And this food had such amazing flavor.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:04:08):**  And suddenly I liked all these vegetables that I thought I hated growing up.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:04:12):**  And I had this question, like, how have I never been exposed to food like this in my  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:04:17):**  life?  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:04:18):**  First question.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:04:19):**  And second, why are we not in a world where this is the norm, not the anomaly?  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:04:25):**  And what's it going to take to get there?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:04:27):**  Because it's not realistic to expect that everyone is going to, in our capitalist society,  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:04:33):**  be ditching their jobs tomorrow and doing organic farming and living the stories that  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:04:39):**  so many of the hosts I was with were embodying.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:04:43):**  And so this question around how do we get this at scale sat with me for some more years  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:04:48):**  and ultimately led me to this amazing opportunity to work at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:04:54):**  on food, just when we were starting to explore what contributions circular economy could  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:00):**  make to positive food system transformation.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:04):**  And we've now been working on this for about four years on food.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:09):**  And this latest publication, the Big Food Redesign, which we can unpack a lot more,  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:14):**  is about how we can get that scale with major food buyers, like the food brands that we  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:20):**  see every day on grocery store shelves and the retailers that we get so many of our groceries  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:25):**  from.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:26):**  So that's a short form version of my long journey to getting to where I am today and  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:32):**  speaking to you about this.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:34):**  One follow up question before we go to Elliot.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:36):**  I mean, you finished university and you decided to go roofing on organic farms in Europe.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:42):**  That's quite a leap.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:43):**  I mean, for somebody who didn't grow up on farming and had an interest in food, but not  
**[0:05:46-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:46):**  maybe not the huge interest.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:47):**  You said there were a lot of aha moments when you did that.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:50):**  Why did you decided to go and volunteer on organic farms in Europe?  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:05:54):**  I had a roommate my first year at university who had taken a gap year and she told me all  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:00):**  these ridiculous stories that I thought, wow, she's so much more adventurous than I'd ever  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:04):**  be.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:05):**  And then I found myself four years later with a six month gap before I was starting my job.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:13):**  And so I thought, what am I going to do with this?  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:16):**  And I didn't have a lot of money and there's all sorts of work exchange platforms out there.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:21):**  And Woofing is one of those.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:23):**  And I thought, this could be cool.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:25):**  I can be in nature.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:26):**  I can learn something new, get a cultural experience.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:30):**  I had no idea what I was really signing up for.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:33):**  And yet it changed your life.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:35):**  Yeah, no, fascinating.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:37):**  And what about you Elliot?  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:38):**  How did you end up working on the Big Food redesign?  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:41):**  So I studied climate change at university.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:44):**  And as I was studying that, I kind of realized that the food system was both like such a  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:49):**  major driver of many of the problems that we face in the world today, but also could  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:53):**  potentially be a big part of the solution as well.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:06:56):**  And I came across this term regenerative agriculture some way through my studies and got reading  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:01):**  on about it.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:02):**  And it just really struck me as something that would potentially solve so many of the  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:06):**  problems that the food system faces like climate change, which is what I've been studying,  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:11):**  as well as the biodiversity crisis, and then improving socioeconomics of rural communities  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:16):**  as well.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:17):**  And I felt like if it was done right, it could be an amazing solution to some of the problems  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:22):**  we face.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:24):**  I guess what I wanted to contribute to the space was to really ensure that it didn't  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:30):**  just become a greenwashing term, which is something that I kind of feared if it fell  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:35):**  into the wrong hands or if it was approached from a very shallow perspective.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:40):**  I really don't think it should be or that it is, but I wanted to contribute to make  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:45):**  sure that there was an evidence based agenda around regenerative agriculture to make sure  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:51):**  that outcomes are measured.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:53):**  And just to try and help organizations working in that space to develop a bit more of a deeper  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:07:57):**  understanding of what regeneration can be.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:00):**  So let's start unpack the circular design for food, because I think many know the Ellen  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:04):**  MacArthur Foundation from the food work, but also from the circular economy work, from  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:08):**  the broader work, and of course, sailing around the ocean by herself.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:11):**  But what I mean, you join Emma when the food focus started and you said it's been like  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:16):**  a four year journey now, leading to a number of reports, a number of work pieces and at  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:20):**  the end now to this big one on a redesign of food, which is quite, quite deep.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:25):**  It goes quite deep.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:26):**  So what is circular design for food to both of you?  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:29):**  I mean, obviously who wants to take this one?  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:30):**  I'll start with the basics and then Elliot can build.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:33):**  I'll start, especially for listeners who may have never heard of circular economy, which  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:38):**  is perfectly normal and fine if you never have.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:41):**  But it's based on three principles of eliminating waste and pollution, circulating nutrients  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:46):**  and products at their highest value and regenerating nature.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:50):**  And so we can take these principles and we can apply them throughout all aspects of our  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:08:55):**  economy to move from today's what we call linear take make waste system to one that  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:00):**  is restorative and regenerative by design.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:04):**  So that's the starting point.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:05):**  And you heard at the end there by design, which is just so central.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:10):**  I feel that design piece is going to be fundamental.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:12):**  Right.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:13):**  We're talking about redesigning business models, services, products.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:18):**  And here we're talking about redesigning food.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:21):**  So we can move towards a future where our food is contributing to that nature positive  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:29):**  outcome and through its very productive production, actually helping to regenerate nature rather  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:35):**  than today, which is at large, hugely degenerative.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:40):**  And it all starts with design.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:41):**  We can't just try and incrementally improve the sourcing of current ingredients.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:46):**  We actually need to rethink what foods are being offered on the market.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:51):**  And this is where we see that a big part of that unlock sits with a relatively small group  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:09:57):**  of major food manufacturers, what we call FMCGs and retailers.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:10:02):**  And we found that about 40% of the agricultural land in the EU and UK are supplying ingredients  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:10:09):**  to the top 10 FMCGs and retailers.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:10:13):**  FMCGs is for anybody not in the sector, fast moving consumer goods, I think, right?  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:10:18):**  The stuff we buy in the supermarket.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:10:20):**  Often called CPGs in North America.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:10:22):**  So we all know these brands.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:10:24):**  And just like our clothes or the device that you're listening to this on today, we don't  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:10:30):**  think about it so much, but our food is designed just like a pair of jeans are.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:10:36):**  And what I mean by that is one or often several people have made decisions on your behalf  
**[0:10:42-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:10:42):**  that determine the flavor, the texture, the nutrition, the price and the impact of the  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:10:49):**  foods that you eat, whether it's the pasta you're going to make for your family this  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:10:53):**  evening or the cereal that you ate for breakfast today.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:10:57):**  Those design decisions have been made for you.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:00):**  And we're not today fully realizing the potential of that food design process to maximize the  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:07):**  positive impacts that the food can have for your own body and nutrition and wellbeing,  
**[0:11:12-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:12):**  but also for the farmers who produce those ingredients for the soil and the nature that  
**[0:11:19-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:19):**  gave way to those ingredients as well.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:20):**  And so that's what this whole piece of work was all about.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:24):**  And I'll stop there because I'm sure there's more questions.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:28):**  So what you're saying is the current design of the things we find in the supermarket shelves  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:32):**  and we're not talking about, but even potentially the fresh stuff, but mostly the processed  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:36):**  things is not made for regional agriculture producers or practices.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:41):**  It's made for a different system.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:42):**  And if we want to change the agriculture system, we have to change the design recipes.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:47):**  So we're not talking about the design of the packaging.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:49):**  We're talking about design of the products in it, just like you're talking design of  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:53):**  the headphones, I happen to wear one that you can actually fix.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:11:55):**  Yeah, phones that you can actually fix like the same principles you apply to products.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:00):**  We can also, and have to apply to food because otherwise we just be making very, very small  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:05):**  marginal changes and we're not going to get the results we're looking for.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:08):**  Exactly.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:09):**  So what does it mean?  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:10):**  Like how does that concrete?  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:11):**  You have a number of examples in the report.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:12):**  I will link it below, obviously for everybody to read it.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:15):**  It's very visual, relatively short, and it's amazing to read.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:18):**  It's one of the best ones or one of the nicest and interesting ones I've seen last year,  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:22):**  but let's bring it to life.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:23):**  What are some examples where we see that the current design is limited and design changes  
**[0:12:28-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:28):**  could unlock a lot of potential benefits?  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:31):**  Yeah, we worked with a design agency in North America called Alpha Food Labs, who are specialists  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:37):**  in design and innovation.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:40):**  And we wanted to work with them to create some speculative food products of the future  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:43):**  to try and illustrate what some of these products could actually look like in future.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:47):**  What it would look like if companies redesign their product portfolios in line with circular  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:52):**  economy principles and then how that would affect agricultural landscapes.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:12:57):**  Because as Emma was saying, the decisions that are made upstream in offices and research  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:13:02):**  and development labs and places, they ultimately influence what farmers grow, how they grow  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:13:08):**  it and that ultimately influences what agricultural landscapes look like.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:13:13):**  So one of the examples, my favorite example from the report actually is called Silvo.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:13:19):**  So Silvo is a line of cheeses which is made from all the outputs of the Silvo pasture  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:13:23):**  system.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:13:24):**  So many of your listeners may know already, but Silvo pasture is when you're grazing animals  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:13:28):**  in the field, which also has lots of trees in it.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:13:31):**  And those trees are also used to produce, they could be used to produce food for humans.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:13:36):**  They could be used to produce feed for animals or timber or oils or other useful products.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:13:43):**  So the line of cheeses Silvo is made from walnuts and then from dairy milk.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:13:49):**  And yeah, in the case of Silvo's farms, the cattle that are grazed amongst the walnut  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:13:54):**  trees are also managed using a system called managed intensive grazing.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:13:59):**  So this is when you have cattle in a sort of bigger agricultural land that are fenced  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:03):**  into a much smaller portion of that agricultural land.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:07):**  And each day they're moved to a different section of that agricultural land.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:11):**  It's kind of like herds of water beast in Africa or bison in North America because they're  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:17):**  constantly moving.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:18):**  They're not degrading the land in the same way as if they were staying in that same place  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:23):**  all the time.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:24):**  And the nutrients that they produce in their urine and in their dung helps to fertilize  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:29):**  that land and build the soil health as well.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:33):**  So when you do silvopasture and when you manage the cattle in that silvopasture system using  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:39):**  managed intensive grazing, under the right conditions, that farm system overall could  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:43):**  actually be sequestering more carbon than all the greenhouse gas emissions produced  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:48):**  by the cows living in that system, which is amazing, like such incredible regenerative  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:53):**  outcomes.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:54):**  And this is a really nice example of how if you're designing food products with the intention  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:14:59):**  of them having regenerative outcomes from the start, then you can really achieve these  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:03):**  quite impressive outcomes at the end.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:06):**  And just one final thing to say on silvo.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:10):**  There's quite an important design decision made by the imagined product concept.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:15):**  Because just to be clear, this is not for sale yet.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:17):**  Yeah, unfortunately, this is not on the shelves.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:20):**  If everybody starts googling now, or DuckDuckGo or Ecosia, it doesn't exist yet.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:24):**  We wish.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:25):**  So sorry, an important design decision made.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:27):**  No, no, I definitely should have mentioned that.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:30):**  You're right.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:31):**  But one important feature is that, so this line of cheeses is made from the cow's milk,  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:35):**  it's made from the walnuts milk.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:37):**  So you have a vegan walnut milk cheese, you have a normal dairy cheese made from the drenth  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:43):**  of cow's milk, you have a blended cheese made from the walnuts and the cow's milk together.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:48):**  Rather than selling those individually, to help match the demand of what the agro ecosystem  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:53):**  can actually produce, the cheeses are sold in a tasting pack.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:15:57):**  So you can't just buy the vegan cheese if that's what you want.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:01):**  So in that way, you're sort of matching the demand with what the agro system can actually  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:05):**  provide.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:06):**  And it's those types of seemingly small decisions that can actually help to, yeah, help those  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:12):**  adjustments in the buying models can actually be pretty powerful for farmers.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:16):**  So almost like we have the nose to tail or using the full vegetable.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:20):**  I mean, there's a lot of discussion on that, but in this case, you're saying use the full  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:23):**  landscape, harvest the full landscape, make those products and don't allow somebody to  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:28):**  buy one thing out of it and then hope that it will lead to a huge change, but actually  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:33):**  force through design because it's forcing you, you don't have to choose that you can  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:36):**  buy another brand, but force through design these landscape outcomes almost.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:40):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:41):**  That most of the tail analogy that you just made is actually a really nice one.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:45):**  You're matching the using everything that the landscape provides and designing products  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:49):**  around that rather than just saying we want cow's milk and it doesn't matter what else  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:54):**  the landscape is producing.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:56):**  How different is that from the current situation?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:16:58):**  I mean, let's say, of course, we can imagine many other of these products and then going  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:03):**  to your partners and the people you're working with in these large, because you mentioned  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:07):**  40% of the agricultural land in Europe and the UK is influenced directly by a very small  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:12):**  amount of, I mean, large companies, but very small amount of companies.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:16):**  When you bring this to them and say, look, there's a huge difference from sourcing one  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:20):**  ingredient and hoping for a better outcome of these grain practices because you're making  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:23):**  pasta.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:24):**  It's a very big shift to saying this is what a landscape could produce.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:28):**  How is, is or was the reaction, because it's quite a significant shift, not different than  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:33):**  the circular economy shift in physical products or like you've been doing that for years.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:38):**  How has been the response or has been the reception, let's say, from this huge food  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:42):**  redesign, because this is a fundamental, like you force companies or you ask companies to,  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:46):**  to change their recipes, to change their products, literally not just to change packaging a bit  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:50):**  and put a nice green logo on it.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:52):**  So yes, it does entail a big shift, right?  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:17:55):**  And that can be much harder to rethink, renovate old products or innovate new ones in a fundamentally  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:18:01):**  different way from how things have been done before.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:18:05):**  And at the same time, I would say the response has been incredibly positive and hugely, you  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:18:11):**  know, spilling over with inspiration because this is a new way of doing things.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:18:16):**  And there's so much potential because of the influence they have.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:18:19):**  They can use their demand fairly quickly if we do things right to influence these positive  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:18:24):**  outcomes that are much better for biodiversity, for climate, for farmers and their incomes  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:18:30):**  and for total food output because you're doing, making the most of the land that we're using.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:18:34):**  So that's supporting these businesses goals on multiple levels.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:18:38):**  One is we're seeing a wave of many companies now setting and stone commitments and roadmaps  
**[0:18:44-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:18:44):**  for climate and increasingly biodiversity as well.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:18:47):**  So those are, you know, CEO endorsed commitments that they need to deliver on and we're giving  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:18:52):**  them a how and a pathway.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:18:54):**  So that's one thing.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:18:56):**  And two is the increasing resilience piece and de-risking supply chains, which again  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:01):**  is hitting companies' bottom lines, especially as extreme weather instances are becoming  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:07):**  more frequent.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:09):**  So again, it's not just a sustainability piece.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:11):**  It's actually coming to the core business and we quantified and we looked at different  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:16):**  scenarios by imagining these different products for wheat, dairy, potatoes in the EU and the  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:23):**  UK.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:24):**  And we found that across the board, it's consistent.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:26):**  You are getting much better outcomes when you take this design approach rather than  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:31):**  just saying, okay, I have been using this type of wheat today.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:34):**  I'm going to try and source it better.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:37):**  I can still get you some good outcomes.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:39):**  That's not a bad thing.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:40):**  It's well intended and it's part of the journey, but that's not going to get us to the end  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:44):**  state, which is fundamentally at that landscape level, which is why we need to work collectively  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:49):**  because it's no single company or actor in the system who can change it alone.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:19:55):**  And the policy piece needs to be there to help set those enabling conditions as well.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:01):**  So if we get government and we get industry working together, we can be bringing these  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:05):**  much better products and food offerings more broadly that consumers want, that are tasty,  
**[0:20:11-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:11):**  that are nutritious and make this nature positive future the norm and bring it as soon as possible,  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:18):**  which is what we need.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:19):**  What I really like about the report is you quantified this, you modeled it.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:23):**  Could you speak a bit about that?  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:24):**  Because you looked at reduction of biodiversity loss, the obviously emissions and total food  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:28):**  output.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:29):**  That's something like, oh, can we feed the world?  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:30):**  It always gets thrown at the food sector.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:33):**  And of course, farmer profitability, like how big is the difference if you have the  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:37):**  numbers on top of your head?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:38):**  Otherwise I would push everybody to read the report.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:40):**  But how big are the differences between better sourcing only and actually doing this full  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:44):**  food circular redesign for food?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:47):**  So what we see is the climate reduction is about 70% reduction when you're doing the  
**[0:20:54-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:20:54):**  redesign approach versus again on potatoes, on what are the four, the three or four, wheat  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:02):**  and dairy.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:03):**  So those are the three that we assessed for some of the changes.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:07):**  And then we also looked at upcycling opportunity, which was a bit of a different approach and  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:10):**  we can speak to that too.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:12):**  Which is massive for sugar, which is super interesting.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:15):**  But what we see in the greenhouse gas emissions reduction for better sourcing is about 50%  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:20):**  reduction, but then you can get further 20% to get 70% total reduction if you take the  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:25):**  circular design for food approach.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:28):**  Actually with biodiversity loss reduction, it's about 20% reduction when you're doing  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:33):**  better sourcing only.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:35):**  But then if you do circular design for food, you got a 50% reduction.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:39):**  Which is massive difference.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:41):**  And a lot of that is the footprint, right?  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:45):**  Maximizing what we're getting from the land and making as much as possible everything  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:49):**  that's coming out, becoming edible and an ingredient.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:53):**  And again, because of that, we see a huge difference, 5% increase in total food output  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:21:59):**  when we're doing better sourcing, but a 50% increase in total food output when we're doing  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:04):**  circular design for food.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:07):**  And then because of that higher total food output and yield, you can say for the farmer,  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:13):**  profitability rather per hectare in US dollars, it could be $200 more with better sourcing  
**[0:22:19-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:19):**  alone or we see about $3,100 in the US for circular design for food.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:26):**  That's massive as well.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:28):**  Yes.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:29):**  That's a huge, those differences, I mean, even on the emissions, it's a lot, but the  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:34):**  other ones are just off the scale.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:36):**  So I think, I mean, I can imagine a lot of these companies get very excited, but what  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:40):**  then, what is the next sort of pathway?  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:42):**  Like you're working on that now, you released this report, obviously it took a while to  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:46):**  write and then it gets released into the world in September and now what are the next steps  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:50):**  or pathways?  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:51):**  I mean, all the companies are excited, but getting them from excitement to actually action,  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:56):**  what does it look like in your ideal world, in the current world as well?  
**[0:22:59-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:22:59):**  Maybe I can speak about the five action areas that we laid out, but before that, I think  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:23:05):**  it could be good to define even what circular design for food is.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:23:09):**  If Elliot, you want to, you want to just lay out the four design opportunities and how  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:23:13):**  we see them being combined.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:23:15):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:23:16):**  So, I mean, yeah, just linking back to very briefly to food design earlier.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:23:21):**  So we mentioned how food design is, it's a set of decisions that are made at the product  
**[0:23:25-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:23:25):**  level about how food should look, it should taste and its price, its nutrition, et cetera.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:23:32):**  And the difference between that, which is done today and circular design for food is  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:23:37):**  applying the principles of the circular economy to every aspect of food design.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:23:40):**  So if I could just run through some of the steps that that could look like.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:23:44):**  So to start with, it's, you actually have to embed this very early on in the product  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:23:50):**  concept stage.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:23:52):**  So in order to give the rest of the team, the agency to try and achieve regenerative  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:23:57):**  outcomes, if you embed that in the product concept, and if you set targets embedding  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:24:02):**  a nature positive regenerative targets in the product brief, then that can give the  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:24:06):**  team down the line much clearer incentives, give the product development team, the research  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:24:11):**  and development team, much clearer incentives to design for these outcomes.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:24:16):**  And then after that, research and development teams and procurement teams who probably traditionally  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:24:21):**  worked in two different silos, probably didn't talk to each other perhaps as much as they  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:24:27):**  could have or should have, they can work together to make the ingredient selection sourcing  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:24:32):**  decisions together.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:24:33):**  So that would mean talking together and deciding what ingredients they should include, how  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:24:38):**  those ingredients should be produced, and then not only that, but then think about how  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:24:43):**  those ingredients could play a role in regenerating landscapes as well.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:24:48):**  And then last but not least, a really important thing as well is actually thinking about the  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:24:52):**  packaging as well, because it wouldn't be much good having a beautiful, like the diverse  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:24:58):**  regenerative up-circuit ingredient based food product that's then put into single use packaging  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:25:03):**  that then goes up in the ocean.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:25:06):**  So these are the different steps that can take place through the design process.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:25:11):**  And we'd argue that those four main design opportunities that companies can use and can  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:25:16):**  combine to achieve the best outcomes.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:25:19):**  So this is using diverse ingredients, using lower impact ingredients, so shifting from  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:25:26):**  ingredients that in a conventional agricultural system have a higher impact to those that  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:25:30):**  have a much lower impact in the conventional agricultural system.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:25:34):**  So that might be shifting from conventional animal based products to plant based ingredients,  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:25:39):**  or it might be shifting from a higher impact plant based ingredient to a lower impact plant  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:25:43):**  based ingredient.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:25:44):**  So that's the second one.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:25:46):**  The third one is including up-circuit ingredients as well.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:25:50):**  So up-circuit ingredients or up-cycling, I should say, is when you take a byproduct of  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:25:56):**  the food industry that's typically considered to be inedible.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:00):**  So it might be a banana skin, it might be spent brewer's grain, the byproduct of the  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:04):**  beer industry.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:06):**  You take those and although they're typically considered to be inedible, you can transform  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:10):**  those into food ingredients to be used in these types of products as well.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:15):**  And then the fourth one, which everyone, all your listeners are very familiar with, is  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:20):**  regeneratively produced ingredients as well.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:22):**  And we found that by combining those four different design opportunities, you can really  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:28):**  get the best outcomes.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:29):**  So just one example of that would be a lower impact ingredient could be switching from  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:36):**  conventional, conventionally produced cow's milk to conventionally grown oat milk, oat  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:41):**  milk made from conventionally grown oats.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:43):**  There's probably a significant reduction in the impacts, but to really maximize that,  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:50):**  you could be growing those oats regeneratively and then having a regeneratively produced  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:53):**  oat milk.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:26:54):**  Or to link it back to the silvo example that we used earlier, you could be producing both  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:00):**  plant-based products and animal-based products in the same system.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:03):**  And that's where you get the most benefits we've found.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:06):**  And potentially using a sweetener that is upcycled.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:09):**  I think there was something in, was it cacao or coffee?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:13):**  How much we throw away of that, of the bean, of at source, which is actually a perfect  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:18):**  sweetener which could replace a very large amount of the sweeteners we use in the world,  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:22):**  which we should be using less, but still we're going to be using that for quite a while and  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:26):**  replacing that with an upcycled, with a waste product basically is a very interesting opportunity  
**[0:27:30-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:30):**  there.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:31):**  And then of course the packaging, which is a whole different topic.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:34):**  And so when are we going to see any of the, because products look amazing.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:37):**  If you look in the imaginary products, obviously, and the models products look amazing, when  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:41):**  are we going to see something similar or maybe even better or more interesting in shelves  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:47):**  or are it going to be pilots launched?  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:48):**  What is next for to making this become a reality and not just an amazing report that's going  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:54):**  to be on a shelf somewhere?  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:55):**  Well, I hope soon, I hope soon.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:27:57):**  I think there's lots of promising efforts and examples that we are starting to see hit  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:02):**  market often very small or quite niche.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:06):**  So the question is like, how do we get the scale piece?  
**[0:28:09-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:09):**  And I think that links to what we call the five action areas for these major food companies,  
**[0:28:16-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:16):**  the FMCGs and retailers that they can already start taking today to get us on that right  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:21):**  trajectory.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:22):**  So the first one is within their own companies, creating these ambitious and well-actioned  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:27):**  or well-resourced rather action plans to transform their entire portfolios, which is a massive  
**[0:28:33-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:33):**  undertaking.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:34):**  And so that's why already we need to get going on the baselining and understand what ingredients  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:39):**  you're using today, where there's a coming from the impacts and then what are the pathways  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:43):**  for transformation?  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:44):**  So that's the first piece.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:46):**  The second is kind of reinvigorating these relationships with farmers and creating a  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:51):**  new collaborative dynamic with farmers.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:54):**  Right now, the relationships can really range where you can be going through multiple suppliers  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:28:59):**  or aggregators as a buyer.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:01):**  And it's often there's a real lack of visibility, but even more so there's something that's  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:07):**  quite qualitative in nature, but it's the relationship with the farmer.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:11):**  And so we are seeing some major food companies starting to do farmer kind of relationship  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:16):**  projects where they are, it's very small at first.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:19):**  I'm working with these farmers to understand what does a regenerative future on that plot  
**[0:29:24-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:24):**  of land actually look like?  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:26):**  Because that's where we need to get to.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:28):**  And it needs to be this two-way conversation of what does the land need?  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:32):**  What would be produced there?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:34):**  Okay, what ingredients do I use today?  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:37):**  And then jumping out forward and saying, what ingredients could I use in the future if I  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:41):**  design products that are ready for market that use those ingredients?  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:45):**  So then it's a demand driven, the right financial incentives are there.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:48):**  The market is actually working for these farmers.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:52):**  And there's ways that companies can modify things like the contracts and the terms, the  
**[0:29:57-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:29:57):**  duration, helping to lower the perceived risk for farmers and create the right incentives.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:30:06):**  And doing things like equipment sharing programs and new innovative ways to support farmers  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:30:12):**  with what they need to go through this transition.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:30:15):**  The third action area is about having iconic products out in market.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:30:21):**  We were mentioning about plant-based milks earlier and I often cite Oatly as a great  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:30:26):**  example of, I would count as being iconic.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:30:29):**  They have amazing marketing.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:30:31):**  That really helped set the plant-based milk alternative industry off on a new trajectory.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:30:37):**  And we need to see these sort of iconic products for what positive impact foods can actually  
**[0:30:43-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:30:43):**  be in the market to inspire industry to move along and show what's actually possible.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:30:49):**  Because until we have that North Star and can see what's possible, we can't start moving  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:30:53):**  towards it.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:30:54):**  But once you have that, it's like the four minute mile, once you overcome what you thought  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:30:58):**  wouldn't even be a threshold you could break, suddenly everyone's able to do it.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:04):**  Not everyone.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:05):**  Yeah, no, it's interesting with Oatly.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:08):**  I mean, there's a lot of discussion on drinking oat milk in general, but we haven't interviewed  
**[0:31:11-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:11):**  them yet.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:12):**  But then of course you get the ones that say, okay, how do you grow these oats?  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:15):**  And wide open agriculture in Australia is very small, but it's very pushing and they  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:19):**  wouldn't be there without an Oatly or they wouldn't be there without.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:23):**  And so you start, yeah, once you overcome like actually a large company in the plant-based  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:28):**  milk space, which probably 10 years ago we thought wouldn't be even possible remotely  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:32):**  possible and they became very large and suddenly everybody else is seeing that as an example  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:38):**  of this is possible.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:39):**  Let's innovate further and let's push it.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:41):**  Let's et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:43):**  And it forces them to be pushed further because of course I think they went public.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:47):**  So they are under huge scrutiny of course of the financial market.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:50):**  So they need to keep pushing as well.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:51):**  So it creates a very interesting flywheel.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:54):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:55):**  And hopefully better contracts for farmers.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:57):**  And that's the underlying.  
**[0:31:58-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:31:59):**  And then there's two final elements and one is really having the foundation of metrics.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:05):**  So what we don't see today, but we'd like to see these businesses doing is contributing  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:11):**  to the development and adoption of common on-farm metrics that are able to measure these  
**[0:32:16-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:16):**  outcomes that we're looking for.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:18):**  And also definitions, which there's lots of debate and confusion and ambiguity around.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:25):**  So that's an important foundational piece to get right.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:29):**  And then the final piece, which I was mentioning briefly earlier is, is policy.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:33):**  So advocating for policies that can support a nature positive food system.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:38):**  Which they can, yeah.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:39):**  Which maybe the small tiny startups can't.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:42):**  I mean, they don't have the capacity to also lobby.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:45):**  And it sounds really like a decommodification of the food industry and not just on the commodifying  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:50):**  part, but also on the recipe part.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:52):**  How much is this a risk to them?  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:54):**  Like how much of these large food companies are made on our successful because of the  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:32:59):**  commodity?  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:00):**  And this is sort of an existential threat, maybe the same as in renewable energy that  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:03):**  we'll see potentially many, but it is a very difficult question, but many energy companies  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:07):**  or oil companies not making the shift.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:09):**  Some will do and some will thrive, but how much of this, this commodification is part  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:14):**  of their DNA or how do you see also there the shifts happening?  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:18):**  Like we need to get closer to farmers, but it means we probably have need some kind of  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:22):**  longterm agreement with them and we cannot just shop around for the cheapest oats.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:25):**  We actually are committed to this.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:27):**  How deep runs this change of this shift?  
**[0:33:30-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:30):**  Well, I think it's all embedded and intertwined with the rise of the industrial food system,  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:37):**  which is linear in nature and their businesses and the models and the types of products that  
**[0:33:41-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:41):**  are offered and commoditization of commodities as you're mentioning are all outcomes of that.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:48):**  And what's really interesting and I often look to as a moment of hope is remembering  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:53):**  that if you look at human history, it's quite a recent little blip where we've really gone  
**[0:33:59-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:33:59):**  off the rails when it comes to food.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:34:01):**  Like I truly believe we have inherently this wisdom and ability to work symbiotically with  
**[0:34:10-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:34:10):**  nature in how we are feeding ourselves.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:34:13):**  That's what we did for ages, right?  
**[0:34:16-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:34:16):**  It's very recent that we've deviated away from that.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:34:19):**  So while there's a system that may look quite locked in and entrenched today, we can transform  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:34:25):**  that and we've seen that happen in things like energy.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:34:29):**  And once you get that momentum going, it can move quite quickly.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:34:35):**  So I think there's, yes, there's some risks of course on the table.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:34:38):**  If you're looking out as a company and go, oh, I want to do this, that's going to be  
**[0:34:42-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:34:42):**  overhauling my supply chain.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:34:44):**  That's going to be all, will it even work, right?  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:34:47):**  Will these numbers actually transpire?  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:34:50):**  But there's much bigger risks on two fronts.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:34:53):**  One is the threats to your supply chain because if you don't get moving, are you going to  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:00):**  exist a hundred years from now if your soils, which are your battery of your supply chain  
**[0:35:05-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:05):**  are dead?  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:06):**  You can't grow food in dead soil, right?  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:08):**  The answer is no.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:10):**  So that's one.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:11):**  And then the other is the market shifting.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:13):**  We are seeing rapidly increasing market growth in areas like organic food, like plant-based,  
**[0:35:21-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:21):**  which is signaling that customers are wanting industry to provide better solutions.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:29):**  Climate awareness is increasing and there's other reasons too, including nutrition.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:32):**  Healthy soil equals high nutrition food.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:36):**  So it's not just about environment, but actually there's a business play here and we're seeing  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:42):**  increasingly that there's a pure competitive advantage in the marketplace.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:47):**  So what's the role of investors?  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:48):**  What should people listening here and entrepreneurs as well, that maybe they're exposed to the  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:52):**  big food companies, of course you can pressure, but I'm not imagining many have like a significant  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:35:57):**  stake in the big eight or the big 10 to actually pressure them on this.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:01):**  What would be the role for smart investors, obviously without giving investment advice  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:05):**  and entrepreneurs in this space, where do you see gaps and the most interesting places  
**[0:36:10-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:10):**  to get to work or to put money to work?  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:12):**  So full disclosure, Emma and I are not investment gurus, but we do have some thoughts on this.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:18):**  And I would not trust any investment guru, by the way, but that's a whole different podcast.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:24):**  No, fair point.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:25):**  But yeah, just a few thoughts on that.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:28):**  I suppose, so redemptive agriculture is an increasingly popular idea right now and I  
**[0:36:33-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:33):**  think rightly so.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:36):**  I think we all fully, all of us on this call right now fully believe that it can solve  
**[0:36:39-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:39):**  many of the problems with the food system like we talked about earlier.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:42):**  There's a lot of goods being done in the space right now.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:45):**  Don't get me wrong at all.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:47):**  I think there are some companies and some organizations that are in the space or maybe  
**[0:36:51-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:51):**  entering the space that maybe have a bit of a shallow understanding of what regenerative  
**[0:36:55-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:55):**  and regeneration really is and really can be.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:36:59):**  And maybe as the idea becomes a bit more popular, it's not a new idea really is it?  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:37:04):**  But as it becomes more popular, I think there could be a risk that it could stray into the  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:37:09):**  realms of greenwashing if they're not careful.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:37:12):**  So I guess my first tip would be that investors should be avoiding any organization that only  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:37:18):**  really demonstrates a shallow understanding of what regenerative really is.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:37:23):**  So a couple of examples I could give would be if an organization is only talking about  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:37:27):**  practices rather than outcomes, so an example of that could be if an organization talks  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:37:33):**  about just applying a couple of practices here and there like no-till for example, regardless  
**[0:37:38-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:37:38):**  of the context and they call that regenerative, that's a bit of a shallow understanding because  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:37:44):**  yeah, don't get me wrong, no-till in certain contexts for certain crops is amazing for  
**[0:37:49-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:37:49):**  soil health.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:37:50):**  It can really work.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:37:51):**  But not in all contexts and not without pairing it with different other practices like cover  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:37:56):**  crops, living mulches with agroforestry and of course not just combining it with practices  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:38:01):**  but combining it with a specific set of practices to achieve a specific set of regenerative  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:38:07):**  outcomes.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:38:08):**  So regenerative isn't about just bolting on a few new practices here and there but it's  
**[0:38:12-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:38:12):**  about transforming landscapes, providing ecosystem services and helping to achieve these outcomes.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:38:19):**  So to summarize that, the first point is not just talking about practices but considering  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:38:24):**  the long-term outcomes but not only considering long-term outcomes but also measuring them  
**[0:38:30-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:38:30):**  as well.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:38:31):**  It's not just enough to talk about carbon sequestration or biodiversity provision but  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:38:36):**  we do need that evidence base, that rigor to measure the outcomes and to make sure that  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:38:42):**  if you're going to invest in payment for ecosystem services for example, to make sure that farmers  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:38:47):**  are appropriately rewarded for the types of outcomes so that they're actually providing  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:38:52):**  not just what a certain practice may or may not provide in any context.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:38:57):**  And then final thought from me is just for food buyers, whether it's food manufacturers,  
**[0:39:03-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:39:03):**  retailers, whoever, to move away from an expectation that they will be able to just source exactly  
**[0:39:09-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:39:09):**  the same ingredients in exactly the same quantities with regenerative as a little add-on at the  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:39:16):**  end to link back to the work on circular design for food like we've talked about for most  
**[0:39:22-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:39:22):**  of this call.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:39:23):**  Yeah, we hope that this is one tool that these companies can use to try and develop a bit  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:39:28):**  more of a nuanced understanding and see how if they apply the principles of circular economy,  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:39:33):**  if they design around what agri-ecosystems can provide, that demonstrates a bit more  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:39:38):**  of a deeper understanding of regeneration.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:39:41):**  And if companies are doing that, then maybe they would be a good bet to invest in.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:39:46):**  And I think it's very interesting, the shallow part and the outcome versus practices.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:39:51):**  And I think we've seen the regenerative washing very strongly already in a number of places.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:39:55):**  And I mean, one is the lack of a definition, which is also a strength at the same time.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:00):**  But looking at the outcome piece and focusing on that and really like, what do we want to  
**[0:40:04-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:04):**  see?  
**[0:40:05-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:05):**  What does the landscape want?  
**[0:40:06-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:06):**  Or what does nature want?  
**[0:40:07-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:07):**  We had an interview on that before.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:09):**  We have to see if it's already out there.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:11):**  Otherwise, I will link it onto tropical gargoyle forestry and really deep discussion.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:14):**  What does this piece of land wants to be or could be or what is actually a full expression  
**[0:40:19-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:19):**  of the full biodiversity of life on that piece?  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:22):**  Which is a very deep question, which most farmers can't ask at the moment because they're  
**[0:40:26-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:26):**  locked into a lot of other things, but which is a very fundamental question to ask at a  
**[0:40:30-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:30):**  landscape scale.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:31):**  Like what could be here and what could be here over the next 20, 30, 40 years with all  
**[0:40:35-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:35):**  the climate models in mind, obviously.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:38):**  So what if you would both or one of you be in charge of a large investment fund?  
**[0:40:43-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:43):**  And it would be, of course, not investment gurus.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:45):**  This is not advice.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:46):**  But if you had to, you're forced to put, let's say, a billion dollars to work.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:50):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:40:51-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:51):**  Where would you start and what would be your priorities?  
**[0:40:54-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:40:54):**  If I can start, to everything that we've discussed today and especially what Elliot was just  
**[0:41:01-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:41:01):**  emphasizing, I think investors are quite well placed to have this helicopter view of a full  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:41:09):**  landscape which very few other actors have.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:41:13):**  And while we can optimize for a single plot of land in that landscape, it's almost like  
**[0:41:18-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:41:18):**  Lego blocks.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:41:19):**  It's like we need to set the conditions for all of those little pieces of that broader  
**[0:41:24-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:41:24):**  tapestry to be part of that regeneration for that place, which sits beyond just the one  
**[0:41:31-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:41:31):**  square plot level.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:41:34):**  So I think I would want to embed that ethos and approach at the very core of that investment.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:41:42):**  But definitely allocating a solid share of it to be directly supporting farmers in their  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:41:50):**  transition because it does take new equipment, it does take training, it does carry costs  
**[0:41:54-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:41:54):**  that we can accelerate this transition if we get the finances right.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:42:00):**  So helping those farmers move, but that's only one piece of the puzzle because we do  
**[0:42:03-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:42:03):**  see some of that already happening and that's great.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:42:06):**  But then how do we link it?  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:42:08):**  Is there a way to structure such a fund or model, for instance, in that you have off-takers,  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:42:14):**  including at least some of these major food buyers to be calibrating their design and  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:42:19):**  demand with the ingredients that are transitioning and evolving over time?  
**[0:42:24-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:42:24):**  Because a farmer who's purely growing coffee today and goes in an agroforestry system,  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:42:29):**  maybe it will be five years, 10 years before they start producing mangoes and different  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:42:34):**  fruits that are also part of that system.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:42:38):**  And so there's this calibration that right now there's a missing link.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:42:44):**  And so there's also a piece around for me, in my dream, if I had one, could a portion  
**[0:42:50-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:42:50):**  of that investment, that one billion, be supporting or investing in really tech innovators to  
**[0:42:58-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:42:58):**  create the digital marketplace for not only having the metrics and the data and transparency  
**[0:43:04-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:04):**  of those ingredients, but also giving those like, you know, in two years and five years,  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:10):**  what's the output of those farms going to be so that it makes it possible suddenly for  
**[0:43:15-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:15):**  these companies to actually have visibility for the first time as to future supplies of  
**[0:43:21-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:21):**  the high integrity, I'll say, like measured ingredients that they're looking for and start  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:27):**  to design their product pipeline accordingly.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:30):**  Because you know it's coming.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:32):**  It's going to complexify, so I'm going to have like in your example, mangoes, etc. coming.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:36):**  I need to be ready to absorb them.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:37):**  Yeah, that's the thing.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:39):**  We need to find ways to lean into the complexity, which is inherent in regenerative systems.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:44):**  And so we can't be scared of that.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:47):**  We need to lean into it.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:48):**  We need to use things like digital, etc. and you know how we structure things like funds  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:54):**  to enable that because otherwise it is simplifying.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:43:57):**  And if we're simplifying, nature isn't simple.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:00):**  Then we get into reductionist approach and it's putting the regenerative label on something  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:05):**  that is not truly having, aiming for positive outcomes.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:10):**  I can sense tension there, but a good tension to have.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:13):**  Like how do we hold that complexity in our supply webs, probably not chains anymore in  
**[0:44:18-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:18):**  the landscapes and it's going to be a bit messy, but it's okay.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:22):**  Yeah, it is going to mean much more distributed models, much more diversity in supply chains  
**[0:44:28-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:28):**  across geographies and yeah, decentralization in some ways.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:34):**  And I think the word like agility as well.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:37):**  So again, it just comes with the diversity of ingredients because we're so far at the  
**[0:44:41-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:41):**  other end of the spectrum today.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:44):**  And you Elliot, what would you do tomorrow morning?  
**[0:44:46-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:46):**  You're an investment guru with a billion dollars under management.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:49):**  Where would you start?  
**[0:44:50-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:50):**  I mean, how do you follow such a nuanced answer as Emma just gave there?  
**[0:44:55-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:55):**  I mean, if I could add it to my fund.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:44:58):**  Yeah, I just pulled, we'd have $2 billion.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:45:02):**  Network effects for sure.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:45:05):**  I think if I can just lean back on the Silvo example that I gave earlier, because I think  
**[0:45:09-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:45:09):**  it was actually a nice example here as well.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:45:11):**  So we talked earlier about how silver pasture has many benefits in terms of ecosystem services,  
**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:45:18):**  but probably one of the big sticking points is when you're setting up a new agroforestry  
**[0:45:22-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:45:22):**  system, well the walnut trees in Silvo's example take somewhere between eight and 13 years  
**[0:45:29-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:45:29):**  to reach maturity and to be bearing a full tree of walnuts.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:45:34):**  And that is obviously a pretty big turnoff for farmers in the current system who have  
**[0:45:38-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:45:38):**  tight margins and who probably don't have the luxury to think in the longterm by spending  
**[0:45:44-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:45:44):**  that type of money that won't pay back for years.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:45:47):**  So I think I would target money towards these types of interventions which have much bigger  
**[0:45:54-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:45:54):**  longer term payoffs that are probably not so appealing to farmers in the short or medium  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:45:58):**  term simply because of the economics behind them.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:46:02):**  So whether that is transition finance to help them plant the trees, whether that is longer  
**[0:46:08-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:46:08):**  term contracts like Emma was talking about so that over a 20 year period, a food buyer  
**[0:46:14-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:46:14):**  can buy initially the milk then the regentive milk as the managed intensive grazing system  
**[0:46:19-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:46:19):**  is established and then once the trees reach maturity then they can start buying the walnuts  
**[0:46:24-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:46:24):**  as well.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:46:25):**  Some kind of incentivization to build those long term contracts.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:46:30):**  And then linked to that as well is the payment for ecosystem services as well which probably  
**[0:46:35-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:46:35):**  agroforestry is particularly a good example of sequestering that carbon.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:46:40):**  I think actually in a silver pasture system where managed intensive grazing takes place,  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:46:44):**  the carbon is stored 50% in the soils and 50% in the trees or so.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:46:49):**  So it's not just the trees, the actual grazing is having a real good effect as well.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:46:53):**  But it's just one example of although we shouldn't just think about practices as I mentioned  
**[0:46:58-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:46:58):**  earlier, it's an example of a practice that probably is very well suited to payment for  
**[0:47:03-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:03):**  ecosystem services.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:04):**  So if all those mechanisms played together, I think that could really make some of these  
**[0:47:10-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:10):**  like longer term thinking objectives work.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:13):**  Basically using the one or two billion to force longer term thinking, if I had to summarize  
**[0:47:19-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:19):**  it, which is extremely needed.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:22):**  We all need the trees and nobody wants to pay for the planting, which sort of sounds  
**[0:47:26-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:26):**  like a finance question.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:27):**  It's like how can we bridge that time between now and eight years or 13 or in the case of  
**[0:47:33-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:33):**  chestnuts could be 20 plus years before they're fully.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:37):**  I mean you get some chestnuts before but and it's amazing because we have some that are  
**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:41):**  planted by the Romans.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:43):**  So if you calculate, we can't, but if we calculate the ROI from that little seed to a tree that  
**[0:47:48-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:48):**  has been producing for a good 2000 plus years, I mean that wouldn't even fit in your spreadsheet,  
**[0:47:53-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:53):**  but still we are unable to find the money to plant many of them.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:47:56):**  And it comes down to processing and de-risking and of course, planning carefully and changing  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:00):**  climates etc. etc. and building the food brands around it, which includes these products.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:05):**  And to ask a final question to both, you already hinted a bit but you were still in your investor  
**[0:48:09-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:09):**  role Emma.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:11):**  What if you had a magic wand to change one thing in the food and agriculture system?  
**[0:48:15-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:15):**  What would that be?  
**[0:48:16-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:16):**  So you're no longer investing.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:17):**  I'm sorry we took away your fund, but you have a magic power, which is pretty powerful.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:21):**  You can change one thing and one thing only.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:23):**  Some people start to say, yeah, the first thing I would do is like, no, this is a one  
**[0:48:26-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:26):**  thing only, but it is powerful because it could be anything from global consciousness  
**[0:48:30-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:30):**  to taste to banning subsidy.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:32):**  I mean anything you can imagine.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:34):**  Well mine would definitely be in the space of rewiring our relationship with food, starting  
**[0:48:41-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:41):**  at a personal level.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:42):**  I mean, I shared at the very beginning that was what set things in motion.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:46):**  The vegetables.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:47):**  For me.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:49):**  And we're in an era where very few of us ever set foot on a farm or really know where our  
**[0:48:56-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:48:56):**  food comes from, the land that grew it, the hands that tended to it, that harvested it.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:49:04):**  And the people and places behind it.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:49:06):**  And food has such a rich story that we used to be so much closer to.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:49:11):**  And as a result of the way we valued it, which can go both ways, right?  
**[0:49:16-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:49:16):**  In terms of how it was produced and what that food actually is in the first place and how  
**[0:49:22-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:49:22):**  we enjoy it.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:49:25):**  It really shifts when we look at the relationship that we have at large today versus probably  
**[0:49:32-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:49:32):**  many generations ago, our ancestors.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:49:35):**  And at the end of the day, again, for so many of us who are in this privileged position  
**[0:49:40-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:49:40):**  where we actually have an abundance of food, we can afford more food than we actually need.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:49:45):**  At the end of the day, food is what we depend on for our existence and our survival.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:49:50):**  But so often we live our entire lives and forget all of that, let alone the incredible  
**[0:49:58-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:49:58):**  other kind of rules that food plays as a centrepiece of culture, of social and convening, of flavour  
**[0:50:05-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:05):**  and experiences that touch all of our senses.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:08):**  So yeah, I think it's just remembering, remembering what food really is for us at this human level.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:15):**  And what about you, Elliot?  
**[0:50:16-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:16):**  What would you change overnight?  
**[0:50:19-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:19):**  Apart from planting trees, obviously everywhere?  
**[0:50:22-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:22):**  I mean, I grew up in rural Leicestershire in the UK and whenever I go back there, I  
**[0:50:29-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:29):**  just, I'm so disappointed with how boring the landscape looks around there, even if  
**[0:50:33-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:33):**  it is all agricultural.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:35):**  It's pretty much rapeseed, commodity grains, maybe some cows, maybe some sheep, but that's  
**[0:50:41-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:41):**  about it.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:43):**  And that's probably one of the main consequences of the industrial food system, isn't it, that  
**[0:50:46-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:46):**  we've gone to this great simplification where farmers probably just do one or two crops  
**[0:50:51-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:51):**  for one or two animals and that's about it.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:54):**  So if I had a magic wand, it would be to bring back diversity that we used to have and to  
**[0:50:58-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:50:58):**  have the countryside filled with thousands and thousands of smaller farms that are producing  
**[0:51:03-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:51:03):**  diverse, locally appropriate varieties of different crops, combining livestock and arable  
**[0:51:10-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:51:10):**  systems on the same farm and yeah, lots of trees as well.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:51:14):**  You probably realise that I'm pretty big into agroforestry and linked to that.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:51:20):**  Yeah, I mean you've probably heard of the term terroir in terms of wine, how the climate  
**[0:51:26-0:51:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:51:26):**  and the soil and geology and all those local conditions really affect the flavours of the  
**[0:51:30-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:51:30):**  grapes and the wine.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:51:33):**  That's always talked about in the context of wine and maybe more so now in the context  
**[0:51:37-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:51:37):**  of coffee and chocolate and a couple of other ingredients.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:51:42):**  I don't see why there's any reason why that couldn't really apply to any food ingredient  
**[0:51:46-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:51:46):**  if we decommodify and move to these more diverse, interesting varieties.  
**[0:51:53-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:51:53):**  So if we could start applying the principles of circular economy to food and create some  
**[0:52:00-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:52:00):**  food products that do celebrate that terroir, that diversity, I think we'd be heading in  
**[0:52:04-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:52:04):**  the right direction for that.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:52:06):**  And maybe we don't need a magic wand, maybe we just need to read the Big Food Redesign  
**[0:52:10-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:52:10):**  and move from there.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:52:12):**  And apply it.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:52:13):**  I want to thank you both so much for your time and unpacking this a bit.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:52:18):**  I mean there's a lot more and I urge everybody to take the report, have a good read and then  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:52:22):**  apply it please because this shouldn't be one of the things that lies in a shelf somewhere  
**[0:52:26-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:52:26):**  digitally or non-digitally.

**[0:53:38-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:53:38):**  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:53:42-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:53:42):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.

**[0:55:25-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:55:25):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:55:27):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:55:32-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:55:32):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:55:37-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:55:37):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could

**[0:55:43-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:55:43):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:55:48-0:55:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:55:48):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:55:52):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:55:57-0:55:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:55:57):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:55:58-0:56:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:55:58):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:56:00):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:56:03):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:56:06):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:56:08):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/emma-chow-eliot-beeby#t=0:56:13):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or whatever you're drinking.

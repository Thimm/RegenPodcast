**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:00:13):**  You're going to listen to a conversation about the role of a trader in the organic  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:00:17):**  fruit and vegetable business in Europe, or as Aosta likes to call themselves, a conductor  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:00:22):**  of an orchestra.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:00:23):**  We dive deeper into the connection between health and organic produce, and how to monetize  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:00:27):**  sustainability, plus changing your profit and loss statements to reflect this sustainability,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:00:33):**  and we discuss the biggest threat to sustainability, anonymity.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:00:37):**  The sound quality of this interview is not always perfect, as we recorded this live at  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:00:43):**  the headquarters of Aosta.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:00:46):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:00:50):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:00:52):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:00:57):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:02):**  and ecosystems, while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:06):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:09):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:12):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:15):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:20):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:25):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:29):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:32):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:36):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:41):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:45):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:50):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:54):**  support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:01:57):**  For more information please find a link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:02):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:06):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:07):**  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the Planet Mattered.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:11):**  I'm here with Volker Engelsmann, co-founder of EOSTA, international distributor of fresh,  
**[0:02:16-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:16):**  organic and fair fruits and vegetables.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:18):**  They take responsibility and transparency to a whole new level and maintain a close  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:22):**  working relationship with more than a thousand growers in six continents.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:25):**  Volker is very proud to say that none of their suppliers ever went back to chemical, non-organic  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:30):**  agriculture.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:31):**  Welcome Volker!  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:32):**  Thank you Koen.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:33):**  So to start with a personal question, as I usually like to start.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:36):**  How did you end up founding, co-founding EOSTA in the food, agriculture and of course the  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:42):**  organic part of that?  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:44):**  Well the slogan of this company is where ecology meets economy, so my roots are also in both  
**[0:02:50-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:50):**  worlds.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:51):**  I think ecology for us also stands for a new society, new agriculture.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:02:58):**  Economy stands for pragmatism.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:03:01):**  And I learned thinking about the world and its future at a Steiner School in Germany.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:03:10):**  Then I decided to study economics and business administration and ended up with Cargill,  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:03:16):**  a big commodity trading company in the US.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:03:19):**  And at some point after a few years of steep learning curves, I ran into a few growers  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:03:28):**  who said we would love to go sustainable and organic but there doesn't seem to be a market.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:03:34):**  So I thought, alright, there should be a market for organic.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:03:39):**  And if there is none, then we'll create one.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:03:41):**  And that was 25 years ago, hence EOSTA.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:03:46):**  And now we've been 25 years later, you have 100 people working here, we're in the headquarters,  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:03:51):**  building a new headquarters which will be done in 6 months.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:03:55):**  100 million revenue, 1000 suppliers.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:03:58):**  What's the main lesson you see, what's the main story you want to bring forward if you  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:04:06):**  look back at the 25 years?  
**[0:04:07-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:04:07):**  The main lesson I would say is the biggest threat to sustainability is anonymity.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:04:16):**  Because usually exploitation rides on the back of anonymity.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:04:20):**  If I don't know you, I can exploit you.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:04:23):**  If I don't know the impact on people and planet, I can exploit people and planet.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:04:28):**  So I thought we can endlessly talk about health and better climate and better environment  
**[0:04:35-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:04:35):**  and social responsibility, but as long as we're not transparent about it, this will  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:04:44):**  be theory and cloud nine talk.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:04:48):**  That's what I really learned from Cargill, a company that trades in anonymous commodities.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:04:56):**  And food is literally commodified.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:05:00):**  It means anonymized.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:05:03):**  So I thought there is no such thing as sustainability without transparency.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:05:08):**  That's why we created this company.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:05:10):**  And the first thing we did was not talk about people and planet, but talk about the true  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:05:17):**  and the real story behind the product.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:05:19):**  So that's what our Nature and More brand does.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:05:22):**  It reveals the true story of each grower by putting a little stamp on each fruit with  
**[0:05:31-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:05:31):**  a QR code and the face of the grower.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:05:34):**  So the consumer is empowered to make an informed purchase decision because he can visit that  
**[0:05:39-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:05:39):**  grower and enter into a dialogue and on the social media and talk about the grower's views  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:05:47):**  on, for instance, soil health or biodiversity or mitigating climate change or what he does  
**[0:05:52-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:05:52):**  to empower his black workforce or his migrant workforce or his workforce in general, what  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:05:59):**  he does to contribute to a fairer distribution of wealth throughout the supply chain.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:06:04):**  And by being transparent about this, we also enable the grower to capitalize on his contribution  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:06:12):**  to people and planet.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:06:13):**  But you take it a few steps further than most companies or some companies that have copied  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:06:18):**  you now and showing the face of one of their suppliers.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:06:23):**  And maybe a bit of the story you're measuring this biodiversity, you're measuring this soil  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:06:27):**  health, you're really taking this transparency, plus you're showing and sharing with your  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:06:32):**  suppliers margins and you're really making it to not even a supplier but a partner.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:06:38):**  It's not a linear relationship.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:06:40):**  They are in the same boat, as we say.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:06:45):**  What's the thought behind it?  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:06:46):**  How far are you going to push this and how far are you pushing that?  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:06:48):**  What are the examples there that really stand out for you?  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:06:52):**  Well, Kun, I think you can't push this far enough.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:06:57):**  Trade in our case is not about trade or buying low and selling high.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:07:02):**  Trade in our case is about running, I mean, responsibly running a supply chain.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:07:09):**  So we rather consider ourselves an air traffic controller rather than a trader.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:07:16):**  So we enter-  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:07:17):**  Or a nice sort of an orchestra.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:07:19):**  Better, much nicer actually.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:07:21):**  So we consider ourselves friends and partners and families with all the suppliers and customers  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:07:28):**  and other stakeholders that form this supply chain together.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:07:32):**  In our journey to reach, to achieve more sustainability, more healthy food, a lower impact of food  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:07:42):**  and farming on, for instance, soil or biodiversity or climate, in order to achieve a positive  
**[0:07:49-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:07:49):**  impact on social, you need to not only monitor sustainability and incremental steps of development,  
**[0:07:58-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:07:58):**  but you also need to empower growers to manage sustainability, which is precisely what we  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:08:06):**  do.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:08:07):**  We go there, we team up with these growers, we send in the troops, we send in the agronomists  
**[0:08:14-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:08:14):**  and help them to embark on a journey that's called sustainability.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:08:21):**  So that will be two M's, monitoring and managing.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:08:24):**  But where is the third and the fourth M?  
**[0:08:30-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:08:30):**  The third would be marketing, because if we would anonymize his product again, then we  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:08:39):**  would talk cleverly about sustainability, but in the end, we wouldn't change the business  
**[0:08:46-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:08:46):**  model and we would join this race to the bottom, price-wise, at the expense of people and planet.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:08:57):**  Which is what we don't like, which we think is where the perverse incentive is in this  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:09:01):**  economy.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:09:04):**  We talk about people, planet and profit, but I think that's outdated.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:09:09):**  I think it's purely and exclusively about profit.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:09:12):**  And yet you are selling to major supermarket chains all around Europe.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:09:17):**  How has been that their response to, we're being open about things, we're bringing our,  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:09:23):**  we're non-anonymizing our suppliers, we're bringing them into this discussion, we're  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:09:28):**  taking them onto a journey and we're not going down the rabbit hole of looking for the lowest  
**[0:09:34-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:09:34):**  possible margin.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:09:35):**  What's the response of the traditional place where most people at the end get their fruits  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:09:40):**  and vegetables?  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:09:42):**  Overwhelming, overwhelmingly positive.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:09:46):**  Why?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:09:49):**  Because if we reach out to the consumer, which we try to do as much as we can, we notice  
**[0:09:58-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:09:58):**  that consumers are not only concerned as a citizen about their health and the people  
**[0:10:05-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:10:05):**  and planet's health, but they also would love to take responsibility as a consumer.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:10:14):**  And we empower them to make an informed purchase decision by talking about health and the impact  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:10:19):**  on people and planet.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:10:20):**  So that's why I'm saying it is purely about profit, not about people and planet.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:10:26):**  Because if you say people and planet and profit, then usually it ends up with people and planet  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:10:32):**  are important, but profit is the most important.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:10:35):**  I think if you only would talk only and exclusively about profit, but you would factor in the  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:10:41):**  costs of people and planet, then you would change your profit definition, which is what  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:10:46):**  we need.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:10:47):**  And what you did.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:10:48):**  It's also what we did.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:10:50):**  So marketing sustainability automatically leads to monetizing sustainability, which would  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:10:56):**  be the fourth M. We have measured the impact.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:11:02):**  We've managed it.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:11:04):**  We've marketed it.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:11:06):**  But if we really want to address the perverse incentives of a wrong profit definition at  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:11:11):**  the expense of people and planet, then you have to monetize this impact as well, which  
**[0:11:15-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:11:15):**  is what we did.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:11:16):**  So we reduced the KPIs to those 20 percent performance indicators with regards to sustainability  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:11:24):**  that define 80 percent of the impact, which is a very pragmatic approach.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:11:29):**  And we teamed up with various United Nations agencies such as FAO, WHO, UNEP, UNDP, with  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:11:38):**  various financial auditors.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:11:41):**  And we concluded that organic is not too expensive, but conventional too cheap, as long as that  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:11:48):**  farming system keeps externalizing costs of people and planet.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:11:53):**  And we achieved enormous backup for that.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:11:57):**  And I believe that in the next few years, sustainability will no longer be an exclusive  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:12:02):**  domain of a few green activists.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:12:05):**  It will increasingly also be in the domain of the financial sector.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:12:10):**  We see new banking, venture capital and investment projects popping up everywhere, including  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:12:19):**  in the institutional investor sector, whereby people say, can we revisit the so-called Ray  
**[0:12:26-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:12:26):**  rocks, the risk adjusted returns on capital, for instance, and factor in a stress test  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:12:34):**  with regards to climate change or soil erosion or biodiversity or ecosystems?  
**[0:12:40-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:12:40):**  Because if we look at our present investments and we do not factor in the costs of climate  
**[0:12:49-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:12:49):**  change or biodiversity loss or child labor or whatever, then that means a potential risk  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:12:57):**  for the future ability to make a profit.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:02):**  To exist in many cases.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:03):**  And to exist.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:04):**  So if we if we jump ahead, let's say in five to 10 years, it will be very difficult for  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:12):**  food and farming operators to attract capital if they do not invest in people and planet.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:19):**  At least I hope so.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:21):**  And simultaneously, it will be very silly for bankers or credit suppliers or venture  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:32):**  capital people to invest in something of which it is not clear what the impact is on people  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:38):**  and planet, because it is like it's like flying in the dark without without instruments or  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:44):**  navigation, which we did for a while.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:46):**  And then luckily, we invented some other things.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:50):**  And we were flying.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:52):**  So what would be your advice if you are an impact investor, which are hopefully all listening  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:55):**  to this show?  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:56):**  You're interested.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:57):**  You're really passionate about food and agriculture.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:13:59):**  You've done your research, read your books.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:14:01):**  Where can you go?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:14:03):**  What would be the first step to to put money to work in this enormously diverse and complex  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:14:10):**  sector that is food and agriculture?  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:14:12):**  Well, I would say first of all, is not enormously complex.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:14:17):**  It's actually quite simple.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:14:19):**  If we want to feed the world and future, then we have to look after the resources that enable  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:14:26):**  us to feed the world.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:14:27):**  And one of the first resources would be soil, soil fertility, which we are killing and losing  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:14:33):**  at a rate of 30 soccer fields per minute, accumulating to 12 million hectares a year,  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:14:37):**  according to the FAO.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:14:40):**  So first of all, let's look after our soils.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:14:44):**  And farmers who do not invest in soils, farmers who use mineral fertilizer and other crap  
**[0:14:50-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:14:50):**  to boost productivity at the expense of soil fertility, they do not deserve to get capital  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:14:58):**  because they are undermining and mining our soil.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:15:02):**  They're depleting their soils.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:15:03):**  So they're undermining their ability to be profitable in the future.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:15:08):**  So it would be very silly for an investor to invest in such an idiot.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:15:13):**  So secondly, we have ones that are building it.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:15:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:15:17):**  So invest in those who are building soils, who are contributing to the water holding  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:15:20):**  capacity of soils, because there's the next second big issue, water, watershed management.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:15:27):**  The overall water household on this planet may be stable, but the extremes between floods  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:15:35):**  on the one side and droughts on the other side will become bigger and not just because  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:15:40):**  of climate change.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:15:42):**  You know, 2% or 2.5% of all water on this planet is fresh water, of which half, I think,  
**[0:15:49-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:15:49):**  is frozen and the other half, so less than 1%, is available for us, and of which 70%  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:15:57):**  is used by agriculture.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:15:59):**  So you're turning a big lever there.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:16:02):**  If you manage your soils properly and you invest into the water holding capacity of  
**[0:16:07-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:16:07):**  soils, then you can do with enormous amounts less water.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:16:14):**  So irrigation in Holland may be not so expensive, but in other parts of the world, it's extremely  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:16:19):**  expensive.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:16:20):**  So soil, proper soil management contributing to your organic matter contents is crucially  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:16:29):**  important, not only because of fertility and your ability to produce in future, but also  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:16:34):**  because of water holding capacities.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:16:36):**  Thirdly, because of your contribution to biodiversity, which is where your vitality bank is.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:16:46):**  Diversity means vitality, and we see an immediate and direct connection between diversity, biodiversity,  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:16:55):**  and the ability of a plant to deal with pests and diseases.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:16:59):**  Which third component and the fourth component?  
**[0:17:02-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:17:02):**  No, well, at first, the fourth component would be mitigation of climate change, because 40%  
**[0:17:10-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:17:10):**  of all greenhouse gases are caused, are borne by food and agriculture, of which half is  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:17:17):**  caused by mineral fertilizer, nitrous oxide emissions, and the other half by methane.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:17:24):**  So before we talk about feeding the world, one thing is for sure, we cannot, we can't  
**[0:17:31-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:17:31):**  afford to keep eating meat, as long as, you know, the footprint of its animal feed production  
**[0:17:39-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:17:39):**  is so huge in terms of monoculture of soybeans and maize, that are so big that they, that  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:17:48):**  you can't rotate them with any other crop for soil fertility reasons.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:17:54):**  So you have to apply shitloads of mineral fertilizer, which depletes soils, which creates  
**[0:18:00-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:18:00):**  a water footprint of 15,000 litres per kilo of beef, which is completely ridiculous, of  
**[0:18:07-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:18:07):**  which 98% is caused by irresponsible farming techniques, which produces 20% of all the  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:18:14):**  greenhouse gases.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:18:15):**  And then you have beef that actually produces methane, which is the other half of the 40%  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:18:22):**  of food and agriculture emissions.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:18:24):**  So it's simply not sustainable.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:18:27):**  So why is it still simple?  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:18:29):**  Well, it's simple, because we have to look after our soils, water, biodiversity and climate  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:18:33):**  change.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:18:34):**  And what we need to embark on is in order to mitigate risk of losses, also financial  
**[0:18:42-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:18:42):**  losses, we have to not only look at productivity per hectare, we have to look at climate smart,  
**[0:18:52-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:18:52):**  forestry smart, water smart, and particularly soil smart agriculture.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:18:58):**  And these suppliers of you, they are on that journey.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:02):**  How closely you work with them?  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:03):**  What's the, when a supplier says in South Africa, I guess they're making table grapes  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:08):**  for you, and they say, we want to do more Falkor, we want to do more.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:12):**  What's your response?  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:13):**  You send in the troops, how close are you?  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:15):**  Because this is not a normal supplier trader relationship.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:18):**  This is a partnership that goes way further.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:20):**  Can you give an example on how that works?  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:24):**  Just to understand that this is another paradigm of doing business in the fruit and vegetable  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:29):**  sector?  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:30):**  Well, it's actually a good example that grape grower in South Africa, maybe you deliberately  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:35):**  chose it.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:36):**  I think we've discussed it before.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:37):**  All right.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:38):**  Well, this guy is a visionary guy who at some point discovered that he can produce bigger  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:47):**  quantities, better quality if he invests in soil fertility.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:53):**  And it cuts down his costs, but it also cuts down his irrigation bill and his pest and  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:19:58):**  disease pressure.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:20:00):**  It does a lot of things that are not only good for people and planet, but also is for  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:20:05):**  his income.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:20:09):**  And then we discovered together with the World Bank that the Sundaes River Valley in South  
**[0:20:18-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:20:18):**  Africa is suffering from a huge problem because the Sundaes River stops producing water for  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:20:25):**  some strange reason.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:20:28):**  Which is a big issue because 70% of all South Africa's citrus production is based in the  
**[0:20:33-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:20:33):**  Sundaes River.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:20:34):**  Speaking about risks.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:20:37):**  So they were sort of on a suicide mission.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:20:41):**  Why?  
**[0:20:42-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:20:42):**  Because all this stuff, this alien vegetation that polluted these rivers was caused by enhanced  
**[0:20:50-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:20:50):**  fertile climate as a result of mineral fertilizer leakage into the groundwater produced by these  
**[0:20:58-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:20:58):**  citrus farmers.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:20:59):**  So you see where I'm getting at.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:21:01):**  So World Bank said, okay, we invent this project working for water, which means that we send  
**[0:21:08-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:21:08):**  in labor that's providing jobs and they cut back all the alien vegetation from these rivers.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:21:17):**  That's water.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:21:18):**  So we provide the valley again with water.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:21:22):**  And that's where we moved in, teamed up with Sundaes River Citrus Corporation, a huge co-op  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:21:30):**  that controls I think 60 or 70% of the citrus production in the area.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:21:35):**  We teamed up with them and said, how about if we take that stuff that's cut out of the  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:21:41):**  green stuff that's cut out of the rivers?  
**[0:21:43-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:21:43):**  How about if we use that as a input for our compost and we produce our own compost and  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:21:51):**  compete with mineral fertilizer suppliers?  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:21:54):**  Which is what we did.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:21:56):**  So we started producing compost in huge numbers.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:21:59):**  Because there was a lot of stuff in the river.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:01):**  There was a lot of stuff in the river.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:03):**  Drawers began to collectively cut down on their mineral fertilizer.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:09):**  So that stopped leakage.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:10):**  And in the meantime, they were building soils again and investing into organic matter contents  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:16):**  in their soils.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:19):**  So there would be no leakage and there would be no problem with the rivers anymore.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:23):**  Plus they would be more independent from external agrochemical input supply.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:29):**  Which most farmers don't like to be anyway.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:31):**  Which most farmers don't like to be anyway.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:33):**  So it's a very silly model.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:35):**  And you started to, they became, or they already were suppliers of you or you started to also?  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:41):**  No, then they, not all of them, but the majority of them converted to organic, which are still  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:47):**  today our biggest citrus suppliers.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:52):**  So then we went to the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and applied for carbon  
**[0:22:59-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:22:59):**  credits, which we got on the delta of methane gas emission.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:23:06):**  Because in the past, all this green stuff was land filled, producing methane.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:23:13):**  And now we started composting it, cutting down on the methane.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:23:18):**  And as a result, we got carbon credits on that delta.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:23:21):**  So we all of a sudden, without knowing, produced three yields, three income revenue streams.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:23:29):**  One was these growers could sell their compost to also neighboring farms, income revenue  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:23:34):**  one.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:23:36):**  They could sell their carbon credits, revenue two.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:23:39):**  And they could sell their citrus to us, revenue three.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:23:43):**  So that model was then copied to municipalities and Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth and  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:23:52):**  other bigger cities in South Africa, where we started collecting all the green waste,  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:23:57):**  not from rivers, but just green waste from the cities.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:24:01):**  Started collecting it, cutting it down, making compost and closing the carbon cycle by shipping  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:24:09):**  that back to the farmers.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:24:11):**  Which was a model that was then copied to Mexico, Argentina, Chile, India, China, etc.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:24:20):**  So it's a very sustainable model that does not only contribute to soil fertility, water  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:24:27):**  and capacity and mitigation of climate change.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:24:30):**  But it most of all frees up growers from being held hostage by an agrochemical input business  
**[0:24:41-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:24:41):**  that parasites on farming, like the pharmaceutical industry parasites on your health by selling  
**[0:24:50-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:24:50):**  a little bit of pills or agrochemicals with a few side effects for which they have new  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:24:57):**  pills or agrochemicals again.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:25:00):**  So this is a very sustainable model for the input suppliers, very sustainable, but not  
**[0:25:07-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:25:07):**  very sustainable for the planet or for the growers or for the consumers.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:25:14):**  And it's quite easy to break that.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:25:16):**  You just need to look at returns in a different way.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:25:22):**  Our friends call it, have a look at your natural capital returns or social capital or inspirational  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:25:29):**  capital returns.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:25:30):**  Well, that's precisely what we do, except that we do not only look at the returns, we  
**[0:25:35-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:25:35):**  also monetize them.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:25:37):**  So we recently created a dashboard together with EYKPMG, PWC, a few other, a few banks  
**[0:25:44-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:25:44):**  in a pilot called true cost accounting for food, farming and finance, in which we actually  
**[0:25:52-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:25:52):**  measured and monetized the impact on soil, water, climate, livelihoods and health, provided  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:02):**  these impacts with a monetary value and produced our first profit and loss account based not  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:09):**  just on financial capital, but also on natural and social capital, which was a, I think a  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:15):**  revolutionary step.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:17):**  How did it look?  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:19):**  I mean, normal profit and loss are usually pretty boring, but in this case, what are  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:24):**  one or two highlights from that that really surprised you or really gave you a good feeling  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:28):**  or a bad one maybe?  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:30):**  Well, it was mixed.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:32):**  First of all, we noticed that we were correct in the assumption that organic is not too  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:37):**  expensive, but conventional is too cheap, as long as we keep externalizing costs to  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:43):**  future generations.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:45):**  Secondly, that was quite revolutionary.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:49):**  We noticed that organic apples are 19 cents healthier per kilo than conventional apples,  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:56):**  which is something we haven't talked about yet.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:26:58):**  We talked about the impact on planet.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:27:01):**  We haven't addressed social impact or health impact yet, but this is an example that if  
**[0:27:07-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:27:07):**  you leave out pesticides, which is what organic farming does, then that actually also has  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:27:16):**  a 19 cent per kilo impact on your health as a consumer, just as a consumer.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:27:22):**  And what we simply did is we took data from EFSA, from the European Food Safety Agency,  
**[0:27:28-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:27:28):**  and fed those data of pesticides and residue occasions.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:27:37):**  We fed that into the DALI, the Disability Adjusted Life Year calculation, which is a  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:27:43):**  monetization tool used by the WHO of the United Nations.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:27:47):**  So this data was out there.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:27:49):**  The data was out there, the template was out there, and we had EY validating this calculation.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:27:59):**  That's how we achieved this 19 cent per kilo health advantage, by the way, defined in a  
**[0:28:07-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:28:07):**  very limited way, of course, because just absence of pesticides, absence of disease.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:28:14):**  Health, as we all know, is much wider, much bigger, not just physical, it's also social,  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:28:19):**  it's mental, it's about vitality.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:28:22):**  But this in itself was already revolutionary itself.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:28:27):**  Thirdly, we got an overwhelming response from the financial sector thanking us for being  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:28:36):**  the first, almost, together with other pioneers, to provide them with a dashboard so they would  
**[0:28:42-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:28:42):**  have indicators to not only look at people and planet impact from a qualitative point  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:28:50):**  of view, but also from a monetized point of view.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:28:53):**  What does it mean at the end?  
**[0:28:55-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:28:55):**  Because of course they love to have that number.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:28:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:28:58):**  And if you have that number, even if it's a limited range, it means that probably the  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:29:03):**  total range is a lot bigger, you just don't know the X.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:29:05):**  But you have already the 19 cents, or on the apple and the mango, etc., are different,  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:29:11):**  but you know, you can start calculating, which is in many cases what we miss.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:29:16):**  We don't know what an organic apple does to you, but we do know what a chemical one does,  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:29:20):**  so we can have that difference.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:29:23):**  You know, finance is also about risk management, probably...  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:29:27):**  Mostly.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:29:28):** ...totally about risk management, isn't it?  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:29:32):**  And risk mitigation.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:29:33):**  A bad investment kills your return, and a good investment doesn't make it usually.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:29:37):**  So you can be pennywise, pound foolish, and ignore those ecological and social or health  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:29:45):**  risks.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:29:46):**  Or you can say, well, even if my short-term profit driven shareholder doesn't realize  
**[0:29:53-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:29:53):**  it, I have at least a governance responsibility to warn him for certain risks.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:30:04):**  And in the wake of the Paris Climate Agreement, it is likely that the authorities will have  
**[0:30:13-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:30:13):**  a look at the impact on climate of companies and sectors and public sector, etc.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:30:21):**  So if you want to establish a risk analysis on the possible effect of a carbon tax or  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:30:30):**  whatever will be launched, then you better be prepared.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:30:35):**  And the Central Bank in Holland recently launched this stress test to see what the profitability  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:30:42):**  of companies and sectors like the insurance sector and institutional investor sector would  
**[0:30:47-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:30:47):**  look like if they would have to compensate for their climate change damage.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:30:54):**  And the data is in, or they're in the process?  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:30:56):**  I don't know.  
**[0:30:57-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:30:57):**  But just the fact that they...  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:30:58):**  The Central Bank of the UK mentioned that the biggest threat to the economy or to us  
**[0:31:04-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:04):**  is climate change.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:06):**  Shock, which made it to the front page of Financial Times, which is good and bad at  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:10):**  the same time.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:11):**  I mean, that shouldn't have been news, but it's...  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:14):**  No, but sustainability is definitely hitting the financial sector.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:19):**  And the fact...  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:20):**  And other...  
**[0:31:21-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:21):**  You see symptoms.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:22):**  You don't see the real footprint yet and the consequences, but that's a matter of time.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:29):**  But if you want to look beyond the garden fence and not too far away, you can clearly  
**[0:31:36-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:36):**  see what will happen.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:39):**  And the fact that Standard & Poor bought TrueCost, I don't know if you followed that.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:44):**  I didn't see that, but that's very interesting.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:45):**  It's a UK-based true cost accounting NGO or...  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:50):**  How did they buy that?  
**[0:31:52-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:31:52):**  Well, they decided if we want to establish a proper risk analysis of a company or a sector  
**[0:32:03-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:32:03):**  or a government or a country, then we better factor in risks of climate change and, I mean,  
**[0:32:11-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:32:11):**  the risks of people on planet.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:32:13):**  And so you see all these signs, you see the carbon tracker discussion around stranded  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:32:18):**  acids of the oil sector.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:32:24):**  So I think these are all sort of the first telltales of a next decade that will show  
**[0:32:36-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:32:36):**  us that will confront us with a few disruptive changes that may have a multiplier effect  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:32:45):**  because one would say, well, okay, it's just about climate change.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:32:50):**  But my guess is that if people start talking about climate change, they will automatically  
**[0:32:55-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:32:55):**  also end up talking about the second largest carbon bank on the planet, which is soils  
**[0:33:02-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:33:02):**  after the oceans.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:33:03):**  Plus...  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:33:04):**  It's immediately related to climate change.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:33:06):**  So before you know, you talk about soil fertility, you talk about water, you talk about biodiversity.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:33:10):**  Farms, health, yeah.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:33:13):**  And yeah, and well, millions of consumers who are seriously concerned about the fact  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:33:20):**  that 70% of their health bill is food related.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:33:23):**  So can we get more transparency with regards to the health impact of what we eat, please?  
**[0:33:31-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:33:31):**  Which is where our 19 cents come in per kilo.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:33:34):**  So I'm foreseeing bigger moments of disruptive change that will allow new pioneers and new  
**[0:33:45-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:33:45):**  startups and new businesses who capitalize on a positive impact on people and planet.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:33:53):**  That will attract new money.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:33:55):**  As a matter of fact, those who are stuck in the old 1.0 profit definition, they will be  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:02):**  fucked to put it mildly.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:06):**  And those who have factored in...  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:08):**  Who do you sell it to?  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:09):**  I mean, it's called stranded assets for a reason because you're going to be stranded  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:13):**  and you're not going to be able to sell it to anybody anymore.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:17):**  So what's next for Josta?  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:18):**  I mean, this huge next 10 years, a lot of disruptive change, huge changes in how many  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:24):**  businesses are around, many startups, like you mentioned, many newcomers coming into  
**[0:34:28-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:28):**  the space.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:29):**  Because for you in the medium, medium long term, what do you see, what are you excited  
**[0:34:34-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:34):**  about in the next few years?  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:36):**  If we talk in a year from now and two years from now, what would you be excited about  
**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:40):**  if you can share them obviously?  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:41):**  No, I would love to.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:42):**  Look, it's simple.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:43):**  Demand for organic produce is soaring.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:46):**  So is exponentially growing by 15%.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:50):**  I don't think there's any IT sector that's growing so fast.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:54):**  Yet it is still small, particularly in this country, in Holland, but the average in the  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:34:59):**  rest of Europe is, you know, and if you look in mainstream retail, it's anything between  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:03):**  20 and 40%.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:05):**  So it is already mainstream.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:07):**  So we are way behind when it comes to fulfilling that demand.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:13):**  But you sell 95% outside the Netherlands.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:16):**  Yeah, 98.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:17):**  You're located here in 98.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:19):**  But let's say in the Netherlands, we need to catch up.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:21):**  There's a huge...  
**[0:35:22-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:22):**  No, you know, as an entrepreneur, you don't care about your home country.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:25):**  At least I don't.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:26):**  I don't care about Holland.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:28):**  What happens here?  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:29):**  No, it's more, you know, we are Europe-wide players when it comes to markets.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:35):**  And we just see this enormously exponentially growing demand.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:40):**  And we can't, we are seriously concerned about supply.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:43):**  So we need new suppliers.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:45):**  There's a huge investment potential for growers and investors to scale up.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:52):**  Is that something you work with others with?  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:54):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:55):**  With traditional banks, investors, etc.?  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:35:58):**  So that's something you're probably... because at the end, you cannot do it all alone.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:36:02):**  I mean, you are a big company and a small company at the same time.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:36:04):**  No, but we remain a traffic controller.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:36:06):**  We are not a bank.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:36:07):**  We're not a grower.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:36:08):**  We're not, you know, we're supply chain managers.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:36:11):**  So we need to co-create with environmental agencies, with UN agencies, with financial  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:36:19):**  actors and with those who have a vision.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:36:24):**  So back to your question where I see that would be the next challenge in the next few  
**[0:36:29-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:36:29):**  years.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:36:30):**  First of all, big demand for organic.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:36:32):**  And you need to be specific about what commodities, what crops, what products.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:36:38):**  Secondly, I see great potential in co-creating new models of return between the sustainability  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:36:50):**  sector in food and agri and the financial sector.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:36:54):**  So if we could come up with a new dashboard to measure impact on people and planet and  
**[0:37:00-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:37:00):**  report on natural and social capital rather than just on financial capital only, if we  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:37:07):**  would... and we have that tool and we would team up with bigger retailers and other players,  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:37:13):**  then that would be giving a boost to sustainability, I'm sure.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:37:19):**  But that is an umbrella approach, a generic meta approach, which we will be pursuing.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:37:26):**  If you zoom in, we've so far always been looking at the environmental benefits when it comes  
**[0:37:32-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:37:32):**  to organic farming.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:37:34):**  We've also looked into the social benefits when it comes to fair trade certification.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:37:40):**  But we're increasingly beginning to look and that's a campaign we will just be launching  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:37:46):**  next January.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:37:48):**  We also be looking at the health impact of food.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:37:53):**  And we've called it Dr. Good Food.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:37:56):**  So we'll provide all our packages, millions of packages, with a little campaign logo that  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:38:03):**  says Dr. Good Food.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:38:05):**  And drgoodfood.com will be a website where chefs, but also medical doctors, dieticians  
**[0:38:17-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:38:17):**  and consumers and NGOs will team up to raise more awareness for the proactive healthcare  
**[0:38:24-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:38:24):**  of food.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:38:26):**  And we will have flash mobs at the food and veg, in the food and veg department of big  
**[0:38:33-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:38:33):**  retail customers, partners, flash mobs with students in white doctor coats and stethoscopes  
**[0:38:42-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:38:42):**  handing out fruit and veg and little pliers to point out what the connection is between  
**[0:38:49-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:38:49):**  health and food.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:38:51):**  Because that's the next big challenge and I smell momentum there.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:38:56):**  And it will contribute to our unique selling point in the market.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:01):**  So in the past we've been promoting the bees, we're promoting with our Save Our Soils campaign,  
**[0:39:07-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:07):**  we've been promoting soils.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:10):**  There's a direct connection, soil, food, health.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:13):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:14):**  But consumers like single issue.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:19):**  Everything is connected in nature, that's the nice thing.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:22):**  Yeah, you need to be specific, you have half a second to make a difference, attention to  
**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:28):**  when somebody decides left or right.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:32):**  So I see momentum there.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:34):**  And then we'll take it from there.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:37):**  Lots to do.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:38):**  Thank you so much Fogart for your time.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:39):**  We'll be checking in on all of these projects and thank you for taking the time to share.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:45):**  Thank you, Kon.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:46):**  Pleasure.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:47):**  You just listened to a conversation with Fogart Engelsmann, co-founder of EOSTA, where we  
**[0:39:52-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:52):**  discussed the role of an air traffic controller in the organic food supply web.  
**[0:39:56-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:39:56):**  What's next for this 30-year-old organic company?

**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:42:46):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:42:51-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:42:51):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to

**[0:43:18-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:43:18):**  It's not a list of investable deals.

**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:43:22):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:43:26):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/01/volkert-engelsman/#t=0:43:28):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

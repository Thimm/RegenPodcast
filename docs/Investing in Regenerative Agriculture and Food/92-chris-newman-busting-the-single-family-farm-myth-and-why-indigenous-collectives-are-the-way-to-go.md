**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investing in regenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:14):**  Why does regenerative agriculture not scale beyond the often single family farm?  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:19):**  What if we unleash the power of economics of scale, specialization and actually building  
**[0:00:23-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:23):**  wealth within regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:26):**  How would that look like?  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:27):**  Today, we go deep into the issues of single family farms, the potential of collectives  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:31):**  to manage whole landscapes, way more effective, producing more food and wealth, and what does  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:36):**  inclusion mean within farming and why seed keepers and livestock breeders are the key  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:40):**  to our survival.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:44):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:48-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:48):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:49):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:54):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:00:59):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:04):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:06):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:10-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:10):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:12):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:17):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:21):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:26):**  our work.

**[0:01:46-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:46):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:47):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture today with Chris  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:50):**  Newman, founder of Sylvan Aqua Farms.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:53):**  Welcome Chris.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:54):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:56):**  Personal question to start with.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:57):**  Why soil?  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:58):**  Why farming?  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:01:59):**  Because you don't have the background like many people actually in this space.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:02):**  What drew you to the land?  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:04):**  Initially it was purely selfish reasons.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:06):**  I was working in tech.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:07):**  I had a health scare that basically resulted from the stress of my job working as a technology  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:12):**  consultant near Washington, D.C.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:14):**  And my wife and I had always planned on doing some kind of agricultural project around indigenous  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:19):**  meats, indigenous land stewardship.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:21):**  Bison I heard as well.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:22):**  Yeah, bison was the initial thing we were focusing on or thought we were going to focus  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:26):**  on.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:27):**  So we decided to end my tech career and move that plan up.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:30):**  Bison did not happen because I went to a bison farm in central Virginia maybe a few months  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:35):**  before the farm started and I watched a bison cow jump over a five or six foot fence from  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:40):**  a standstill and said, okay, this is not, I don't have the money to build 10 foot high  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:46):**  Jurassic Park fences all over the place.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:48):**  So we decided to go with something a little smaller, a little more reasonable, less dangerous,  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:53):**  less wild and just got into poultry and pork to start with.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:57):**  They can fly.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:02:58):**  Oh, they can fly, but they can't kill you.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:01):**  I don't know unless they turn into like Jurassic Park velociraptors and really come after you.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:06):**  I don't know if that hasn't happened yet.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:08):**  So we started off with them just from a number of things.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:11):**  We read things by people like Alan Savery, Andre Poisson, a few other people.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:17):**  There's some figures in the regenerative ag movement that now I kind of frankly have a  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:21):**  lot of issues with.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:22):**  We'll get into that.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:24):**  But we got into it from them and our journey kind of started with the whole like small  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:29):**  holding, almost juiced up homesteading kind of model.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:33):**  But the engineer in me just could not help but do the math around the amount of food  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:37):**  that needed to be produced and the amount of food that this movement was producing.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:41):**  And we quickly realized that there was kind of a lot of virtue signaling going on in the  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:46):**  regenerative ag movement.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:47):**  We weren't operating at the scale that we needed to.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:50):**  We were still operating under some very perhaps not so great assumptions around farming oriented  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:03:56):**  around nuclear families and oriented around command and control ownership and retaining  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:02):**  that farm owner, farm worker divide that tends to be fairly exploitive.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:06):**  So there were a number of issues that me coming in from as a complete outsider, like not only  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:11):**  an agricultural outsider, but a cultural outsider, I think made me able to look at things from  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:16):**  kind of a different lens and maybe with a more critical lens to a regenerative agriculture  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:20):**  and some of the problems that I was seeing.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:22):**  So that's just kind of how we got started down this path toward where we're kind of  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:26):**  a almost a countercultural organization within the movement where we're looking at scale.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:30):**  We're looking at integration.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:31):**  We're busting up the whole family farm paradigm because there's just a lot of problems.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:36):**  There's so much to unpack there, but it's interesting that you thought you were going  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:39):**  to a lower stress environment and you probably didn't.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:44):**  No, but it was.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:46):**  It's different for something.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:48):**  The tech job was for a paycheck.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:50):**  I grew up not exactly poor, but definitely poor adjacent and could see what the consequences  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:56):**  of failure would be.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:04:57):**  So a lot of what I'd been doing was running away from fear and you're working 15, 16 hours  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:04):**  a day, sleeping at the office, not seeing your family, not seeing your friends.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:08):**  And it's like for what is you get this money that you don't spend on anything because I'm  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:11):**  not a very high class kind of guy.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:13):**  So that kind of stuff piles up.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:15):**  There is for farming, pulling chicken trackers in a thunderstorm and harvesting pawpaws when  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:21):**  it's a thousand degrees outside.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:22):**  And that means something.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:23):**  There's a connection to it.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:25):**  It comes from a place of trying to do good and fix a lot of very difficult problems that  
**[0:05:30-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:30):**  affect a lot of people.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:31):**  So it's good stress.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:32):**  It's a good thing to keep you up at night and be stressed out about.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:35):**  So let's unpack some of the issues you see.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:38):**  Let's start with scale.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:39):**  What's up with the image we have of the one family that runs one farm that owns the farm  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:45):**  and wants to do regenerative stuff basically a bit like you started as a bigger homestead  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:49):**  in many cases, because that's what you can afford if you have to buy the land.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:54):**  What's the issue?  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:55):**  What does the engineer say to that in terms of issues?  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:05:57):**  Well, the fundamental issue is this kind of unspoken strategy around at least the part  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:06:03):**  of the regenerative movement that's in love with the idea of a small yeoman family farm  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:06:09):**  is that the strategy is to compete with traditional agribusiness in the aggregate.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:06:13):**  So there's supposed to be lots and lots of these little farms spinning up and together  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:06:18):**  they're supposed to be able to challenge the power of income in agribusiness.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:06:22):**  The problem is that if these farms are going to replicate like that, it would have happened  
**[0:06:26-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:06:26):**  already, but it's not because it's too difficult to make a living as a farmer doing that just  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:06:34):**  for any number of reasons.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:06:36):**  There's very little historical precedent for that kind of farming to actually work without  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:06:40):**  creating some kind of exploitative relationship with the people who are doing it.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:06:44):**  We don't associate yeoman farming with really savory parts of at least American history.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:06:50):**  I don't know about global history, but at least here it's not such a great thing.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:06:54):**  But no, I mean, one of the things that you hear agricultural gurus, Joel Salzen and various  
**[0:07:01-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:01):**  others who espouse this model tend to gloss over the ways they had to get lucky and the  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:10):**  things they had to be handed in order for their models to work.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:14):**  Most people who make it have to have very deep social safety nets.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:17):**  They usually have to inherit something, whether it's a house, whether it's land, whether it's  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:20):**  both, whether it's a bunch of money to be able to fail over and over again while they  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:25):**  learn the trade, make mistakes, learn how to both grow food, process food and trade  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:30):**  food, which are three completely separate businesses all in one.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:34):**  It's just, there's not enough people who are inclined toward that entrepreneurial mindset  
**[0:07:39-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:39):**  to be able to do that.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:41):**  There's lots of people who can grow food well.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:43):**  There's lots of people who can process food well.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:45):**  And there's people that are good at trading, but it's incredibly unusual to find all three  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:50):**  in the same person.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:52):**  And it's even more unusual to find all three in that same person with the inheritance and  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:07:58):**  the safety net and all of these things that you need in order to make it.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:02):**  These handful of people that have made it.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:04):**  If you actually look at their balance sheets and their tax returns, you find things that  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:07):**  go, oh, well, gee whiz, I could have done that if I'd inherited 550 acres.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:13):**  So yeah, the issue is that the scale by working in the aggregate just isn't going to work.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:18):**  This is just not going to happen.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:19):**  You can't get enough of these things spun up because the work is too hard to really  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:24):**  do by yourself.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:26):**  So that's where we really got the idea of if farms were to operate at a larger scale,  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:31):**  if they were to draw more people into a collective rather than working from that top down command  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:36):**  and control model where you've got an owner who owns all the assets and they're paying  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:40):**  and the hands.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:42):**  And they've got their people underneath them who they're usually barely paying under the  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:45):**  guise of an internship or a wolf or whatever.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:49):**  If you get away from that and you start to expand it and actually offer the pie to people  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:53):**  as you scale up, you're able to engage in farming in a way that's less exploitive on  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:08:58):**  people, less exploitive on the landscape.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:00):**  And the other part of scale is just the fact that we need to get big.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:04):**  If you're going to compete with Big Egg, you have to compete as a large entity.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:09):**  And you're just not going to do that with a million independent farms all doing their  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:13):**  own thing, uncoordinated, not leveraging economies of scale, repeating all kinds of work.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:19):**  I mean, the engineer in me just thinks about like decentralized processing units and things  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:23):**  like that.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:24):**  It's like, no, there's really no way to do that.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:27):**  Every individual farmer doing the exact same things, spending the exact same money.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:32):**  And driving on Saturday to the farmer's market.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:34):**  Yeah, you've got 100,000 people driving their cars to 100,000 different markets and you've  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:38):**  got 10,000 poultry farmers all buying the same equipment.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:41):**  It's like, why?  
**[0:09:43-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:43):**  The amount of inefficiency that comes from our failure to scale.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:45):**  I mean, I did an audit of my own business and just tried to attribute how much of our  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:50):**  price point is owed to inefficiencies just because we don't do things to scale.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:55):**  We can't buy feed in bulk.  
**[0:09:57-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:57):**  We don't share markets.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:09:59):**  We don't lease space on the supermarket shelf.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:01):**  We drive ourselves to the market and do all this stuff.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:04):**  And it came out to be in something like near 20% of our price is just inefficiency of smallness.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:10):**  And what was the trigger for you and your wife to say, okay, we're letting go of this  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:14):**  Homestead Plus idea and start exploring collectives, etc.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:19):**  Was there that audit?  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:20):**  Was there something else that you suddenly realized this doesn't make any sense?  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:24):**  Yeah, it's funny.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:25):**  It came from a movie called War Docs, which is just a stupid movie.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:28):**  I think future Michael Cera and whoever that other guy is that he's always in movies with.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:32):**  It was a movie about these arms dealers who were going through FedBizOps just to like,  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:37):**  I don't know, buy guns and arms or whatever from Eastern Europe and bring them to the  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:41):**  United States and sell them to the federal government.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:43):**  But it was funny that I hadn't really thought about FedBizOps since I left government consulting  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:48):**  several years ago.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:49):**  So what is FedBizOps just for anybody outside?  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:52):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:53):**  FedBizOps is basically a central repository for all of the publicly available federal  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:10:58):**  government contracts in the United States.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:01):**  So like anything that the government needs, whether it's weapons, food, I don't know,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:07):**  diapers, equipment, like whatever they need somebody private to bid on and to provide  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:12):**  to the federal government goes on this website.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:14):**  So I just decided, you know, I hadn't been there in forever since I was bidding on like  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:18):**  software services and stuff like that.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:20):**  I figured, you know, what's food like because federal government has to buy food.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:23):**  And so I just decided to look for it.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:25):**  Just figured what does a procurement order for the Department of the Army look like?  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:30):**  And my jaw just hit the floor.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:31):**  Because of the size.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:32):**  The size was just, I mean, was indescribable.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:35):**  Like you'd have contracts that would have a single line item for 200,000 pounds of beef,  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:41):**  like one line item in one contract.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:43):**  And then it'd be like 150 contracts.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:46):**  And I would think about some of the farms that I consider to be like big boys in the  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:50):**  regenerative space.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:51):**  Like if you look at, I don't know, Will Harris' place, Joel Salatin's place, I think Will  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:54):**  Harris is probably way bigger than Salatin.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:56):**  But you know, if you look at these guys, like they're tiny.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:11:59):**  Even these big farms are tiny.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:00):**  Like you would have taken a poly phase, something like 25 years just to fill that one contract  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:06):**  and that one thing is like, this is impossible.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:09):**  So it really got me to think about what the actual size of the problem is when you're  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:13):**  looking directly at the market.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:14):**  Like this is one federal agency, one contract, one line item within that.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:19):**  It really made me think that we're a candle to the sun and we need to really do better.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:24):**  And I'm just not hearing, and this was the big thing, I did not hear any kind of critical  
**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:30):**  voices or peer review about the mathematical modeling around regenerative agriculture coming  
**[0:12:36-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:36):**  from regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:38):**  So that is really what kind of lit a fire under me was the fact that nobody was doing  
**[0:12:42-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:42):**  the work of figuring out how to do math.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:45):**  And that's from the consumer or in this case, the federal government side.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:48):**  If you look at, we need to do a lot better in terms of the amount of acres or hectares  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:53):**  we cover and does landscape management and does CO2 and carbon and water and everything  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:58):**  else.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:12:59):**  Like the sheer quantity is just enormous.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:02):**  Like what needs to be done.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:03):**  And it clearly shows that over the last 30, 40 years with mostly the organic movement  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:08):**  who has done a lot of good things, but just never scaled to the potential we all hoped  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:13):**  it had, or we needed to have.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:15):**  I think that's the, so it needs some other organizing principles and you are working  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:21):**  on a collective.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:22):**  So what is that vision for a much larger scale, but not a hundred thousand hectares, but a  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:28):**  much larger scale collective?  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:29):**  What does it mean when you talk about regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:31):**  I think everybody can imagine, we talk about a huge farm, monoculture, soy, GMO in Australia.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:37):**  You can imagine what that is.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:38):**  I mean, it's two guys with a tractor and a lot of drones, but what does it mean in terms  
**[0:13:43-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:43):**  of regenerative agriculture when you talk about scale?  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:46):**  So we're talking about putting together a mosaic of landscapes in our particular area,  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:50):**  which is the Western shore of the Chesapeake Bay.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:53):**  So we're talking about buying land for ourselves.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:13:55):**  We're talking about entering into agreements with departments and resources, park services  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:00):**  to have control over a hundred acres here, 200 acres there.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:04):**  We have landowners and nonprofits that control a surprising amount of land in our area.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:09):**  We've got at least 5,000 acres that we could have access to just from historic estates  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:14):**  that are looking for somebody to farm in a way that's not just corn, soy, wheat, canola.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:20):**  They want to do something different.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:21):**  They want food.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:23):**  I mean, they want something that goes to a market.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:24):**  I mean, you know, corn, soy, and canola, they're food in a sense.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:27):**  But so yeah, we're really thinking about, there's lots of bits of land everywhere.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:33):**  There's lots of people who want to farm and who would make good farmers, but who aren't  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:38):**  good entrepreneurs, who aren't people that want to deal with the non-farming parts of  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:42):**  things, but should still be able to get access to the landscape to do what they do, which  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:47):**  is what regenerative agriculture is supposed to do, build topsoil and improve biodiversity  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:52):**  and sequester carbon, do all the things that it's supposed to do.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:14:56):**  So the collective though really came out of the idea of equity in farming.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:00):**  It was how do you get people to farm in the first place and be able to make a career out  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:05):**  of it and not have it just be this thing that you do in your 20s when you can afford to  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:09):**  work for free and you think you're going to live forever and you're never going to get  
**[0:15:12-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:12):**  sick or want kids or retire or whatever.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:14):**  Like how can you come to the landscape and stay there?  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:19):**  And when I was talking about this with Sarah Mock, who at this point is almost like our  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:24):**  advancement slash chief operating officer type, her opinion, having visited all the  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:28):**  farms that she has and all the countries that she's gone to, she's basically said people  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:32):**  will not pay enough money for food for farm workers to make a livable wage.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:37):**  They just won't do it.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:38):**  The problem is just too politically intractable and there have to be other ways to compensate  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:44):**  people financially for the work that they do.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:47):**  And a lot of that solution revolved around then, okay, well what if we built a more asset  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:53):**  heavy kind of model, which farms tend to be anyway, asset heavy in terms of land, livestock,  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:15:59):**  you know, various things that actually appreciate in value.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:02):**  Why not bring people in and make them owners and then have their compensation be wealth  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:06):**  based rather than income based.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:07):**  So you get a bit of income, which is enough to live off anyway you get amazing food and  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:11):**  you're building wealth into a collective, into a company.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:14):**  Yeah, you're building wealth in the background.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:16):**  You're able to leverage it if you need to, but hopefully you don't.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:19):**  If you're farming in community and your housing is taken care of, your food is taken care  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:23):**  of, your insurance is taken care of, then ideally, hopefully you won't need that much  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:27):**  of a wage, but of course you should still be paid anyway.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:31):**  But the idea is that we find a way to pay you what the market will bear in terms of  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:34):**  income, but then do what all these other rich incumbent tractor farmers do, which is basically  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:40):**  just watch their land value appreciate.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:43):**  And that's the fundamental basis of their wealth and how they stay in farming.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:47):**  Despite all the bellyaching you hear about half of farmers have net losses every year  
**[0:16:51-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:51):**  and blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:52):**  I could talk about that forever and I won't.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:55):**  So the collective idea just came from that.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:16:57):**  And it also comes from an indigenous notion that land ownership is a really odd concept  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:04):**  that one person like draws lines around the part of-  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:07):**  Now it's mine.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:09):**  Right around the creation and just says, okay, this is mine and it's not anybody else's.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:13):**  It's like, what?  
**[0:17:14-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:14):**  I don't understand.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:15):**  Like there's no word for that in my language.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:18):**  Very few of the native languages that I know of can even conceptualize that concept in  
**[0:17:21-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:21):**  words.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:22):**  Which is something very recent.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:25):**  I mean here, this country is young, but it comes from just that idea that farming fundamentally,  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:31):**  at least for me and from my culture and tradition is an act of protecting creation.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:38):**  We here tend to consider ourselves to be land protectors and water protectors and food is  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:43):**  the byproduct.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:44):**  And that's kind of a concept that's been appropriated by regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:48):**  This idea I'm a soil farmer and the byproduct is grass fed beef.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:51):**  And I listened to this, I'm like, that sounds awfully familiar, but like sort of bastardized,  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:56):**  but okay.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:17:57):**  But when you're entered in that kind of a relational food system, which is what a lot  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:02):**  of indigenous people will refer to this as, you have to operate collectively.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:05):**  You have to operate as equals.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:07):**  There is no command and control.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:09):**  Everybody has equal access to this place, to the assets and the natural resources that  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:14):**  we draw our living from.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:16):**  So for us, the collective thing was just natural.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:19):**  It was a natural economic fit and it was a natural cultural fit.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:22):**  And for that, do you need to own all the land?  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:25):**  I mean, in this case, not because you mentioned we will be working with leased land for quite  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:30):**  a bit.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:31):**  And so how much of this vision, let's say you own yourself as a collective, not you  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:35):**  personally, and how much is it on leased land in terms of what leased land are you  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:39):**  actually helping to build up the soil, to build up the biodiversity, to build up life  
**[0:18:43-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:43):**  literally, but not on the land you actually own?  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:46):**  So how does that work with the wealth creation if you don't own the underlying message?  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:50):**  Well, it's that you own some and you rent and lease some.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:52):**  I mean, that's the way most farmers operate.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:54):**  They'll have their 100, 200, 300 acres and then they'll lease the thousand acres to somebody  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:18:59):**  else's.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:00):**  For our leases and our non-owned parts, we're going to be focusing more on institutional  
**[0:19:06-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:06):**  ownership because that ownership tends not to change hands.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:09):**  Yeah, that's going to be my next question.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:11):**  You need something long term there, otherwise why bother?  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:13):**  Yeah, you need to make sure that the land is somewhere where it's not just going to  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:16):**  go into private hands.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:17):**  It's going to wind up being developed after you've been there for 30 years, building soil  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:21):**  and doing what you had to do.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:22):**  And then next thing you know, it's McDonald's and McMansions and everything else.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:26):**  So you've got a lot of these institutions, NGO Estates, for example, that's just big  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:30):**  in Virginia because of our slaveholding history here.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:32):**  They've got all these old slaveholding plantations that still have two, three thousand acres  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:37):**  attached to them, but they've got a real guilt complex around it and they're trying to do  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:42):**  right.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:43):**  They've got conservation easements on everything.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:44):**  Stuff is never going to be developed.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:45):**  But it's also not going to be farmed.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:47):**  Yeah, it can be farmed.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:49):**  For now.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:51):**  And so that's the thing.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:52):**  We're able to come into these places again with the notion of we're going to protect  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:55):**  your landscapes here.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:56):**  We're going to do your forestry for you.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:57):**  We're going to do your pasture management.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:19:59):**  We're going to make sure that everything here is taken care of and we're going to happen  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:02):**  to bring in plants and animals to do that for us.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:05):**  We're going to encourage wild species.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:06):**  We're going to encourage game trails.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:07):**  We're going to create this long term hybrid system of domestic domesticated agriculture,  
**[0:20:13-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:13):**  intensive agriculture with more extensive indigenous focused kind of wild based agriculture.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:21):**  And so for these institutions, it's again, it's about protecting that landscape and making  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:24):**  sure that it's healthy and functional as a place that people want to come to visit and  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:29):**  get all the other ecosystem services besides food that people get from these places.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:35):**  And the fact that they are institutional, they're NGOs, they're not going anywhere,  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:40):**  makes us pretty comfortable with branching out and protecting these places.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:44):**  And even if they in the rare case if something would change and you're mostly, let's say,  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:51):**  some of the assets you can move in terms of animals, etc.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:53):**  I mean, it's not that you're building enormous stables that are full of pigs that are impossible  
**[0:20:58-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:58):**  to move.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:20:59):**  It's not that you have a lot of flexibility for many different reasons, but you also have  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:02):**  a bit of flexibility in the odd case of one in a hundred that actually does change at  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:06):**  some point.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:07):**  And with all these means actually something does go wrong.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:10):**  You could move out of that.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:11):**  And it's not ideal, but you have to flexibility.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:13):**  Yeah, that's the thing.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:15):**  If you've got let's say in our 10, 15 year vision, we own a thousand acres and we lease  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:21):**  like seven or eight thousand.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:22):**  How many people are in the collective then?  
**[0:21:24-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:24):**  Right now there's like eight of us.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:26):**  We're still small.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:27):**  In that vision, you're managing eight thousand acres.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:29):**  We're talking hundreds.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:30):**  A lot of people.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:31):**  You know, if you go to a city and interview, like I'd say, a hundred people, I bet you  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:37):**  if five of them would say, yeah, I think I'd like a farm for a living.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:41):**  And out of those, maybe like a half a person would actually be able to do it.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:46):**  But in this case, do it is interesting because what you mentioned before is obviously this  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:51):**  sort of jack of all trades that both is a great farmland manager, is a great chicken  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:21:57):**  processor or processor in general, is a great accountant and is a great trade sales manager.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:02):**  But in this collective that will be separated.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:04):**  And so actually it is very specific here.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:06):**  It's not managing a full farm on eight thousand acres.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:10):**  Yeah, that's the idea is that when you have a collective and you have hundreds of people  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:14):**  whose talent you can draw from, not everybody has to be an entrepreneur.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:18):**  One person can just be a really good seed keeper.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:21):**  And that's the thing that they do.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:22):**  And that's the service they provide.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:23):**  Somebody else can be an accountant.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:25):**  Somebody else can be a livestock manager.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:27):**  Somebody else can want to deal with the bison jumping over the six foot fence.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:31):**  People will be able to specialize.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:33):**  And that's the idea is that you'll be able to draw in so much more talent, so many more  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:38):**  people who want to do this work, but can't do all the work because we don't require that  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:43):**  of any other industry except for startups.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:45):**  You know, yeah, but they're meant to grow and to get people to do things.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:49):**  I mean, after a while, if you didn't hire your CFO and you look at them, where?  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:53):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:54):**  But we kind of have to get out of that idea that farms are supposed to stay in this startup  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:22:58):**  phase like forever, with this one person being that every man or every woman just interminably.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:04):**  But yeah, going back to your initial question, it's just, you know, that large landscape  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:08):**  goes hand in hand with having more and more people involved in that landscape.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:11):**  You want people on the ground.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:13):**  You want those farmers in those communities growing food for those communities.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:17):**  You don't want somebody in Brazil making decisions about what's going on with the food system  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:22):**  in Texas, because people in Brazil don't know what's going on in Texas.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:25):**  It's how you want it with supply chain issues that we had with COVID, you know, with empty  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:29):**  supermarket shelves and really tight supply chains and all this stuff.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:32):**  But getting to that scale and operating on those thousands of acres, it just comes with  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:36):**  so many benefits in terms of the number of people that can come in, the amount of acreage  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:41):**  that you can restore, actually making a measurable ecological impact as opposed to just doing  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:46):**  your, you know, having your 50 perfect acres.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:48):**  A little piece of paradise.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:52):**  I mean, it's like the parallels to COVID are ridiculous.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:53):**  It's like having one person wearing a mask while everybody else surrounding them isn't.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:56):**  It's just coughing all over everything.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:23:58):**  It's like, it's not how you create a system.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:01):**  It needs to be bigger.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:02):**  And what does it do for price?  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:04):**  Because that's what Sarah came back with from her global travel.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:08):**  Like, this is not going to be sustained.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:10):**  I mean, consumers are not going to pay enough to pay living wages.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:13):**  In this case, scalability helps, economies of scale help with that.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:18):**  What is your calculation there in terms of, because you're not at that scale yet, but  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:22):**  what is your vision there?  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:23):**  That's the thing.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:24):**  I haven't done exact calculations in terms of like what the price comes down to, but  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:28):**  I know it comes down just because you're operating.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:30):**  That 20%.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:32):**  I mean, that 20% gets to go away, you know, in theory, but when you're leveraging economies  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:36):**  of scale, when you're able to actually control your buying relationships really well, when  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:39):**  you're able to vertically integrate so you're not paying markup at every single point in  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:44):**  the food value chain, that's all stuff that can come out.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:47):**  I don't know if you're ever going to get down to like Walmart prices doing regenerative  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:51):**  agriculture because-  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:52):**  But do you have to?  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:53):**  I mean, yes and no.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:55):**  People are definitely price sensitive.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:24:57):**  They absolutely are, but they're not as price sensitive as people tend to think.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:02):**  A lot of access to food in my own experience is not so much around the cost of food, but  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:08):**  around the cost of being able to prepare food.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:11):**  A pork chop might cost like $10 or something like that, but you got to have pots, you got  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:16):**  to have pans, you got to have time to clean, you got to have time to shop, you got to have  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:19):**  time to thaw the pork chop, season the pork chop, cook the pork chop, eat the pork chop,  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:24):**  wash your dishes when you're done, put the stuff away.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:26):**  You got to have refrigeration for the leftovers.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:28):**  People who haven't been poor don't understand that there are people who will not turn on  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:33):**  their hot water heater because it's too expensive.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:35):**  So how does this help with that?  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:37):**  When you talk about processing, does that mean getting it to a level where you can simply  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:41):**  microwave it and eat it in that container as well?  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:44):**  What is your vision to make it accessible, even if price is maybe not the most important  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:48):**  thing, but the total cost actually is an important thing.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:51):**  Well, here's the thing I'll push back on a little bit is that people tend to expect farming  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:56):**  to bridge that whole gap.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:25:58):**  I think agriculture can do a part.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:00):**  I think regenerative agriculture can do some things to make itself more efficient, lower  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:03):**  its prices a bit.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:05):**  But there's going to be part of that gap that has to be addressed by wider society.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:10):**  There's only so much that farming can do itself to address things like inequality, to address  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:17):**  the fact that people have to work a regular full-time job and then two jobs in the gig  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:21):**  economy in order to make ends meet.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:24):**  Farming can't really solve those problems.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:27):**  What farming can do is create an environment that we can live in, that we can live with,  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:31):**  that can help solve climate change, that can bring the price of things down, that can make  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:34):**  food more healthy.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:36):**  We can do some work to make food more accessible in more places by, for example, getting rid  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:41):**  of this whole, I don't know, I'm going to get a lot of trouble saying this, but I think  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:44):**  farmers markets are kind of ridiculous.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:46):**  I will link to an interesting article you wrote about the calculation.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:50):**  The fact that you drive there with a lot of produce, I mean, it depends.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:53):**  Obviously, I know a number of farmers that are using regenerative practices in grain.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:56):**  I mean, they don't know the farmers market.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:26:58):**  They never go there because that doesn't make any sense because you're not going there with  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:01):**  six tons of grain.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:02):**  But let's say you're selling your produce and the amount of waste, inefficiency, time  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:07):**  of not selling previously and not just dropping off, like they're summer during now in mostly  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:12):**  Rico rings in the Nordics, like they drop X thousand in an hour because everything is  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:16):**  pre-sold and it makes so much sense.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:19):**  But yeah, it's not that interacting, which is great as well, but it has such a big cost  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:24):**  on a farmer that already does 80 plus hours a week and is over, work's probably burned  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:29):**  out and relationship is exploding.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:32):**  It just doesn't make sense.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:33):**  It's never going to compete with the supermarket.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:35):**  And it's cute and nice and it's an experience, but yeah, I'm going to get in trouble for  
**[0:27:39-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:39):**  this as well.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:40):**  But it just doesn't make sense on so many levels.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:42):**  Yeah, it's, I mean, it has a place.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:44):**  It is nice that there's somewhere you can go and interact with your farmer and have  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:48):**  that connection.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:49):**  But the fact that, you know, what percentage of people have access to that, you know, and  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:54):**  when you're, and it's fine for that to exist.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:27:56):**  But when your whole shtick is we're saving the world, we're doing the right thing.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:00):**  This is the future, blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:02):**  And it's like, no, no, it's not.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:04):**  Not if you have a full time job and you need to do two gig economy jobs just to make ends  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:09):**  meet.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:10):**  You're not going to go on Saturday morning to the farmer's market.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:11):**  No, not at all.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:12):**  Even if you had the money, I mean, you don't have the time.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:14):**  Exactly.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:15):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:16):**  Like even if you have the money, there's so many other pieces that don't that you have  
**[0:28:19-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:19):**  to run through.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:20):**  And most people and an increasing number of people aren't going to make it.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:25):**  And so there's only so much you can do, obviously in terms of price.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:28):**  And hopefully at some point, I mean, society, all of us have created this system of farming,  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:33):**  some more than others, and all of us have to contribute as consumers, but also as investors.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:38):**  So let's switch gears a bit in terms of the investment side, because I've heard you say  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:42):**  on multiple places, investing is key, not just being the consumer here, but also putting  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:48):**  your dollars, euros, yens, et cetera, to work.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:51):**  For this vision, you are in a very interesting place at the moment because you are, this  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:28:54):**  is not investment advice, but you are taking your relatively small scale farm to this much  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:00):**  larger vision that you painted, obviously with a number of steps in between.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:04):**  Where are you now?  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:05):**  What are you doing at the moment in terms of fundraising and how is that going?  
**[0:29:10-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:10):**  It's gone shockingly well to the point where-  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:13):**  Which is good to hear.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:16):**  I mean, we raised way more money, way faster than we thought we would.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:19):**  We offered an initial kind of a raise to hit our phase one for buying a small base of land  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:25):**  so that we had some kind of land tenure that was better than five, six year leases that  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:29):**  we have now.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:30):**  So to buy a seed cattle herds, we can start building that asset.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:34):**  Livestock herds are an incredible way to build wealth.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:36):**  And just getting some efficiencies done on the farm and expanding our cold storage, stuff  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:40):**  like that.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:41):**  Just being able to really expand our capacity to meet more consumer demand.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:44):**  Would that be your series A if we stay in the startup or your seed?  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:48):**  What do you compare that to?  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:50):**  I don't know the startup parlance very well.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:52):**  I wasn't in that part of the tech world.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:29:55):**  I was in the government consulting, writing evil software for evil organizations part  
**[0:30:01-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:01):**  of it.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:02):**  But you have a strong market for your current farm.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:06):**  You need a number of infrastructure in place and a number of things to start that would  
**[0:30:10-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:10):**  take way too long if you do it on cash flow.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:12):**  Basically, that's the spiel now.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:15):**  The margins aren't terrible.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:16):**  It's an operating scale we need to.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:18):**  You need infusions of money.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:20):**  You need impact capital.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:21):**  You need people willing to give you fairly large loans.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:24):**  And there's lots of vehicles for doing that.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:26):**  But we were able to raise something like 300,000 or so in like 30 days.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:31):**  And I'm not going to lie, we weren't trying that hard.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:34):**  I wrote a brief in a pitch deck and put it out there and figured we'd maybe get some  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:38):**  attention.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:39):**  But just the amount of...  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:40):**  And this investment is equity, it's loan.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:42):**  What is the structure?  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:43):**  It came out to be something like a little less than a third in GIFs and the balance  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:47):**  in short term in the grand scheme of things, loans like five-year loans with 3.5% lump  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:53):**  sum at the end.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:54):**  Really just impact loans, hardly any return at all.  
**[0:30:57-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:57):**  You don't lose money on interest.  
**[0:30:58-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:58):**  Impact first.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:30:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:00):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:01):**  So yeah, people really connected with this mission that I think investors, I think people  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:07):**  in general, consumers, everybody, they're looking for somebody to tell them the truth  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:11):**  about agriculture and the truth about environmentalism and agriculture and not just be trying to  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:16):**  sell them the next product.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:18):**  And I feel like in a lot of ways, regenerative agriculture has kind of descended into a marketing  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:24):**  arm for grass-fed beef in a lot of ways.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:28):**  It's very disappointing to kind of watch happen in real time.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:31):**  There's just been a great response to a non-traditional voice, which means someone who's indigenous,  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:37):**  not white, coming in from outside of agriculture, who's a cultural outsider of this thing, who  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:42):**  will look at this from-  
**[0:31:43-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:43):**  An engineer as well.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:47):**  I mean, to have this objective problem-solving oriented view toward our food and agriculture  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:51):**  and environmental systems, I think is something that people really connect with.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:31:55):**  And to have somebody who's willing to push back against the, be small, or you run around  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:00):**  your nuclear family, somebody who's willing to integrate and get big and really just take  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:05):**  the fight to traditional agribusiness, because we've really shied away from just putting  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:11):**  the gloves on and saying, ADM, hey, let's box.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:14):**  Let's see who wins.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:16):**  Let's try to get to a point where we can compete with them.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:19):**  And I think people just responded to the idea that there could be an actual strategy around,  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:24):**  okay, how are we actually going to compete with these guys?  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:26):**  How are we actually going to scale up?  
**[0:32:29-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:29):**  What does this end result look like?  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:31):**  Instead of this pie in the sky motion that lots and lots and lots of small regenerative  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:36):**  farmers are going to come from the ether somewhere.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:39):**  They fall out of the sky, I heard.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:40):**  I mean, at this point, they're going to have to.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:43):**  So when, I mean, I know a lot of investors and people working in the space that are listening  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:49):**  to this that are super enthusiastic about soil, that have read some of the books, have  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:53):**  visited some of these farms that somehow against all odds and with a lot of luck, either because  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:32:58):**  of inheritance, et cetera, have made some kind of success.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:01):**  They want to invest in this space without giving investment advice.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:04):**  They can of course look at the proposal you've out there.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:06):**  But what would you as an outsider insider tell somebody who's in Australia or who's  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:11):**  in Italy or who's in Florida?  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:14):**  It says, okay, I want to be part of building something like this.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:18):**  I can invest.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:19):**  What should they look out for?  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:21):**  Where should they go and listen and basically at some point maybe invest?  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:26):**  So given the title of this podcast, investing in regenerative agriculture, I'm going to  
**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:30):**  say investors should look outside of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:33):**  And what I mean by that is that regenerative agriculture has turned into a very monolithic  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:40):**  industry of people of extraordinarily similar backgrounds looking at a problem in the exact  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:46):**  same way.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:47):**  And it's become a little bit problematic because you've got some issues with basic scientific  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:53):**  literacy.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:54):**  You have some issues with certain studies about things like carbon sequestration being  
**[0:33:59-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:33:59):**  oversold.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:00):**  There's a lot of promise in what regenerative agriculture offers in terms of increasing  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:04):**  biodiversity, in terms of the ability to improve degraded soils and in sequestered  
**[0:34:10-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:10):**  carbon in degraded soils.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:12):**  But a lot of it's being oversold by a lot of attackers.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:14):**  A lot of people are using regenerative agriculture to argue, for example, that the United States  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:19):**  can still have a hundred million strong beef cattle herd, which even as a guy who loves  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:25):**  cattle, I graze cattle, I rotate cattle, I love cattle.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:28):**  But no, the math doesn't work.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:32):**  I've done the math, I've written about the math and got yelled at about it, but nobody  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:35):**  was able to actually refute the math.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:36):**  I just got yelled at for not being cool.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:39):**  Saying basically, unless we ask that much harder question, like how much beef are we  
**[0:34:43-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:43):**  actually eating or any other very intensive protein, how do we need to change our diets?  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:50):**  How do we need to change much more of our system?  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:53):**  It's not enough just to switch, let's switch everything to grass fat, holistic grazed,  
**[0:34:56-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:56):**  et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:34:58-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:58):**  We won't fix it.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:34:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:00):**  And I think you just have to be careful if you're an investor or even a consumer, when  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:03):**  you've got a problem that's as complicated as food, because food is wrapped up in every  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:08):**  fundamental issue that like, especially in the United States, food is wrapped up.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:11):**  It's everywhere.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:12):**  I don't remember who said it.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:13):**  I think it was maybe Dan Barr, wasn't it?  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:15):**  Like it's one of these, I don't remember it was him, one of these carpets where if you  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:19):**  pull one string, it's attached to every single other thing in the whole, like you cannot  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:24):**  just say, okay, this is a solution, grass-fed beef or vegan burgers or lupine or I mean  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:30):**  seaweed or anything.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:33):**  Like the moment it becomes a single solution, you know somebody didn't ask enough questions  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:38):**  because it cannot be.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:40):**  That's what it boils down to.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:41):**  There's not going to be any simple solutions.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:42):**  And when people are offering simple solutions to food that's tied up in environmentalism,  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:48):**  racism, climate change, land use change, you know, all these different things.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:52):**  No, the solution is usually going to be multifaceted and extraordinarily unsatisfying.  
**[0:35:58-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:58):**  And that's okay.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:35:59):**  You know, so what should investors do?  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:02):**  What investors really should do is specifically seek out voices from people who have been  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:08):**  systematically excluded from agriculture.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:11):**  And here's the reason why.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:13):**  Our whole, when I was looking at the ITM framework that you sent me, it really caught me.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:17):**  Next question will be about that.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:19):**  It really caused me to think about, okay, what is the actual problem that we're trying  
**[0:36:22-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:22):**  to solve?  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:23):**  Like, you know, in one sentence, what's the problem and what's the solution we're trying  
**[0:36:26-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:26):**  to come up with?  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:27):**  And in a sentence, it's create a competitive alternative to traditional agriculture and  
**[0:36:32-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:32):**  agribusiness.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:33):**  Like that's the fundamental thing we have to solve.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:35):**  You've got an extractive agriculture and agribusiness system.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:38):**  We need to find a way to compete with it in a way that is regenerative and restorative  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:42):**  and restores inclusive relationships between all the different forms of life on this planet  
**[0:36:48-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:48):**  that depend on each other.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:50):**  And one of the first things, you know, before we even get to like integration scale and  
**[0:36:55-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:55):**  like changing who we're accountable to, being accountable to the people in the collective  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:36:59):**  as opposed to stockholders who only care about the next quarter's returns or whatever.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:04):**  The first thing I put in there was bringing in people of color and people from other marginalized  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:09):**  communities for two reasons.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:12):**  One is because these are people who have had to spend their lifetimes and generations adapting  
**[0:37:18-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:18):**  to impossible conditions.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:20):**  Like these are the people who can look at a problem like food and say, you know what?  
**[0:37:24-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:24):**  I've lived under racial oppression.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:26):**  I've lived under gender oppression.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:27):**  I've lived under trans and queer oppression.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:29):**  I kind of know how to dance around big problems.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:31):**  They spent their whole lives doing it, developing patterns for solving hard problems.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:36):**  You want these people in the room.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:38):**  Like there's a reason that organizations like Google would hire brain surgeons and neurologists  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:42):**  to help set up their server networks because their brains were wired for this particular  
**[0:37:46-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:46):**  problem set.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:49):**  People of color and queer people and trans people, like people who have lived their lives  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:52):**  on the outside, they have more practice solving what feels like impossible problems just as  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:37:58):**  a part of their day-to-day lives.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:00):**  So those are people you absolutely have to have in the conversation.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:03):**  When you have people like that who are devoted to changing the food system, they need to  
**[0:38:08-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:08):**  be listened to.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:09):**  Right now, they're just not.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:11):**  Nobody's giving them the mic.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:12):**  This mic that I have right now is a rare mic that is given out to people of my background.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:17):**  I hope not the last.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:18):**  If you go to conferences, no, it's white.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:21):**  It's all the same background.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:23):**  There's nothing wrong with being white.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:24):**  I have to tell the truth.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:25):**  It's okay to be white.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:26):**  Yeah, but if it's only, it becomes...  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:30):**  It's like if you grow a cornfield that's only corn, you're going to have problems and very  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:35):**  specific diseases that sprout out of having this monoculture.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:39):**  These can exist in society as well and within industries, and right now, that's what we've  
**[0:38:44-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:44):**  got.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:45):**  So if you're an investor who really wants to make that impact and really hit that ITM  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:47):**  framework, especially when it comes to the neglectedness part of it and the tractability  
**[0:38:51-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:51):**  part of it, your dollars will go a really long way when they're invested in people who  
**[0:38:57-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:38:57):**  look like me and look like people that aren't usually in those rooms because you'd be surprised  
**[0:39:03-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:03):**  how much they can do with so little because these are people who are used to having to  
**[0:39:07-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:07):**  do twice as good with half as much.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:10):**  Just to give a bit of background in why I'm asking this question, actually you're answering  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:15):**  before I'm asking, which is perfect, but ITM is a framework on importance, the I, the tractability.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:20):**  So is it how solvable is the problem and the neglectedness, which I always struggle with,  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:25):**  but how neglected is this area?  
**[0:39:28-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:28):**  And it comes from effective altruism.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:29):**  If we want to know more about it, I'll put it in the show notes below and it really forces  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:33):**  people to...  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:35):**  We all have limited resources, could be money, could be time, could be attention, probably  
**[0:39:38-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:38):**  all three and many others.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:40):**  What should you be working on and where can you have the most impact in terms of importance?  
**[0:39:45-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:45):**  Is this a big problem?  
**[0:39:46-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:46):**  If we would solve this problem, would that really help?  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:49):**  In this case, fixing agriculture, definitely a big problem and a huge potential.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:54):**  Is it solvable?  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:39:55):**  That's a big question, but seems to be that it's solvable and tractable and we can trace  
**[0:40:00-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:00):**  the steps.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:01):**  It's not that we have to wait for nuclear fusion another 15 years.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:05):**  This is something that we sort of know how to do and probably we'll get better at.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:09):**  And is it neglected?  
**[0:40:10-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:10):**  And in this case, what you're pointing out, your dollars, your investments, your resources,  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:13):**  your time will go way further, like multiple X further if you focus on these pieces that  
**[0:40:19-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:19):**  are completely ignored.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:21):**  If you look at the books that are out there, and I'm not going to ask you the question,  
**[0:40:24-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:24):**  which book should you read simply because they're not there and which interviews, which  
**[0:40:27-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:27):**  movies should you watch, et cetera, et cetera, simply because this whole area of indigenous  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:33):**  and non-white farmers communities has been almost completely ignored, which is something  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:38):**  that I don't think many people, at least many people I know are very aware of.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:42):**  And I think calling that out is very important and making sure we stop ignoring that is very  
**[0:40:47-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:47):**  important as well.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:48):**  But making sure we put money to work because at the end it's nice if we don't ignore you  
**[0:40:51-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:51):**  anymore and we put your podcast, et cetera.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:53):**  But as long as we don't really invest in it as well, these collectives don't go anywhere.  
**[0:40:57-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:57):**  Yeah, yeah, I agree.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:40:58):**  I mean, and the neglected is part of it is just when we think about regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:41:03-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:03):**  especially its insistence on the importance of biodiversity, no one is better at managing  
**[0:41:10-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:10):**  biodiversity than indigenous people.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:11):**  I mean, National Geographic came out with something, I think a little over a year ago  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:15):**  that found out that indigenous people make up 5% of the global population or something  
**[0:41:19-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:19):**  like that and are protecting 80% of the remaining biodiversity on the planet.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:25):**  So it's like, I don't know how you can have a serious discussion about biodiversity without  
**[0:41:30-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:30):**  including them on the table.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:32):**  Not just at the table, they should be mostly indigenous people at the table with support  
**[0:41:36-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:36):**  people.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:37):**  If you want to solve a physics problem, you probably want a room full of physicists.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:41):**  You've got a biodiversity problem, you probably want to want to talk to the people that are  
**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:44):**  doing it, that are doing the work, they're getting it done, that are demonstrably protecting  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:49):**  what's left on this planet to be protected.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:51):**  So yeah, it's, again, just the amount that we could do with, you know, you mentioned  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:41:56):**  Dan Barber just a minute ago, and I just remember that I think they started stone barns or something  
**[0:42:00-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:42:00):**  with like $30 million or something like that.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:42:03):**  And the indigenous community has some issues with Dan and stone barns and some of the stuff  
**[0:42:08-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:42:08):**  they're doing.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:42:09):**  But I'm just like, if I could get half of $30 million, just half the amount of change  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:42:16):**  in people that I would be able to feed and bring onto the landscape and the change that  
**[0:42:21-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:42:21):**  we could rend in the landscape would just be so overwhelmingly incredible.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:42:27):**  And for literally half the cost of what it's taken to create stone barns, which, as lovely  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:42:32):**  as it is, I mean, I know a lot of people at stone barns, people who I respect a lot, who  
**[0:42:36-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:42:36):**  manage some of their programs there, but it's a jewel box in New England for rich people.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:42:44):**  Where's the impact?  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:42:45):**  It's like, give me a fraction of what you got.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:42:49):**  And the reason I say that is because there's a lot of me's out there who could take these  
**[0:42:54-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:42:54):**  millions of dollars that are being sent to these really shiny kind of objects.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:42:59):**  But if you give it to these people who are kind of operating in the shadows, who are  
**[0:43:04-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:43:04):**  hustling and making it work with what little bit they've got, you give somebody like them,  
**[0:43:11-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:43:11):**  you give somebody like me just like 1 million, half a million or whatever, the amount of  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:43:17):**  change you will get for your dollars is so much far and away better than what you could  
**[0:43:22-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:43:22):**  invest in right now.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:43:24):**  And to switch the discussion there, what if you'll be in charge of a $1 billion?  
**[0:43:28-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:43:28):**  So that's a B, so nine zeros, which I'm asking that question specifically because I meet  
**[0:43:33-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:43:33):**  a lot of farmers and land stewards who are not used to thinking those numbers or thinking  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:43:39):**  those zeros, let's say.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:43:40):**  And I really want, because the money is coming in a sense that there's a lot of pressure  
**[0:43:46-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:43:46):**  for larger investors, institutional investors, family offices to get into the space and the  
**[0:43:50-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:43:50):**  retail is a whole different discussion.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:43:51):**  I mean, I think there's a lot of interest.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:43:53):**  You see that now a lot of people want to do things, but I think we completely miss the  
**[0:43:57-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:43:57):**  infrastructure to put that kind of money to work.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:00):**  So as somebody that's in the space that is an engineer, but it's also very active, what  
**[0:44:04-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:04):**  would you do if tomorrow morning you wake up and you have an investment fund, but you  
**[0:44:08-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:08):**  could be completely free to how to use it, but it has to be invested of a billion dollars.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:14):**  After I stopped weeping tears of joy, probably the first thing I do is one of the really  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:20):**  interesting things that's happened, and this is going to sound like I'm going off on a  
**[0:44:23-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:23):**  tangent, but I promise I'm not.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:24):**  One of the things that's happened in the wake of the killing of George Floyd and all the  
**[0:44:28-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:28):**  protests that have come out from that is people of color, especially who are trying to do  
**[0:44:33-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:33):**  projects on the landscape have gotten a lot of visibility and are losing a lot of money,  
**[0:44:40-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:40):**  but they're disconnected.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:41):**  You mean from each other or from?  
**[0:44:43-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:43):**  From each other.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:45):**  You've got one farmer here in New York.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:46):**  You've got a couple starting a thing over in California.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:49):**  You got somebody doing pigs in Texas.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:50):**  You got somebody doing indigenous heirloom seed stock up near Canada somewhere.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:55):**  You have all these efforts, a lot of them like clustered near each other, but operating  
**[0:44:58-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:44:58):**  independently of one another.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:45:00):**  If I had a billion dollars to throw out there, I would absolutely incentivize all of these  
**[0:45:05-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:45:05):**  guys who are close to each other to collectivize.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:45:07):**  I'll tell them, look, you were able to raise 10 grand.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:45:10):**  If you partner with the 20 farmers that are in your area and I will help hook you up,  
**[0:45:15-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:45:15):**  I'll give you $3 million each so that you all can actually create a regional food system  
**[0:45:19-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:45:19):**  in the area that you're at so that you can buy the things that you need in bulk so that  
**[0:45:24-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:45:24):**  you can get your prices down, so you guys can work together so you're not all working  
**[0:45:28-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:45:28):**  60, 70, 80 hours a week so you can have quality of life so you can still be farming when you're  
**[0:45:33-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:45:33):**  60.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:45:34):**  There are so many, so many clusters of these individuals who are operating all over, at  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:45:40):**  least the United States, operating all over this part of the country who if they would  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:45:44):**  just be able to see each other and have the mechanisms to combine their land, combine  
**[0:45:49-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:45:49):**  their resources, combine their labor, combine their equipment, their markets, their sourcing,  
**[0:45:55-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:45:55):**  their vendors, all of that stuff could be so overwhelmingly powerful.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:00):**  I think it would topple traditional agriculture and agribusiness so quickly, I don't know  
**[0:46:07-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:07):**  if they'd even see it coming, even with just a billion dollars.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:10):**  Because a billion dollars is like a rounding error when it comes to agriculture, but it's  
**[0:46:13-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:13):**  still for us-  
**[0:46:14-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:14):**  It's nothing and it's a lot.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:16):**  Exactly.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:17):**  For us, a billion dollars going into BIPOC farming collectives that are specifically  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:21):**  geared toward operating at scale.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:22):**  Sorry, what kind of farming collectives?  
**[0:46:24-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:24):**  Like indigenous people of color.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:26):**  That's a, sorry, that's kind of a term used in the US a lot to describe all the minorities  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:30):**  all at once.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:31):**  Which is sort of weird, but yeah.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:33):**  It takes some getting used to, definitely.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:36):**  I mean, to have a billion dollars go to people who right now effectively have nothing and  
**[0:46:40-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:40):**  are still having a fairly incredible and outsized impact given how small we are.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:46):**  Imagine if they could.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:48):**  Imagine the leverage that a billion dollars would give those people.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:52):**  If you would like to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and  
**[0:46:56-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:46:56):**  agriculture, find our video course on investing in regenerativeagriculture.com.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:03):**  This course will teach you to understand the opportunities to get to know the main players,  
**[0:47:07-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:07):**  to learn about the main trends and how to evaluate a new investment opportunity.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:11):**  Like what kind of questions to ask.

**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:19):**  The other thing I would invest it in honestly is pretty much every, especially indigenous  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:24):**  people, seed stock keeper, seed keeper, and stock breeder.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:29):**  Because I think one of the biggest and most unspoken threats to the food system globally  
**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:34):**  is the reduction in the diversity of our wild stocks and our seed stocks.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:38):**  We've got climate change coming.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:40):**  We need more species that are more adaptive, but we've got genetic bottlenecking happening  
**[0:47:44-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:44):**  in both livestock and seeds that's happening at a rate that should scare the socks off  
**[0:47:48-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:48):**  of everyone.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:50):**  But it's so technical that nobody really cares.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:54):**  It's really hard to say, hey, you should really care about the reduction of genetic diversity  
**[0:47:57-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:57):**  within domesticated seeds.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:47:59):**  Everybody just goes to sleep.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:00):**  I go to sleep thinking about it.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:02):**  But it's incredibly important.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:03):**  And most of the people who I know who are keeping these rare, especially things like  
**[0:48:09-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:09):**  corn, shashquim, beans, squash, kind of our traditional crops that are engineered by thousands  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:17):**  of years of hybridization to do well in different environments, from the high desert to rainforest  
**[0:48:22-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:22):**  everywhere else.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:23):**  The people who are keeping them are guys that are keeping their stuff in a rubber shed outside,  
**[0:48:29-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:29):**  a $100 rubber shed.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:30):**  And they'll be sitting on a little Ziploc bag that has the last of some ancient variety  
**[0:48:37-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:37):**  of corn, where if it disappears, that's the last one that can grow at this latitude in  
**[0:48:40-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:40):**  the desert in this part of Arizona.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:42):**  It's nuts how underfunded these people are, given how important the work is they're doing.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:47):**  So I think AFRRA was done collectivizing as much of agriculture around the country as  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:53):**  I could, just all the money these seed keepers need to do what they need to do and restore  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:48:57):**  these seed stocks and compete with just the incredible concentration of power that comes  
**[0:49:03-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:03):**  with genetic engineering.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:05):**  And taking away your powers as an investor with a billion dollars, if there was one thing  
**[0:49:09-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:09):**  you could change in agriculture.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:10):**  So you have a magic wand now and there's one thing you can change tomorrow morning.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:14):**  It sounds a bit like a fairy tale, but what would that be?  
**[0:49:17-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:17):**  I would end farm welfare in the United States as we know it.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:21):**  I would end the farm welfare there, encourage farmers to treat their operations as something  
**[0:49:25-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:25):**  other than a business, which is fundamentally what happens.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:28):**  It's why we have so many grains.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:29):**  It's why we're farming more land than we need to.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:31):**  And we have these giant surpluses that our cheap food system is based on is because farmers  
**[0:49:36-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:36):**  do not have to care about the consumer.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:39):**  They just have to grow X amount and they're going to make X amount based on what the market  
**[0:49:42-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:42):**  has.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:43):**  And if the market doesn't make that amount, they're going to get a direct payment.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:45):**  They're going to get their crop insurance or some of these guys aren't going to be,  
**[0:49:48-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:48):**  they're going to be paid not to farm.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:50):**  Like you're going to get paid by CRP, by conservation reserve programs to like just leave your fields  
**[0:49:54-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:54):**  fallow.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:55):**  I'm like, are you freaking serious?  
**[0:49:56-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:49:56):**  What other industry does that except for maybe like defense in the United States?  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:00):**  So yeah, if I could wave a magic wand, CRP, CI and direct payments go away tomorrow.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:05):**  I heard similar ones before and I think it's very similar to some of the situations in  
**[0:50:09-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:09):**  Europe as well.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:10):**  I mean, some other countries obviously have very different systems, but it's such a tortuous  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:14):**  and non, I mean, very difficult to compete with someone obviously that's paid not to  
**[0:50:19-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:19):**  farm or that's paid to farm every little inch of they can find, but farming a product that  
**[0:50:24-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:24):**  nobody actually will buy and just goes into your commodity system and ends up in your  
**[0:50:28-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:28):**  petrol car or something like that.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:30):**  It goes in your car or it goes in cows.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:33):**  It's usually destined for one of those two places.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:35):**  And I want to be conscious of your time as well, Chris.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:38):**  And I don't think it's the last time.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:39):**  I hope it's not the last time we talk because I think there's a lot to follow here to see  
**[0:50:43-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:43):**  how the collective gets funded first of all, and then gets going further than it already  
**[0:50:48-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:48):**  has been.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:49):**  What, I mean, there are many things I think, but if you had to pick one thing, I like to  
**[0:50:52-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:52):**  ask the question that Jon Kemp asked about general extractive agriculture, but I like  
**[0:50:58-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:50:58):**  to ask it about region ag.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:00):**  What do you believe to be true about region ag that others don't believe to be true?  
**[0:51:03-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:03):**  You've mentioned a number of them.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:04):**  What's the top one that you think, okay, if that could, that myth could go away, that  
**[0:51:08-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:08):**  would be amazing.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:09):**  It's kind of hard to distill that in one thing, but I'll say kind of what I've said before.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:15):**  Regenerative agriculture has become kind of dangerous.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:20):**  It's become horrific.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:21):**  It's started to orient itself around a specific product and a specific diet.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:26):**  Not so much around land protection anymore, not so much around soil building anymore.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:31):**  And what I see, and this is just my opinion as one guy, I see regenerative agriculture  
**[0:51:37-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:37):**  quickly turning into a device that protects a very specific type of farmer.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:43):**  There's an extraordinary aversion to critical peer review in the industry.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:49):**  There's a lack of basic scientific literacy a lot of the time.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:53):**  And there's a very incestuous and dangerous tendency for experts within the industry to  
**[0:51:58-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:51:58):**  cite one another in a circle.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:00):**  There's very, there are very few people from the outside examining this thing, examining  
**[0:52:05-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:05):**  the premises and conclusions of regenerative agriculture and challenging those conclusions  
**[0:52:10-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:10):**  so that the movement can get better.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:12):**  Like the muscle is not flexing and it's causing it to atrophy, I believe.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:18):**  And I think all of that combined is hobbling the ability of the movement to maximize its  
**[0:52:22-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:22):**  impact because the change that regenerative agriculture can make is very real and very  
**[0:52:29-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:29):**  incredible.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:30):**  But right now the movement is not doing itself any favors by making itself composed of one  
**[0:52:36-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:36):**  very specific type of farmer and one very specific type of consumer.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:42):**  Regenerative agriculture needs to try harder.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:45):**  And I think a lot of people don't believe that.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:47):**  And with that, I think it's a perfect end of this podcast.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:50):**  I want to thank you so much for your time and I know you need to start packing a lot  
**[0:52:54-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:54):**  of chickens, so we'll let you go.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:56):**  And I hope it's not the last time we have you on the podcast.  
**[0:52:58-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:58):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:52:59):**  This has been a pleasure.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:53:00):**  I really appreciate the opportunity.

**[0:53:50-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:53:50):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:53:54-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:53:54):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:53:59-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:53:59):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:54:03):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:54:04-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:54:04):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:54:08):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:54:13-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:54:13):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:54:18):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:54:20-0:54:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:54:20):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:54:23-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:54:23):**  What to focus on with the podcast?

**[0:55:35-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:55:35):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:55:41-0:55:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:55:41):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:55:43):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:55:48-0:55:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:55:48):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:55:54-0:55:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:55:54):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:55:58-0:56:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:55:58):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:56:00):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:56:05-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:56:05):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:56:09):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:56:13-0:56:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:56:13):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:56:14-0:56:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:56:14):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:56:16):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:56:19):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:56:22):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:56:24):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/09/29/chris-newman#t=0:56:30):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

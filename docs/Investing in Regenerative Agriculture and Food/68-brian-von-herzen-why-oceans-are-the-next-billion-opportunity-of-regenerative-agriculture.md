### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:14):**  This interview is a deep dive literally into the world of marine permaculture and seaweed  and why the Regen-ag movement shouldn't stop at the shoreline but continues into our seas  and oceans.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:27):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if  the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:40-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:40):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:53):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small,  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  In March last year we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:09):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:20):**  For more information on the different tiers, benefits and how to become a member check  patreon.com slash regenerative agriculture or find the link below.  Thank you.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:30):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  Today I'm joined by Brian von Herzen, Executive Director of the Climate Foundation and the  original founder of the Marine Permaculture Movement.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:41):**  I'm very interested to dive deeper into something we haven't discussed too much, the seas, the  connection from the seas to the soils.  Welcome Brian.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:48):**  Oh, thank you.  Thanks John, it's a pleasure to be here.  And to start with a personal question, what brings you to this space?  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:56):**  What brings you to seaweed, soils, region ag, of all the other research topics, of all  the other topics you could have spent your life on?  Well nearly two decades ago we were doing some expeditions across Greenland in a small  
**[0:02:09-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:09):**  plane and we noticed the surface of Greenland was melting and it was a very small melt ponds  to begin with, but each year that we crossed the size of the melt ponds were increasing,  doubling in size.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:25):**  After a couple years they were calling them melt lakes and then by 2012 97% of the surface  of Greenland melted and we realized even in the early 2000s that we had to do something  sustainable to try to address this exponential increase in melting.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:41):**  And that led me to do a sabbatical in Woods Hall in studying algae biology and carbon  biogeochemistry and then beyond that to really consider how can we enlist life to help us  rebalance carbon in our seas and in our soils.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:59):**  And you work on a lot of different topics.  I'm definitely going to link your website and a lot of your talks below, but in this  case, this conversation I would like to focus on the finance side of things, the investor  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:11):**  side of things, because I know a lot of listeners will be very excited after, I hope at least  after this interview, so I hope we can give them some direction and some focus.  So I would like to ask a question on, basically you're mentioning the connection between the  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:25):**  mountains and the sea and I think it's something we focus a lot on the soil and on the land  side of things.  Why is that connection between the mountains and the sea so important?  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:34):**  The mountains help the sea and the sea helps the mountains, or I should say the soils.  So I just finished giving a talk here in Morocco where I was visiting with the government and  we met with some of the agriculture and some of the aquaculture groups here and agencies  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:50):**  and it was very interesting because I spoke about my home state of California where we've  studied the kelp forests and you know, there's a shifting baseline.  No one has a living memory of the kelp forests that were off the coast of California in the  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:05):**  mid 1800s.  But we went back and did the research to find the original U.S. Geodetic Survey maps from  1850s, 1860s, 1880s, which showed a river of a kelp a kilometer wide extending from  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:21):**  Point Concepcion, hundreds of kilometers all the way past the border with Mexico.  And this was a continuous river of kelp between 10 and 25 meters depth that was covering the  coastline and it was this incredible bounty of nature.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:36):**  Now what happened was in the early 1900s we had development of farming, urbanization,  but primarily the loss of soil and runoff that went into the sea because of standard  farming practices and that was exacerbated later.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:51):**  And between the silt and the nutrients, the visibility in the water dropped precipitously  and this actually choked off the juvenile kelp from growing from a depth of 25 meters  to the surface.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:02):**  So if they don't have enough sunlight they can't grow all the way to the surface.  If they can't grow they don't survive.  And so we lost the deep kelps and we lost some of the middle kelps and so now we only  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:11):**  have a small remnant of the forest that once was.  And so this is how our farming practices can affect the sea and the sea clarity.  And so if we do less runoff and more regenerative farming we can actually have a much clearer  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:25):**  ocean.  And conversely the seaweeds have this incredible input, a catalytic input almost, on the growth  of crops both as a soil amendment and also as a seaweed foliar biostimulant.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:38):**  And in several other ways, for example, as a feed supplement for ruminant livestock,  it can cut most of the methane of the enteric emissions of ruminant livestock.  So there's so many ways that the sea gives back to the farm and gives back to the soil  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:52):**  and I think it's a full circle, a circular value chain if you will.  And I mean there's so much to unpack there.  Let's start with, because I've seen and heard a number of farmers talk about seaweed on  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:04):**  their farm, so they basically bring seaweed which has been grown at the sea obviously  to their farm as a soil amendment as you mentioned.  Is that happening at scale and if not what would be necessary to really kick start that  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:18):**  part of the industry?  Which I think to farmers looks very interesting because it is that full circle of maybe some  of the old runoff that was captured by the seaweed and now no longer has runoff because  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:27):**  they're doing regenerative farming but they still need some of those input back basically  to kick start their system.  Is that something you see on a small scale and if so what would be necessary to really  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:37):**  scale that up?  There is small scale incorporation of kelp and seaweeds off the coast of California for  example and to some extent utilized in Australia permaculture as well where the kelps and the  
**[0:06:48-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:48):**  seaweeds provide micronutrients, they provide polysaccharides, growth stimulants, the natural  glibaryllins and auxins and cytokines that help plants grow exist in seaweed.  And so scientists and researchers have had a hard time isolating a single compound that  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:07):**  does it.  There seems to be a synergy between polysaccharides, beneficial proteins, plant growth regulation  and micronutrients that together have a transformative effect on the production of the soil.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:21):**  We've seen peer review literature citing to 11% increase in rice, 20% increase in vegetables,  40% increase in eggplants and one or two published studies showing 56% increase in yields on  soybeans and this is using seaweed foliar biostimulants.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:39):**  Now that's a very small application rate, it's only a few liters per acre or maybe four  liters per hectare but even at these very low rates there are significant yield increases  in agriculture.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:52):**  Then furthermore there's a notion of a soil amendment, the mulch, the compost and that  would be a larger application of solid seaweeds and as long as you can manage these very small  levels the salinity is not a factor and you can track it at larger levels as well and  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:08):**  I think those are key areas.  In terms of scale today, Ascofilum rockweed is harvested from Maine, from Canada, from  Iceland, even parts of Europe and has been used in relatively large quantity in I would  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:24):**  call them seaweed soil amendments and whatnot that are used a fair amount in commercial  and personal farms today.  That's a good starting point but this northern seaweed has different effects than the tropical  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:38):**  red seaweeds and the tropical brown seaweeds and even some of the kelps.  So I think that there are different types of seaweed and the right combination of seaweed  for particular plants is going to be a key opportunity to develop in the months and years  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:54):**  ahead.  So you would see a lot of opportunity in basically mixing and trying to find the right recipe  for the right type of crop or cropland basically to mix or to connect them better.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:09):**  Yes in particular what we're noticing is that seaweed does a fantastic job of increasing  the stress resistance of the plants and that includes resistance to heat, resistance to  drought and resistance to disease.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:24):**  And you know all crops have some amount of stress but when we get into a global warming  situation the amount of heat stress and the amount of drought becomes severe and the seaweeds  have been able to confer stress resistance to these crops very substantially.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:41):**  It's one of the best approaches and we're noticing that the tropical red and the tropical  brown seaweeds are particularly effective at some of these stress resistance increases.  And does it change the flavor?  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:53):**  No not at all.  But I also mean does it improve it maybe?  Well that's a good question.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:58):**  If you look at the micronutrient levels of our vegetables over the last few decades we've  lost most of the micronutrients of the vegetables due to this leaching.  And you know seaweeds have every element in nature and some abundance in their composition.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:16):**  So when you put the seaweed back into the soil and even at these very small quantities  you're getting these micronutrients that can help to actually regenerate the micronutrient  value of our vegetables.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:29):**  So I think there is an enormous value there and we like to use seaweed for food feed and  fertilizer and I think yes it's great for the soil and micronutrients and that part  was fine.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:40):**  And then we're also seeing amazing superfood properties of eating small amounts of seaweed  every day.  I mean every time I go surfing I'm eating seaweed when I'm out there.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:50):**  You know it's clean water and I've got some kelp or some seaweed that is rooted to the  rocks out there.  There's 14,000 species to try and nearly all of them are edible and most of my knowledge  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:02):**  in fact almost all of them are non-toxic.  And I think that's a let's say the nutrient density of food and the connection to healthy  soil something that comes back in this podcast a lot of times and I think it's potentially  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:14):**  one of the keys to unlock the sector and to really get the consumer or at least the food  sector more and more interested in healthy soils.  That is so true.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:23):**  I think you know seaweed as a nutraceutical has been absolutely amazing.  I just finished meeting with some researchers in Europe that have studied the effects of  seaweed for many diseases.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:37):**  One study I saw in the US that was about Asia showed of course on a countrywide basis about  seven times less breast cancer in countries like Thailand and Japan and furthermore in  a mouse model for breast cancer they observed 10 to 20 times lower tumor incidence in breast  
**[0:11:55-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:55):**  cancer when a small amount of seaweed was added to the water supply of these mice.  And that was very substantial because otherwise the diets were identical and so they were  able to reproduce this cancer effectiveness that the seaweed was very surprising.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:13):**  The European studies focused on Alzheimer's models for mice and they had these mouse models  for Alzheimer's and these were elderly mice and you know we're not able in this advanced  stage of the disease we're unable to remember how to get through a maze.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:32):**  But when they added a moderate amount of seaweed to the water supply for these mice they actually  recovered the ability of short-term memory to understand how to get through the maze.  And so these neuroprotective benefits and other health benefits of seaweed have been  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:50):**  amazing to read about in the peer-reviewed literature.  I think we can, I mean this is absolutely fascinating, we can probably spend two hours  just as food or seaweed as medicine.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:59):**  But if the advantages and many of these actually have been clear for a while, a lot of this  research is coming up now, but like the ecosystem services, the potential of cleaning up a lot  of the leaching etc has been known for quite a while, maybe not to the extent, and also  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:14):**  not to the extent of how much seaweed there actually was or in this case is the kelp forest  in California.  I think we all suffer from that, nobody can imagine anymore how full the Mediterranean  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:24):**  was with life as it is, nobody has seen it in their lifetime.  What is stopping this gigantic, let's say regeneration of our, even just our coastal  areas, if the advantages and the returns in all different aspects, not just financial,  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:41):**  are so enormous?  What do you see as the biggest barriers?  Well, first of all, there's a nutrient barrier and that's what we studied about the ecosystems.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:48):**  If we go back to the Permian extinction 250 million years ago, we find that the development  of that Permian extinction was associated with warming and stratification of the oceans.  And as the oceans warm, 93% of global warming is going into the oceans, we create this stratified  
**[0:14:06-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:06):**  layer of water and that forms a barrier to the upwelling that provides nutrients to algae.  And so the normal amount of offshore winds would normally bring the water up to the surface  and cause the overturning circulation and enable the seaweed to grow, and that gets  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:25):**  shut down when the ocean gets too warm.  And so we saw that in the Permian extinction where 96% of all marine life went extinct.  And according to the recent studies, we've already lost 2% of the oxygen in the ocean.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:40):**  And so we're 2% of the way towards the Permian extinction.  And the question is, can we stop it and reverse it one kelp forest at a time using this kind  of overturning principle?  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:50):**  And this would apply from the Mediterranean to the tropical oceans, even the subtropics.  So basically, what you're saying is there's this layer of water in the oceans or in the  seas, which is blocking the nutrient rich sub layer to come up basically.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:05):**  And that's what you're working on in marine permaculture, right?  To reverse that?  We are.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:10):**  We look to the tropics to use marine solar energy, also waves in the ocean, and even  wind energy in the higher latitudes to restore overturning circulation.  We have pipes that come up from below the thermocline.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:22):**  We can provide up to a million cubic meters of seawater per day to a larger seaweed permaculture  and effectively enable the irrigation 12 months a year of seaweed forest and enable it to  grow at least as much as it did under natural conditions, pre industrially.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:39):**  Yeah, so you're building these big pumps, as I'm imagining them, and I've seen them  in the past, to basically pump up this water or bring up this water from underneath this  blockage.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:48):**  You've been doing that at different places.  What are the results?  How fast is this?  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:53):**  What is the impact also beyond just the area around the pump?  Well, the first places we tested were in Hawaii.  And then from there, we went on and won the Blue Economy Challenge from the Australian  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:04):**  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  And there, they provided us with resources needed to do a small test system in Indonesia.  And in Indonesia, we found that with irrigation, the seaweeds were able to grow more than 2%  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:18):**  per day, whereas without the irrigation, it was less than 2%.  Now we're replicating those results in the Philippines.  And in the future, we hope to also do this testing with Macrocystis brown kelps off Tasmania,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:33):**  where we've been working with the University of Tasmania and our partners at 2040 and the  Intrepid Foundation.  And this sounds like a proof of concept.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:43):**  What is needed to get this to market and needed to scale as we're hopefully getting to a lot  of investors and entrepreneurs through this podcast?  What do you see as the next steps to really make this widely available?  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:57):**  We'll be moving over the next year from a small platform to a hectare scale platform.  And with the hectare in place, we'll be able to do so much more and really demonstrate  the economics of scaling to 100 hectares and more.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:11):**  We're very happy to have the support of Jeremy Grantham and his contributions have enabled  us to really develop the marine permaculture up to a hectare scale.  So we're looking forward to developing that initially in the Philippines and then showing  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:27):**  that it works in temperate latitudes such as Tasmania once we permit it with the authorities  there.  But then furthermore to develop it in key countries like Indonesia where there are more  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:39):**  than 2 million seaweed farmers, they grow hectares of seaweed, but they're on the front  lines of climate disruption.  And the warm layer of water is preventing a lot of the production.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:49):**  During the marine heat wave of 2016, over 60% of the yield of the seaweed farms was  lost and over half of the seaweed farms were abandoned on some islands in Indonesia.  So we have to help recover that in the subsistence seaweed farmers there in Indonesia.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:07):**  We really need to develop that capability so that the Indonesian farmers can have the  climate resilience that's built into the irrigation provided with deep sea water marine permaculture.  Just as a background, Jeremy Grantham is one of the founders of GMO, which is a big asset  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:25):**  manager which has nothing to do with GMO agriculture, but his foundation has been very active in  climate solutions.  I think he committed over a billion dollars recently to the climate change fight.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:37):**  And then secondly, I think it's so basically, you could almost see this as you're partnering  with seaweed farmers to enable them to be more climate resistant by basically growing  more or up to the original level or maybe beyond of what they were growing.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:52):**  But they already have a market.  So that's not a part you have to develop for the seaweed because they have offtake.  But they are being threatened now by climate change and by changing oceans around them  
**[0:19:01-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:01):**  basically.  So marine permaculture irrigation is a new product for an existing market.  It's over a $10 billion industry already in Asia.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:08):**  And we see huge opportunities to develop these technologies further for regions of Europe,  including the Mediterranean, including the tropical Atlantic and tropical and subtropical  Pacific oceans.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:21):**  And just to paint a picture, what do you envision in the Mediterranean as it seems not only  for Europe, but it seems an enormous hotspot the next decade or decades for climate change  for, I heard Morocco is going up five degrees and in terms of refugees, climate change,  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:38):**  stress, agriculture and obviously water.  What would you envision that we could do in the next decade?  Well, imagine regenerating life in the Mediterranean.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:48):**  We aspire to restoring the sardines in Sardinia.  We aspire to effectively creating the upwelling that's going to enable the seaweed forest  to thrive, the creation of fish habitat.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:02):**  And ultimately this bootstraps the sardines, the forage fish populations and the game fish  and even the apex predators.  We have the opportunity to regenerate life in the oceans.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:12):**  I imagine that the sardines might've been named after the island of Sardinia and wouldn't  it be great if we could regenerate those sardine fisheries from Israel all the way across to  Spain and Portugal.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:28):**  And if you would, let's imagine there's a theater full of active impact investors, people  that are enthusiastic about Regeneic or enthusiastic about marine permaculture.  What would you tell them without giving investment advice, obviously, but what would you tell  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:41):**  them where to look, what kind of questions to ask if they see things?  Because for sure they've been approached by algae companies, seaweed companies, this is  the future, left and right, et cetera.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:51):**  What would you advise them to look out for, to what kind of questions to ask when getting  into this part of the Regeneic sector?  Well, I think there's a key opportunity and that is developing new products for existing  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:05):**  industries and that's one reason we've been doing a lot of work, irrigation and seaweed  farms.  And beyond that, we're looking at a $350 billion agricultural input market, a $600 billion  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:17):**  nutraceutical market and an $800 billion cosmetics market.  And seaweed has a central role to play in all of those.  We find time and again, we're supply limited as to how much kelp, how much red seaweed  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:29):**  we can actually produce.  There's a global shortage of capyphyca seaweed, for example, and the prices have doubled over  the last year or two.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:37):**  And this is associated with a decreased production associated with higher temperatures in the  tropics.  So we've got a key opportunity and that is to regenerate that production, enable the  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:46):**  industry to get going again and to thrive, and then to further develop these markets  as the research is coming out on the nutraceutical side, we can improve the health span and I  would say the cognitive health span of so many people around the world that need to  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:00):**  move from a Western diet to something that's much more on the omega-3 side.  And keep in mind, these algae are the original source of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids.  The sardines get it from the algae.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:12):**  So the original source is actually a vegetarian source.  So you can go directly to the source and skipping the whole fish process in the middle.  Well, you can for those, I mean, there's half a half a billion vegetarians in India alone.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:25):**  So imagine vegetarians around the world who can improve their nutrition by a suitable  addition of seaweeds from around the world as well and locally.  And you mentioned somewhere in an interview I listened to actually, you're looking for  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:40):**  positive outliers.  Can you explain a bit of the concept behind that?  And how do you find them?  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:46):**  What kind of framework you have to look for these outliers?  Well, I remember after the Vietnam War, there was a serious problem with starvation and  children, and I remember that some physicians went to Vietnam and they noticed that a few  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:04):**  of the children were not being given more food, but they weren't starving.  And they did a lot of interviewing and eventually discovered a positive outlier.  And there were several actually.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:13):**  One is that the mothers of these children were giving them four half bowls of rice per  day rather than two cups of rice per day.  And so the more frequent meals and smaller portions were helpful.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:27):**  But they were also grabbing little bits of shrimp and crab that were growing in the rice  fields and they were adding this little bit of protein to the top of the rice.  And that tiny bit of addition of protein in minute quantities was sufficient to actually  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:42):**  enable muscle building and development and all these other things.  And so these tiny little bits of protein had a substantial effect as well.  And so these were examples in a medical context and a nutrition context where the positive  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:55):**  outliers were key.  But we also think in terms of ecosystems.  The kelp forest is the tropical rainforest of so many countries, including Morocco, including  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:07):**  California, including Australia.  You look to the Brazilian rainforest and the Amazon for being one of the most productive  ecosystems on the planet and it's able to fix approximately 2200 grams of carbon per  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:21):**  square meter per year.  But what's fascinating to me is that the kelp forest in their natural setting are actually  fixing 2500 grams of carbon, in some cases all the way up to 3000 grams of carbon per  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:34):**  square meter per year.  And that means that the actual carbon flux is higher in the kelp forest than it is in  the tropical rainforest.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:43):**  Now some of it gets eaten and respired and returns to the air.  But the fact that this natural ecosystem is capturing more carbon than the tropical rainforest  is really substantial.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:54):**  And the fact that we could find with marine permaculture substrate and marine permaculture  upwelling, we can take this beautiful ecosystem at the edge of the ocean and apply it to the  entire 300 kilometers of the exclusive economic zone of so many countries, from Morocco to  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:14):**  parts of Europe to the Americas and on to Asia.  United Nations talks about small island developing states, SIDS nations, and yet more recently  people have been calling them big ocean nations because even a small island nation could have  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:28):**  several million square kilometers of a big ocean around them.  And so this is a huge opportunity for coastal nations around the world to embrace the regeneration  of life in the sea, to rebuild the seaweed forests, regenerate fish habitat, and regenerate  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:46):**  the sardine fisheries and the forage fisheries that 3 billion people on the planet rely upon  for their primary source of protein.  So it's a big opportunity to really understand how can we use these natural processes to  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:59):**  regenerate life on the earth.  And I consider really understanding the kelp forest and seaweed ecosystems to be central,  positive outliers, examples of how nature has done a great job with fixing carbon during  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:11):**  the last millennia and millions of years.  Wow, again, so much to unpack, but I'd like to ask two questions.  One, can you explain a bit how the carbon is stored?  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:21):**  You mentioned some of obviously is getting eaten, some of it is not being stored permanently,  but also some of it is being stored permanently.  And then I would like to ask a second question on what's the risk?  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:32):**  What's the catch, so to say, and to stay in the theme.  It sounds too good to be true.  It sounds amazing.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:40):**  What is holding it back?  Is it so difficult to build these things at scale because maybe oceans are very rough?  What is the biggest risk or barrier you see?  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:49):**  But let's first start with the carbon storage.  Professor Carlos Duarte has published some papers studying from Cal State University,  studying how the global seaweed forests export carbon not locally, but into the middle and  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:01):**  deep ocean because of course, seaweed drifts and it drifts into the middle and into the  deeper ocean and then it sinks.  And so very naturally, some 11% or more of the kelp is stored that way.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:12):**  But beyond that, when we actually look to harvesting seaweed at sea, and there's some  work in Europe on developing the biorefinery, which will actually provide from the seaweed  harvest, sustainable partial harvest, a bounty of nutraceuticals, high value proteins, polysaccharides  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:33):**  and cellulose and other carbon.  This produces a, let's say, a cascade of valuable products that come from the seaweed.  And whatever the seaweed is not used, let's say we use half of it for food and half of  
**[0:27:46-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:46):**  it would be seaweed residues, the leftover seaweed that's not utilized can be sunk into  the middle and deep ocean, providing a true blue carbon sink.  And that could be well over 11%.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:00):**  Even most of the seaweed harvest, more than 50% could be residues that would, the seaweed  leftovers would be sunk to the middle and deep ocean in a period of perhaps even two  days that would go below 1000 meters.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:12):**  The typical seaweed can drop about 500 meters per day once it's been processed.  And so with the bubbles collapsed in the seaweed, it'll sink 500 meters a day and then in two  days it's below 1000 meters.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:26):**  And our physical oceanographer colleagues have identified that the median time to outcropping  for water that's 1000 meters and deeper is 100 to 4000 years.  And so that range provides the basis for developing the United Nations carbon credits, where with  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:42):**  100 years as the threshold for developing those.  So it presents a distinct opportunity to sink substantial amounts of carbon in it while  we're at the same time feeding the world and feeding natural ecosystems.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:54):**  And so what's the risk?  What do you see as the biggest risk as the interest grows?  Obviously, a lot of people just like in region egg on land are going to jump on this, which  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:03):**  means cowboys, which means projects and things not done well, means a lot of pitch decks  and a lot of floating numbers that promise a lot of things.  What do you see from your experience and being in the space for so long and probably have  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:18):**  seen and spoken to almost everyone?  What do you see as the biggest risk?  Well, in the Americas today, and perhaps in Europe as well, there are some regions near  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:25):**  shore that occasionally have harmful algal blooms.  And if there were harmful algal blooms already occurring, then marine permaculture upwelling  operation could potentially exacerbate those.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:37):**  So we need to monitor for the presence or growth of harmful algal blooms upstream.  And then monitor downstream as well.  And if there's a situation where there's an exacerbation or some problem is getting worse,  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:50):**  then the marine permaculture can be turned off.  And then that would remove the increase of harmful algal bloom.  So that monitoring for those situations would be important near shore.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:01):**  Further from shore, the incidence of those harmful algal blooms is far lower.  So it'd be less of a problem.  But that's an example where by developing a strong marine permaculture industry association,  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:12):**  we'll be able to advise on best practices around the world and ensure that we can develop  a strong industry association that commits to best practices and is able to regulate  the industry well enough within the association to avoid the need for overregulation.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:29):**  Because ultimately, we need to do well for the planet while we're actually doing well  for the economics as well.  And I'd like to be conscious of your time and end with a number of questions, which  
**[0:30:40-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:40):**  usually take up quite a bit of time.  So we're hopefully going to finish on time.  What if you could wave a magic wand and tomorrow morning, we wake up and you've changed one  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:50):**  thing in the agriculture or aquaculture, let's say food industry, what would that be?  Well, I think we would have the opportunity to work a lot more holistically with our food  sources.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:02):**  I think we need to move towards a more vegetarian lifestyle.  And that means vegetables on land and vegetables in the sea.  And these sea vegetables, there's so many to choose from.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:14):**  I think that's really a key part of this.  And as we move towards a somewhat more vegetarian lifestyle with treating meat becomes a condiment  rather than the main course, I think that's an opportunity to really change the way humans  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:29):**  eat.  Kofi Annan, as UN Secretary General said, if there's one thing we could possibly do,  it would be to eat one vegetarian meal per week.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:39):**  And not because that by itself would make such a big difference, but it would enable  people to realize how tasty a vegetarian meal could be.  And I think that's a really key because once I've learned how great vegetarian meals could  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:55):**  be, I mean, half the meals I eat are vegetarian.  I'm not 100% vegetarian, but it's a great way to reduce impact.  And I'm reminded of some other sayings Gandhi, I believe, said, you know, the earth has enough  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:09):**  for everyone's need, but not a single person's greed.  And if we apply that to a more vegetarian lifestyle, I think that is really significant  because we have enough food already to feed 10 billion people on this planet.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:23):**  But if we can simply reduce the intensity of the meat production, then so much of that  productivity can go towards feeding the entire planet and having enough food left over for  nature to ensure regeneration of those ecosystems.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:38):**  And to stay a bit in the livestock discussion, actually, you briefly mentioned and I know  there's quite a bit of research now on the methane, obviously, of livestock, ruminant  livestock and the potential of seaweed there.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:50):**  Can you briefly explain why that is important and how that came about and where we are,  let's say, as a sector, are we close to feeding it easily to cows or not?  What's the story on the methane, seaweed and livestock?  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:03):**  Yes, first of all, it's important to realize that the methane that we emit each year has  a bigger impact on our climate than the CO2 that's being emitted each year.  And that's because the methane that's being emitted has a multiplier of 28 or 50 or 70  
**[0:33:23-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:23):**  times the CO2 emission.  And so the methane emissions we're doing right now this year has a substantial incremental  impact on the climate.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:32):**  And the livestock emissions of methane are one of the largest emissions.  And so if we're able to eliminate most of the enteric emissions of ruminant livestock  of methane, that would have a very significant impact on a very significant source of greenhouse  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:51):**  gases each year.  And so we see this as a big opportunity and the fact that seaweed as an organic feed supplement  at a level of 1 to 10 percent of the feed is able to eliminate most of the enteric emissions  
**[0:34:05-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:05):**  of ruminant livestock is extremely significant.  It moves us towards more organic feed supplements and it also moves us towards a more holistic  lifestyle.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:14):**  What I love is how the seaweed is eaten by cows on the beach naturally of their own accord.  It's eaten by deer in New Zealand.  It's hundreds of observed deer at night eating seaweed off the beach in New Zealand as an  
**[0:34:29-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:29):**  example.  And the fact that it's being done naturally by these ruminant livestock to me is very  They're so mitigating.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:34):**  They are.  They are.  They know just the right amount.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:37):**  We should have seaweed salt licks on pastures around the country, around the world.  And we've got a billion cattle on the planet and whether it's 30 million cattle in Australia  or half a billion cattle in India, you know, there's this huge opportunity to ensure that  
**[0:34:55-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:55):**  globally we can get the seaweed to these livestock and enable them to have this more, you know,  this feed supplement that can be quite healthy for them as well.  And just to shift gear because I would like to ask a few questions.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:09):**  What if and I will explain why I'm asking this question.  You would wake up tomorrow instead of the metric want and the vegetarian diet or let's  say the day after tomorrow and you'll be in charge of a one billion dollar investment portfolio.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:22):**  And I'm asking this because I see in the sector a lot of interest coming to region ag, a lot  of interest coming to regeneration in general.  And I think we should start getting used to larger numbers, larger numbers of hectares,  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:34):**  larger numbers of square meters, larger number of acres and thus also larger amounts of investment  capital.  And I think as a sector, we need to get ready to absorb these kind of amounts and not be  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:46):**  frightened by it because of these these phone calls and these amounts will try to enter  this space.  And then we need to find a way to put them to work to regenerate as much soil and see  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:54):**  as possible.  So that's a bit of background.  If you would be in charge the day after tomorrow, where would you start investing?  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:02):**  Of course, you can also do partly grant, but let's focus on the ones where you would like  to have a financial return.  What would you be doing?  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:09):**  Well, I'll just provide some example that's close to home today in our development.  It's cost, we can develop and build marine permacultures at per capital costs and parts  that are on the order of $10 per square meter.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:22):**  But we have a roadmap to get us below $1 per square meter in the next few years.  And as we bring the cost down of marine permaculture, it becomes less expensive to develop new kelp  forest than it is to even buy farmland in Europe or the UK or perhaps even the US.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:40):**  So when you say costs, these are the pumps, the equipment, the platform to bring up this  nutrient dense colder water from below.  Correct.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:50):**  And also provide the substrate for the kelp forest and seaweed.  And so once this happens that we get below $1 per square meter, then we're looking at  less than a million dollars per square kilometer to develop these new permaculture facilities  
**[0:37:03-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:03):**  and infrastructure.  And not only can that permaculture provide a seaweed bounty and fish habitat and ultimately  a sustainable yield of fish, but it also cools off the mixed layer of the ocean.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:15):**  And that's enough to actually reverse coral bleaching.  And we're looking at the 1300 kilometers of the Great Barrier Reef and currently applying  for permits to test a small marine permaculture system that would not only grow seaweed, but  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:27):**  would also cool off the reef and protect it from coral bleaching.  Imagine if we could spend a billion in infrastructure to protect a $57 billion asset.  And that is the Great Barrier Reef.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:39):**  Imagine if we could do that as one of several examples.  Imagine if we could...  Oh, go ahead.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:44):**  No, I was asking about actually several examples.  Let's say you were forced by the trustees of the foundation or the bylaws of the investment  fund to diversify.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:55):**  What would be a few others you've seen around or you see, okay, what other interesting roadmaps  to get to those very interesting inflection points like the one you mentioned to get to  under a dollar?  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:06):**  What others do you see?  Well, I think there's opportunities in regenerative agriculture where we move from our green revolution  chemical understanding of the soil with NPK fertilizer and pH to the current generations  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:21):**  biological understanding of soil microbial communities.  And this is a place where the prebiotic of seaweed, petri dishes are made out of agar,  agar is made out of seaweed.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:31):**  The seaweed is an incredible prebiotic for conditioning the soil to actually facilitate  those soil microbial communities.  And the regeneration of soil microbial communities is key to carbon farming, where we're able  
**[0:38:45-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:45):**  to utilize the biodiversity below the soil as well as the biodiversity above the soil  to regenerate carbon fixation into our soils and potentially fix several gigatons of carbon  globally per year into the soils.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:59):**  And I think this carbon farming regenerative agriculture is really key to move towards  a deep biological understanding of the soil and how do we plant long roots and how do  we facilitate the regeneration of the microbial communities that are responsible for fixing  
**[0:39:14-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:14):**  so much carbon and holding onto that carbon for decades in the soils themselves.  And my final question, which usually ends up being a few more questions, but what do  you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture or let's say regenerative food  
**[0:39:29-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:29):**  systems in general that others don't believe to be true?  And this question is inspired by John Kempf, who usually asks it about agriculture in general,  but I like to ask it about what do you believe to be true about region ag and food that others  
**[0:39:40-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:40):**  don't believe to be true?  The permaculture design philosophy of adapting nature, I think is really key and moving from  mono specific crops to silvopasturing, where we have trees and livestock, or multi-layer  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:56):**  crops where we actually planted new crops over old crops and we've got winter cover  crops.  This is absolutely essential because 365 days a year, we want to have a living plant that  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:09):**  is actually feeding the microbes in the soil.  And so we have to move much more towards biodiversity.  We look at partial harvesting of kelp forests as a key opportunity because the kelp supports  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:21):**  dozens of species of epiphytes and even thousands of species of invertebrates and fish.  And it's actually that interspecies interaction that has a profound effect.  I'm reminded that in Hokkaido, Japan, they were harvesting nearly a million tons of herring  
**[0:40:35-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:35):**  every year from 1898 and for decades beyond that, until finally in 1953, the herring population  collapsed and those herring went extinct.  A few decades later, the Sakurina kelp forest also collapsed because it turns out the isotopic  
**[0:40:52-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:52):**  studies confirmed that the herring were fertilizing the Sakurina kelp forest, even at the same  time that the Sakurina kelp forest was providing the nursery and the egg laying habitat for  the herring.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:08):**  So it's this virtuous cycle of one ecosystem helping the other that we have to regenerate.  And it's this understanding of the nutrient value chains and circular value chains in  the life cycles of these ecosystems that is essential to our overall understanding.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:24):**  So I think we need to move agriculture more towards multi-species silvopasturing, intensive  silvopasturing as described in Drawdown, and marine permaculture where we're going, yes,  we harvest maybe one or two species, but we have so many more species living at the same  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:41):**  time.  And the predators are really our friends because they're helping to trim the crop.  And so ultimately, the permaculture design philosophy is managing levels of predators  
**[0:41:51-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:51):**  and prey to build a multi-trophic ecosystem.  And this integrated multi-trophic aquaculture is just one example.  But I think moving towards the permaculture design philosophy is an opportunity in the  
**[0:42:02-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:02):**  soils as well as the seas.  And what do you believe to be true in this sector?  Because this is something that at least not in the broad agriculture sector, but at least  
**[0:42:11-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:11):**  in the region X space is getting quite known, the multi-species in time and place.  Is there something that you believe to be true that others don't in the sector?  Well in our carbon farming innovators network in the United States, there are probably five  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:26):**  measures of soil quality, but they include biodiversity above the ground as well as biodiversity  in the microbes below the ground and other soil organisms.  It includes ensuring, well, by increasing this in the soil, we dramatically increase  
**[0:42:43-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:43):**  the water retention capacity of the soil.  And there are several other measures as well that effectively enable the, it enables water  retention in a way that doesn't exist otherwise.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:56):**  We've seen numerous examples in the US and Australia where a suitable biodynamic approach  to rebuilding soil enables those soils to absorb five times as much water as a traditional  green revolution soil, the compacted soil.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:15):**  And that is a profound effect.  I think it's been said that, well, it's less about how much water necessarily falls on  the soil as to what the soil does with the water.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:26):**  Is it able to absorb the water and how much?  And Alan Savery, I think, has pioneered this work in Africa and also in the United States.  And he loves to cite to that that when it does rain, we need to be able to absorb that  
**[0:43:40-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:40):**  rain.  And that means effective soil management.  So I think that's another key part of this is to really understand that contrary to traditional  
**[0:43:48-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:48):**  wisdom, silvopasturing involves rotating livestock across a crop in one or two days and then  giving that green pasture, if you will, 30 days to recover.  And then it grows even faster than it did before.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:02):**  This is part of the tenets of silvopasturing that move us toward an integrative approach  that may include trees and shrubs and some livestock.  And I think that achieving that balance at relatively low density is key.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:15):**  The other nontraditional wisdom, I think, is that we have an opportunity to do carbon  negative dairy and carbon negative livestock.  And I think it's one part seaweed and two parts rotational grazing and soil management.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:28):**  And I think within the next three to five years, we can achieve carbon negative dairy.  And yes, we should perhaps have less meat in our diet and maybe manage the amount of  dairy.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:39):**  But in 2030, we're still going to have meat and dairy.  And the thing is, to bring that industry carbon negative would be transformative to the economics  and the sustainability of those industries.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:49):**  And it literally is one part seaweed and two parts rotational soil management that can  bring us to a carbon negative in money of these critical industries.  That would be absolutely huge.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:59):**  I want to thank you so much, Brian, for your time.  I know you're extremely busy these months.  You were explaining before the podcast your amount of travel, which is coming up.

And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:19):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  Is this course free?  
**[0:47:30-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:30):**  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:47:38-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:38):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:50):**  Thank you.  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:47:59-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:59):**  so you don't have to ride along.  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:12):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:48:23-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:23):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  
**[0:48:32-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:32):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:40):**  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

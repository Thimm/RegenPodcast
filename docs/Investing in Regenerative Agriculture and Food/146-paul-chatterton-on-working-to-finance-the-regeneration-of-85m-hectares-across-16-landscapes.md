### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 04 Jan 2022 17:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:00):**  From Fiji to Slovakia, from Gabon to Scotland, there are very few people on the planet working  
**[0:00:05-0:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:05):**  on financing regeneration at a landscape scale level.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:09):**  So I'm super happy to check in again with Paul Chatterton of the Landscape Finance Lab  
**[0:00:13-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:13):**  who's currently working to finance the regeneration of 85 million hectares across 16 landscapes.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:22):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:26-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:26):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:27):**  Today I'm here to show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:31):**  space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:36):**  communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:41):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:44-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:44):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:47):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:50):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:55):**  attention to the dirt, soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:00:59):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:03-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:03):**  our work.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:04):**  And so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:06):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:11):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:15):**  For more information on the different tiers, benefits and how to become a member, check

**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:23):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:26):**  Welcome to another episode today with Paul, the founder of the Landscape Finance Lab,  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:30):**  which supports practitioners and investors to structure, launch and finance deals at  
**[0:01:34-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:34):**  a landscape scale.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:36):**  Welcome back, Paul.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:37):**  It's great to be here.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:38):**  I think someone called you the Oprah Winfrey of regenerative agriculture finance.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:43):**  I think that's very true.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:46):**  So be warned.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:47):**  Yeah, no pressure.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:48):**  Have a seat on the couch and let's get deep into your soul.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:53):**  You were with us in June 2019, which feels like a few centuries ago.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:01:59):**  And obviously, then I will link the interview below so you can have a listen of what it  
**[0:02:03-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:03):**  was then the Landscape Finance Lab.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:05):**  It has, I wouldn't say changed a lot, but shifted maybe a bit or nuanced differently.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:10):**  But for anybody that didn't listen to Dan, and don't go and find the website now because  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:13):**  we have Paul here, we can introduce the finance lab in a few minutes.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:17):**  What would you say when somebody basically has no clue what you're doing, what the finance  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:21):**  lab is, the landscape finance lab, and how would you introduce it in a couple of minutes  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:25):**  to someone that's completely new to the space?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:28):**  So the Landscape Finance Lab was set up to help landscapes, people in landscapes, build  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:35):**  a system that can draw down large finance, get large results, and do it in a way that  
**[0:02:41-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:41):**  suits them.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:42):**  That's our purpose.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:43):**  And we're a small team, there's only 10 of us from Brazil to Bali.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:48):**  We're having a lot of fun, and I think you're starting to see some amazing results around  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:54):**  the planet and the future is extraordinary.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:02:58):**  What's happening right now is really quite extraordinary.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:01):**  Yeah, because we've been talking about a landscape scale, I think for especially in, let's say,  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:07):**  conservation for a long time, but it seems to be, I mean, especially in our bubble start  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:13):**  to take off more and more.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:14):**  Do you still have that set of criteria we talked about last time?  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:17):**  I think it was at least a million hectares, at least a million people involved in the  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:23):**  landscape or around the landscape, and at least the finance need of $100 million.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:27):**  That was the big numbers just to say, okay, we're only looking at things at scale.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:31):**  Is that still the case or have you adjusted those criteria?  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:35):**  And a million tons of CO2 emission reduction.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:39):**  And a million tons of carbon, yeah, of course.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:41):**  Yeah, a million tons of traded goods.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:43):**  No, that's still our criteria.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:45):**  That's what we look for.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:47):**  We don't, or we will go under those numbers occasionally if there's a really powerful  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:53):**  opportunity to present a model for change.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:03:56):**  But we're finding some enormous appetite for change at that scale in landscapes right across  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:04:03):**  the world.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:04:04):**  Our biggest landscape, I think, is an 18 million hectare program on the corner between Cameroon,  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:04:11):**  Republic of Congo, and Gabon, some of the richest rainforests on this planet and the  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:04:17):**  most important place for elephant migrations and lowland gorillas as an example.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:04:23):**  But we've got some small but really powerful programs in, say, Scotland, 400,000 hectare  
**[0:04:31-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:04:31):**  landscape that has inside it twice the carbon content of all of the woodlands and forests  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:04:38):**  of the United Kingdom combined, this one area.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:04:41):**  Wow.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:04:42):**  Okay, let's unpack those two.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:04:43):**  I mean, there must be other examples, but let's say let's go from Gabon to Scotland.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:04:47):**  But in Gabon, is that the more traditional how to preserve the forest or what makes it  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:04:52):**  different in this case?  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:04:53):**  What brings you into it compared to maybe the traditional conservation NGOs, etc.?  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:04:59):**  Yeah, we're working with the traditional conservation NGOs, WWF and Wildlife Conservation Society  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:05):**  and so on.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:06):**  But the challenge for them and for us is to get much larger and longer term finance when  
**[0:05:12-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:12):**  you're trying to protect gorilla habitats or community land or whatever.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:21):**  Grant financing just doesn't cut it.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:24):**  It's short term, it's small scale, and you really can't make the change you need over  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:28):**  a massive landscape like that.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:30):**  And then you're also fighting against enormous financing for mines and railways and other.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:36):**  So how do you change the game?  
**[0:05:38-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:38):**  That's what we've been looking at.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:39):**  How do you use that power of commercial finance and some of the new carbon finance to get  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:45):**  investment at the scale of 100 million and above into those landscapes for decades so  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:50):**  that you can really make a difference.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:52):**  And in this case, let's say in the region there, what's the angle for the investors  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:57):**  to come in?  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:58):**  Is that carbon?  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:05:59):**  Is that sustainable logging?  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:00):**  Is that ecotourism?  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:01):**  Is it all the above?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:03):**  What's the main hook that's different now compared to 10 years ago or 20 years ago?  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:07):**  And we also wanted to preserve those forests, but somehow didn't manage to find long term  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:11):**  finance and mostly relied on grants.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:13):**  With a few hooks, the cocoa industry is worried about being seen to be the destroyer of rainforest.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:20):**  So we've worked with Barry Calibert, the world's largest cocoa trader.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:25):**  And now all of the cocoa actors in Cameroon to create a roadmap for deforestation free  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:32):**  cocoa and three landscapes where that can be rolled out.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:36):**  So that's one hook.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:37):**  And then another is the logging industry and carbon.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:40):**  There's a whole lot of carbon money coming.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:42):**  There's a $150 million investment in the Republic of Congo from the World Bank.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:48):**  So looking at how to bring that to the ground and protect some key wildlife corridors, but  
**[0:06:55-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:55):**  also make opportunities for the logging sector.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:06:57):**  We want the certain areas where they shouldn't be operating, but there's plenty of areas  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:01):**  where forests can be restored and logging can happen.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:05):**  So building the industry as a whole.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:07):**  I think that's the big difference when you start looking at this next level of scale,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:12):**  you can actually find synergies between different industries that in the past have been competitors.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:18):**  And that's where it gets really exciting.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:20):**  Like, like an example there would be cacao and the logging industry, or is it the carbon  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:25):**  industry in the log?  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:26):**  Like what is an exciting synergy you've seen or noticed?  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:29):**  Well, the synergy between the conservation industry and the logging industry, for instance,  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:34):**  but certainly cacao and forestry, community forestry and commercial forestry.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:41):**  And then, you know, over time, there's the opportunity to bring in other agricultural  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:45):**  players.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:46):**  The real palm industry wants to operate in that area, but knows that it will be seen  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:51):**  as very negative if it's destroying rainforest, how can we find the right land and work with  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:07:57):**  communities to build its industry without damaging these very special habitats.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:03):**  And then Scotland, what is exciting about Scotland as it is a smaller landscape, you  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:06):**  said 400,000 compared to the million, but it's a lot of carbon.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:10):**  So that's probably why it got an exception.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:12):**  Describe the landscape for anybody that hasn't been there.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:15):**  What do you see and what then will go to work?  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:18):**  Do we hope to see in 10 years or so?  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:20):**  Well, I went to the Glasgow COP climate conference and that was exciting, but a bit depressing.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:27):**  But then I had a chance to spend three days traveling around this landscape.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:32):**  It's right up in the very North, just near John O'Groats and it's spectacular.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:36):**  You've got the Highlands in the distance and they dropped down onto these long plains that  
**[0:08:42-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:42):**  are full of these beautiful peak lands and little valleys with forest in them, struts.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:49):**  And then that drops over wild sea cliffs into the ocean.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:53):**  You know, there's castles sitting on these cliffs.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:55):**  It's classic Scotland.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:56):**  It's really beautiful.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:08:57):**  But, you know, crazily, and this is our challenge, the UK created incentives for tree planting  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:06):**  in the 1980s that planted trees all across this really important landscape and damaged  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:12):**  the peak lands, damaged the carbon storage potential.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:15):**  And those plantations are not viable, well, not very viable.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:19):**  And now they're being pulled out.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:20):**  So Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has been digging up 22,000 hectares of these  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:27):**  forests, including pulling the roots out of the trees and restoring the peak land.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:32):**  It's massive.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:33):**  And that will be a really important storage for carbon for the UK.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:38):**  And I think a model for the rest of Europe and the temperate zone.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:41):**  This is the most concentrated carbon you get in the Northern hemisphere in the temperate  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:47):**  zone.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:48):**  In the peak lands.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:49):**  The peak lands, yes.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:50):**  So they're incredibly important and they're very important for bird life and all sorts  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:53):**  of other, for salmon rivers, for fishing industry, for hunters and so on.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:09:59):**  So making sure it works for everyone is what we're now looking at.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:04):**  And so it sounds sort of counterintuitive, removing the trees to give space to peak lands,  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:09):**  but it's removing the non-native I'm imagining, or at least not where the tree should be.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:14):**  That's what you're saying, right?  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:15):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:16):**  It's spruce that was just planted as an investment opportunity and had very little value for  
**[0:10:23-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:23):**  the local communities.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:24):**  So I think that's a challenge for when you do get a hundred million dollar investment  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:29):**  for landscapes, how to make sure that that's invested in a way that works for the communities,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:34):**  works for nature, works for the longterm.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:37):**  And we're really working on methodologies that allow everyone to get together and plan  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:43):**  out over that really, you know, over many generations, what they want and how this is  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:48):**  going to work.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:50):**  And so how would that landscape look like?  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:51):**  Like how does you describe a bit how it looks now?  
**[0:10:54-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:10:54):**  Would there be more like reforestation upstream to protect something like what would the fundamental  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:01):**  change be besides taking out the trees and giving more space to the peak lands?  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:06):**  What would that landscape look like in let's say 10 years, if you go back there compared  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:09):**  to now?  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:10):**  Continuing the work that's happening already, removing the trees and tourism infrastructure  
**[0:11:15-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:15):**  and so on.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:16):**  But I think planting trees in the river valleys that had trees before, and these were, you  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:21):**  know, Rowans and birches and so on.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:25):**  Planting more trees up on the edge of the highlands to make sure that the water flow  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:29):**  continues through the peak lands.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:31):**  The big danger is that peak lands across the world will dry up and become net emitters.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:37):**  And that's already happening in many parts of the world.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:39):**  So if we can keep these peak lands wet, they'll store the carbon forever.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:44):**  And then using the investment, the carbon finance that comes in to benefit the whole  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:51):**  community and to build businesses, to invest in businesses.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:54):**  A big challenge is to bring the small people along with the big people.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:11:59):**  The danger with carbon finance is that the rich get richer, the landowners get richer  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:03):**  and everyone else suffers or comes along on their tails.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:08):**  So we're starting with the crofters, the small landowners and working out solutions for them  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:15):**  first and then working our way up to the larger landowners and so on.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:19):**  And I think that's really important, that justice and fairness and looking after the  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:25):**  smallest actors in the landscape is the first thing.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:29):**  Because in Scotland, is that a land ownership is there?  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:32):**  I don't know the region, but just as in many places, it's relatively concentrated.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:37):**  Like large landowners became larger over the last years as well as the people moved away,  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:41):**  et cetera.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:42):**  Is it quite concentrated?  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:43):**  So the danger is the large ones anyway.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:45):**  I mean, access to these kinds of finance and carbon finance, et cetera, is sometimes difficult  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:50):**  and maybe it doesn't make sense if you don't own so much.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:52):**  Is the land ownership relatively distributed or very concentrated in Scotland?  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:57):**  A little bit concentrated.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:12:58):**  Four hundred and thirty two people own half of Scotland.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:02):**  Can you believe it?  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:03):**  Wow.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:04):**  Astonishing.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:05):**  I've never seen anything like it anywhere.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:08):**  It's an incredibly class segregated society and everyone has the battle of colloquium  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:14):**  still at the top of their minds.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:16):**  If you've watched Outlander, this battle in 1742, it's still firmly remembered because  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:24):**  the people who lived on the land were pushed off afterwards by the clearances.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:30):**  And that's still very present.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:31):**  So there's a few large landowners, lords, sheiks, oligarchs and now conservation organizations.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:39):**  And then a lot of small people who hold land holdings towards the edges of the territory.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:46):**  So making sure that everyone grows together and over time building a fairer system is  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:52):**  going to be really important.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:54):**  And how would that, like, that sounds like some kind of distribution, redistribution  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:13:58):**  of land, which is a land ownership is a whole different discussion and rabbit hole, obviously.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:02):**  But some people we've interviewed like Thomas Ripple and others see the private land ownership  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:08):**  as actually the key to regeneration or getting rid of private land ownership.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:12):**  What do you see when you say a fairer system?  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:14):**  What do you envision there?  
**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:15):**  How would that work?  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:16):**  Oh, I've got no idea.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:17):**  I'm not going to get involved in Scottish politics.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:22):**  What is being discussed is, you know, obviously, if you own land, you're not going to give  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:27):**  it up.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:28):**  But if there's pressure like that and inequalities like that, a lot of landowners are starting  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:32):**  to think, well, what can I share?  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:34):**  How can I share these benefits with others?  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:37):**  And this is a question for the world of carbon.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:40):**  I would say even you could give it up.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:42):**  I mean, in a sense, I see farmers in Germany that have farmed organically, let's say, for  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:48):**  the last 30 years are getting closer to their retirement.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:51):**  And Thomas Ripple can do a much better job at explaining it, but are getting closer to  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:55):**  their retirement.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:56):**  All their money is and their wealth is in their land, but they don't want to sell to  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:14:59):**  the highest bidder, even though they have amazing soils because they've been farming  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:02):**  traditionally organic, let's say, for the last 30 years.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:05):**  And there is like, how do we figure out there is a transition needed there unless they sell  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:09):**  to a developer or something?  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:11):**  We lose that land and we lose that possibility.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:13):**  We lose the soil as well.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:15):**  And they are working on basically a pension scheme for these kind of farmers that want  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:18):**  to really have the intrinsic motivation to give other people access to that land, to  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:23):**  give other people the opportunity to farm in a way that makes sense for the land and  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:26):**  not be pressured by an enormous loan that they had to take out of the bank to buy this  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:30):**  farmland.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:31):**  So they basically sit down with that farmer and say, okay, what do you need?  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:35):**  In terms of what do you need as a pension?  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:36):**  What do you need as a bit of cash upfront to buy a piece of land somewhere, build a  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:40):**  house and be fine?  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:41):**  And what do you need per month?  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:43):**  And usually if you do the calculation, you get to a much lower amount compared to you,  
**[0:15:47-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:47):**  the land value.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:48):**  And of course they have to promise when they buy the land from this farmer and have the  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:51):**  farmer retire is that the land will never be farmed conventionally, will never be sold,  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:56):**  will never be speculated and will be hauled in the commons, but will be probably farmed  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:15:59):**  by six families or five compared to one, which is also very interesting from a, so the ownership  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:04):**  changes, but the access some becomes accessible for a number of different families to farm  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:08):**  as regeneratively as possible and, and basically make a living of life, which probably is also  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:12):**  legacy that that farmer wanted.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:14):**  So there are actually some owners that are starting to think in the same purpose discussions,  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:19):**  we have a lot with purpose ventures or the steward ownership, like what is that land  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:23):**  and how can it live on forever?  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:25):**  Even if, because otherwise maybe your family gets involved at some point and starts cutting  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:29):**  it up.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:30):**  And I mean, we all know the issues that can happen with that.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:33):**  So I think it's a very interesting, slow discussion, but the ownership discussion is very interesting  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:37):**  because some people are willing to give up a very big check to make sure that the land  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:41):**  will be stewarded in a better way.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:44):**  I was talking to the head of the European landowners association who represents the  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:48):**  big, big and small landowners.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:52):**  And he was saying that, um, you know, the old farmers, some of them are gifting their  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:56):**  land for conservation or for community purposes and so on.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:16:59):**  And that's fantastic.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:01):**  Young landowners are coming up and many of them are thinking in a regenerative way and  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:05):**  a, and a generous way in working with their communities.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:09):**  They're seeing that it makes sense to that you can grow your business by sharing the  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:14):**  value of your land.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:16):**  You can grow it even more than, than trying to do it by yourself.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:19):**  And I think that's the sort of models that we're going to be testing.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:22):**  Can you get carbon financing and have the local communities manage your land with you  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:28):**  and really grow the value for the communities, you know, give them access to parts of your  
**[0:17:32-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:32):**  land, create tourism activities or small ventures, small agricultural ventures that work with  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:40):**  the communities and some of the innovators in the communities and draw young people back  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:44):**  into the, into those communities.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:46):**  I've got no idea what this is going to be in Scotland.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:49):**  We're only beginning.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:50):**  And do you see that happening?  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:51):**  Like do you see the interest for young people?  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:54):**  Because that's, I think a topic that is close to anybody's heart.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:17:57):**  Like how do we get this huge march towards the urban environments?  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:01):**  How do we reverse that partly?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:03):**  And how do we bring people back to the land?  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:05):**  Because they've mostly been depopulated basically either forcefully or unforested.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:08):**  But in Scotland, what do you see?  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:10):**  I mean, you mentioned tourism a few times.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:12):**  Do you, what are the potential ventures?  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:14):**  There are potential things in terms of agriculture.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:16):**  What do you see?  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:17):**  Is that on the hunting side?  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:19):**  Is it actually the agriculture, agriculture side?  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:21):**  Is it grazing?  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:22):**  What do you see as a potential for that landscape?  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:25):**  Or is that too early?  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:26):**  It is too early, but we've just been brainstorming.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:29):**  But you know, the brainstorms have gone, have included all of those things.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:33):**  As well as thinking about these places as attractors for young people from the city.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:39):**  I mean, it's impossible.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:41):**  The cost of living in cities these days is getting impossible for young people.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:46):**  And these places.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:47):**  So put a good internet connection and you're good to go.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:50):**  Then you're good to go.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:51):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:52):**  And why not live in one of the most beautiful places on the planet?  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:18:55):**  The flow country, this landscape I'm talking about is a world heritage listed in a couple  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:00):**  of years.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:01):**  It'll be the world's first peak land world heritage area.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:04):**  There'll be all sorts of people coming to visit this.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:08):**  So plenty of opportunities to build businesses.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:10):**  But we were also reflecting on, wouldn't it be a nice place to just live and do your telecommuting,  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:16):**  do your business if you don't have to be in a high rise somewhere.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:20):**  Remote working, they call it, Paul, these days, not telecommuting.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:23):**  Oh, that's right.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:25):**  Sorry.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:26):**  You get Elon Musk, Starlink or somebody to set up a ridiculously fast satellite connection  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:32):**  and you're good to go.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:34):**  You need some good coffee.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:35):**  And I mean, what else do you need?  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:37):**  Coffee is critical.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:39):**  And of course, whiskey.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:41):**  Which landscape can provide.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:43):**  That's fascinating.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:45):**  So what have you seen in like the last years when we talked, it seems centuries ago, but  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:50):**  it's only two and a half years.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:52):**  Like on the landscape level, I mean, these are two new landscapes.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:19:55):**  I think you were, you were already working in the Republic of Congo, but not, I think  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:00):**  in that corner.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:01):**  What have you seen in the landscapes itself?  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:04):**  Are there way more people reaching out that are working in these landscapes to work with  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:07):**  you to figure out financing are more, I hope so that more people are discussing like let's  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:13):**  move beyond grants.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:14):**  We have to find like what has been the discussion in the landscape when you visit them, have  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:18):**  they been different from three years ago compared to now or has it been very similar?  
**[0:20:22-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:22):**  There's been a massive explosion.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:24):**  I mean, we spent five years building the lab inside the conservation organization WWF,  
**[0:20:29-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:29):**  and we span out in June, set up a new independent lab based here in Austria.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:37):**  Of all places.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:39):**  But I mean, it's a country with 25% I think of the agriculture is organic.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:42):**  I mean, you're a lighthouse in certain, certain ways.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:46):**  Absolutely for some stunning landscapes, but you're not working in Australia.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:49):**  I think you're working mostly elsewhere.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:50):**  We're talking with some people who might want to develop some landscape in Austria up in  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:55):**  the Salzburg mountains, which would be lovely.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:20:59):**  But yeah, that has been a complete explosion this year, particularly in landscape activity.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:21:07):**  We're seeing it from the landscapes, but that's been a continuous progression.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:21:11):**  We're now seeing the investors starting to realize this business to be made here.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:21:16):**  And that's partly because of the climate agreement, but also because of scope three and so on.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:21:24):**  But also because of models that are now starting to come out, business models that are coming  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:21:30):**  out from the garment industry, from the agriculture industry and so on, sort of built around landscapes.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:21:37):**  And so they're seeing financial returns from real investment, not just carbon investment  
**[0:21:44-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:21:44):**  at landscape scale.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:21:45):**  And suddenly, I mean, in Glasgow, I had three breakfasts one morning with three different  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:21:51):**  sets of bankers, each of them building half a billion or billion dollar funds for different  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:21:57):**  things that related to landscape, carbon regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:01):**  And I forgot what the third one was.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:04):**  Should get them on the show.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:06):**  So what is, I mean, beyond carbon, I mean, you call it real investment.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:09):**  So what is an example of real investments?  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:11):**  We talked about, I think last time, I think it was IKEA in Slovakia, if I'm not mistaken,  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:16):**  and H&M in Bangladesh and also something in one of the island states that was suffering  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:21):**  from sugar cane and the tourism industry was suffering because of the runoff of agriculture.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:26):**  But for anybody interested in that, listen to the last episode.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:28):**  But what are you seeing like in terms of quote unquote real investments in where do you see  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:32):**  like something you didn't expect like over this year?  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:35):**  Like, wow, okay, of course, there's a connection there.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:36):**  But I never thought about it.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:39):**  Well, the Fiji one has gone really well.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:41):**  That's Fiji.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:42):**  It was Fiji.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:44):**  So we've set up a, an investment incubation company called Matan Ataki, which is aiming  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:51):**  at a $50 million investment into Fiji.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:53):**  They've already got 12 million in, they've purchased some waste dumps, would you believe,  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:22:58):**  and they're turning them into recycling centers because that's the most urgent poison on the  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:03):**  reefs of Fiji.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:05):**  So it's not the agriculture, but it's the waste runoff basically, because just as a  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:09):**  bit of context, Fiji realized and the tourism industry, the hotels, et cetera, realized  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:14):**  that their reefs are dying.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:16):**  And if they die, obviously their main draw for tourism ends and people won't come to  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:21):**  Fiji anymore and are working with you to figure out, okay, what are the, and the people on  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:25):**  the ground because you have an amazing team on the ground or you're working with amazing  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:27):**  people on the ground to figure out, okay, was the, the agriculture runoff from the sugar  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:31):**  cane plantations, which I hear in multiple places.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:34):**  I think Mauritius is also trying to do a shout out to regeneration Mauritius is trying to  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:38):**  change that as well, because it's from all sides, not a profitable business model to  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:42):**  grow sugar cane.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:43):**  And of course also the waste recycling is absolutely crucial because you're basically  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:47):**  bleaching and killing your reefs by what flows into your river.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:51):**  And the circle is so close, it's so small when you talk about islands, because it's  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:55):**  right there, like it's your island, it's everything that happens on the island.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:23:58):**  That's what influences the reef.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:00):**  Like you cannot point to a big neighbor or something because it's not there.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:03):**  Like it's, it's definitely your island that causes many of these things and hopefully  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:08):**  triggers you to do something.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:09):**  You've got a good memory.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:10):**  Definitely the Oprah effect.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:11):**  I can see the...  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:12):**  Sounds like I listened to the old podcast, but actually I didn't.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:14):**  So I should have done that as preparation, but because it's fascinating and for sure  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:20):**  I've told that story a few times.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:23):**  So it's interesting the waste and then it's a 12 million you mentioned and it's going  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:26):**  to fill up to 50 and it's going to target anything that basically damages the reef.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:30):**  Is that what I'm...  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:31):**  That's right.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:32):**  So the team has already reviewed 120 business opportunities.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:37):**  There are 10 that are investment ready now.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:39):**  So they're desperately looking for finance for these.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:42):**  I'd love to get them invested quickly and an operational, some of them are organic agriculture,  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:48):**  which takes all of the fertilizers and pesticides off the reef, you know, to Merrick.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:53):**  And sells to the hotel industry, obviously, because Fiji, the last part I forgot to mention  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:24:57):**  is imports a lot of food, which is I would say hilarious, but sort of crazy.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:02):**  In that distance.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:03):**  They're importing organic avocados and pineapples from Queensland.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:08):**  It's insane.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:09):**  So, you know, but they have a company that's selling to Merrick to Walmart and wants to  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:14):**  expand their factories, expand to a number of more factories, which would be fantastic.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:20):**  The replace sugar cane with that was a coral receding companies.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:25):**  So replanting the corals where they get damaged.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:29):**  There's a solar based energy, floating solar panels that can be used for small villages  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:36):**  or hotels, a whole range of things.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:39):**  It's really exciting.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:40):**  And is 50 million enough or what are you, what's your...  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:44):**  I expect not.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:45):**  It's growing rapidly.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:47):**  And these guys were invited to present at the general assembly of the United Nations  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:52):**  just two months ago.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:54):**  They're really getting some, some attentions, but they need money.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:25:58):**  So contact me if you are, if you look up Matanotaki, if you are an investor, it's really good stuff.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:05):**  And parallel to that, we're waiting for a $30 million investment in, for the government  
**[0:26:11-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:11):**  to create a great barrier reef marine park authority type arrangement for Fiji that will  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:17):**  protect the reefs, manage them, monitor them and create incentives for businesses and communities  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:22):**  to look after them.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:24):**  And that's a nice parallel.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:27):**  Getting both of those together makes the system much stronger because it's very costly as  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:31):**  a business to monitor your system.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:33):**  If you can have a professional monitoring system that does that, it takes a lot of pressure  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:37):**  off and that means that you can really focus on impact.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:42):**  And do you see other island states like since then reaching out to you and saying, let's  
**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:47):**  do the same?  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:48):**  Solomon Islands, Indonesia.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:50):**  And there's, there's a few other possibilities coming as well.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:54):**  So that's really exciting.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:56):**  Thinking about a big island state, Indonesia.  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:58):**  That's a massive one.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:26:59):**  Well, actually, you know, going back to your question, what have you seen that surprised  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:27:04):**  you?  
**[0:27:05-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:27:05):**  Indonesia, when we first set up the lab, we worked with Michelin Tire company and WWF  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:27:13):**  to help design a landscape program for the center of Sumatra.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:27:18):**  This little thin ribbon of forest that runs across the center that has tigers, orangutans  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:27:24):**  and elephants, one of the only places to get them all together.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:27:27):**  Michelin wanted to shift their production to be more wildlife friendly, to be actively  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:27:33):**  protecting the rainforest, because they didn't want to be blamed for the destruction of this,  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:27:38):**  the extinction of tigers in that landscape, for instance.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:27:42):**  That was initially designed as a public investment program, but it was taken off our hands enjoyfully  
**[0:27:48-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:27:48):**  because it became a $215 million sustainability bond invested in by BNP Paribas and designed  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:27:58):**  by ADM Capital.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:00):**  We can't take much credit for that, but the model is brilliant.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:03):**  The monitoring framework is very good.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:06):**  Here it's working reasonably well, but that's the sort of thing that's possible with large  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:12):**  corporate engagement.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:13):**  So you can do small business like Fiji, or you can work with large corporates to create  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:18):**  those sort of systems as well.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:20):**  Yeah, I will link it below.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:21):**  I heard about the bond.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:23):**  So it's basically Michelin as a company that makes tires, which is interesting that they're  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:26):**  protecting tigers because I think Goodyear, their competitor has a tiger as a logo or  
**[0:28:30-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:30):**  something like that.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:32):**  And so that's ironic, but they need rubber, obviously they need a lot of rubber.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:36):**  And so I think they work together with BNP Paribas, like you mentioned, to issue a bond,  
**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:40):**  like a corporate bond for themselves.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:41):**  I mean, a lot of green bonds have been issued.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:43):**  We did an interview, and I'm blanking on the name, with I think the Climate Bond Initiative  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:48):**  and I'll put it below as well.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:50):**  Like there's an incredible amount of money in the debt space or in the bond space, not  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:54):**  necessarily in the equity space as well, but the debt space just dwarfs it by I don't know  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:58):**  how many times.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:28:59):**  And the first things around RegenEgg are coming and restoration.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:03):**  This is Michelin raising 250 million.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:05):**  And there is a lot of low cost capital in the market for these kinds of things and spending  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:09):**  it fully on these kinds of projects, monitoring it, measuring it, etc.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:13):**  And it's a very cheap way for them to do this.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:15):**  Well, of course, it helps their production, that gigantic and shields them from a lot  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:20):**  of risk, reputational risk, and long term access to rubber, which I imagine is a commodity  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:25):**  that also went up in pricing quite a bit over the last year or so.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:28):**  So that's fascinating.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:29):**  And then it becomes real money, like 250 million.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:32):**  It's not crazy, but it's a serious amount of money.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:34):**  And it's just an example like, okay, let's structure more of these types of finance where  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:40):**  it's so easy for pension funds to be part of that because they always have been doing  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:43):**  it.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:44):**  It's not super scary.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:46):**  Well, this year, there's already been $350 billion of issuances of green bonds, according  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:53):**  to the Climate Bonds Initiative.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:54):**  And what's really changing, I mean, I used to sit on the standards committee for CPI,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:29:59):**  so I watched this very carefully.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:01):**  About three years ago, four years ago, 1% of the total amount would go to land use.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:06):**  Most of it would go to buildings, energy transport.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:10):**  Now land use is getting 14% of that amount.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:14):**  So 14, 14.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:16):**  It's a massive growth in the amount of money that's available for land use.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:22):**  Especially as the climate bond space grew a lot as well.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:25):**  Like this is not just the 14 times, this is much more because the total amount also increased.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:30):**  Will be much, much larger.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:31):**  That's right.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:33):**  So there's all of this money out there looking for good projects.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:35):**  There's very few projects, so let's all get cracking and build a few.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:39):**  Do you see that as the biggest challenge?  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:41):**  Like we need more quote unquote boring projects, boring investments, not boring projects.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:47):**  Projects are very exciting, but boring investments that can easily absorb these kinds of amounts.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:30:53):**  We need super exciting projects that are really boring structurally so that the bankers don't  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:00):**  get scared.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:01):**  And that's, you know, that's the challenge with landscape programs is that they have  
**[0:31:05-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:05):**  lots of moving parts at the moment.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:07):**  So we're really working to simplify them and create a single product that is a landscape  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:12):**  investment vehicle.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:14):**  And then that investment vehicle like invests in different things or how would that work?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:18):**  Because there you combine, I mean, what we heard before is carbon and agriculture, aquaculture  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:22):**  and recycling.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:23):**  And like, would it all be combined in like a landscape bond or investment vehicle or  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:28):**  would it be cut in pieces so everybody can choose whatever they find more appealing to  
**[0:31:32-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:32):**  them?  
**[0:31:33-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:33):**  It depends on the landscape.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:34):**  But if you take the Fiji example, you know, Matan Ataki is the investment vehicle.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:39):**  They don't hold the money.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:41):**  The money goes straight to the businesses from the investors, but they create the opportunities  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:46):**  and make sure it all works because it's very hard to work out what's investable in Fiji.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:52):**  So you can get to scale that way.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:53):**  In the case of Sumatra and the Jambi bond, it was a single vehicle that does multiple  
**[0:31:58-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:58):**  things.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:31:59):**  The other landscapes will design it in different ways.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:02):**  But I think generally it will be a special purpose vehicle that all the landscape actors  
**[0:32:06-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:06):**  get together and design between them.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:09):**  And that holds the money and transfers the funds to the investments or facilitates the  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:14):**  flow at least.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:16):**  Because then it might get tricky because they're, I mean, different projects or different investments  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:21):**  within the landscape have a different risk profile.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:23):**  It might also get more interesting because you sort of balance the risk together.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:27):**  But what is the feedback there when you talk to those bankers?  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:29):**  Let's say you have the breakfast you had last week or two weeks ago, three weeks ago.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:34):**  What is your main feedback you give these bankers that are designing the 500 million  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:37):**  or a billion dollar investment funds for things that touch the landscape?  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:42):**  Is there something you can share with them that's like, look, you're maybe approaching  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:46):**  it to like two reductionists or what's your feedback generally to people that want to  
**[0:32:51-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:51):**  design something at banks?  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:53):**  We say to them, it's the most exciting journey.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:55):**  Come and join with them.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:32:57):**  It works best when the bankers get on the ground with us right from the beginning in  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:01):**  the jungles or the reefs or the peatlands.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:03):**  You must have stories there.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:06):**  Yeah, they're not going to turn that down.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:10):**  But you know, if they're with us looking at the problem and helping to structure the solutions,  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:16):**  then they'll have confidence and understanding in how it works and the whole thing will be  
**[0:33:21-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:21):**  simpler and more effective.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:23):**  Now, you know, this is a new product.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:25):**  So we also say to them, this is not for the faint hearted.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:28):**  You've got to be prepared to take time, put in some early money for design, which you  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:34):**  won't get back or you can maybe can get back later on if you structure that in.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:39):**  But it's still a challenging space.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:42):**  But I think if you're an early leader in this space, it's growing so rapidly that there'll  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:47):**  be plenty of benefits down the line.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:49):**  So time for some shout outs.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:50):**  Who are the leaders in the space?  
**[0:33:52-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:52):**  Who should we look at for now?  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:33:54):**  Commercially, I think some of the multilateral development banks are worth looking at.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:34:01):**  FMO has, I mean, we're working with FMO on the Dutch Fund for Climate and Development,  
**[0:34:07-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:34:07):**  which is $160 million investment fund that invests in 10 landscapes, 35 nature based  
**[0:34:15-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:34:15):**  solution projects.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:34:16):**  That's a very interesting model.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:34:19):**  You've got the BNP Paribas who have a portfolio of projects.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:34:25):**  The United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative has invested with Rabobank and  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:34:32):**  a whole range of other players in agricultural finance of Brazil.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:34:38):**  What's it called?  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:34:39):**  The Agri3.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:34:40):**  I'll find the name and you can put it in the notes afterwards.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:34:47):**  But they're doing really, really interesting creative financing.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:34:52):**  But now what we're seeing is investment houses are coming along that are creating genuinely  
**[0:34:56-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:34:56):**  commercial investments that don't require MDB finance and they're really exciting.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:35:03):**  We've had a discussion two weeks ago with a Swiss investors who are creating a billion  
**[0:35:10-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:35:10):**  dollar regenerative agriculture fund with the aim to create a forward loan for carbon  
**[0:35:19-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:35:19):**  programme development that then gets paid back on the carbon money that comes later.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:35:25):**  And so it'll be commercial, it'll be carbon and eventually it'll be biodiversity credits  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:35:31):**  coming out of this as well and targeted for corporates who want to invest and get their  
**[0:35:36-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:35:36):**  money back, but also want to buy carbon and carbon and biodiversity credits.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:35:39):**  That's the sort of thing that's coming down the line and there'll be many more of these,  
**[0:35:44-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:35:44):**  but that's not unique.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:35:45):**  Super, super interesting.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:35:46):**  And so what do you, I mean, we're almost at the end of the year.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:35:51):**  What do you look back to at this year as has been the most exciting piece?  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:35:55):**  I mean, maybe the breakfast in cop, maybe something a little different, your trip in  
**[0:35:59-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:35:59):**  Scotland.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:00):**  What has been really surprising, exciting, what you've seen in 2021?  
**[0:36:03-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:03):**  Well, of course, setting up the lab as an independent entity.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:08):**  Spinning it out.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:09):**  I mean, it's a lot of paperwork I can imagine as well.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:10):**  And a lot of work to get it out because you were part of WWF and you're basically a spin-off  
**[0:36:15-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:15):**  now of them, right?  
**[0:36:17-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:18):**  We're the most fantastic team and we're working on 16 landscapes across the planet.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:23):**  I think we worked out that it covers about 85 million hectares, our total portfolio at  
**[0:36:27-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:27):**  the moment.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:28):**  Not that we have much of a footprint in some of them, but that's super exciting and continuing  
**[0:36:35-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:35):**  to help to influence this space.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:38):**  We're doing that with a few partners.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:40):**  So we're combining with Commonland and Wetlands International to create a portfolio of landscapes  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:47):**  to test out carbon investment at landscape scale.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:51):**  We're working with FAO to test out across their portfolio how you get forest landscape  
**[0:36:57-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:36:57):**  restoration working and financed.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:37:00):**  We're working with the European Investment Bank to do a similar peakland program with  
**[0:37:04-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:37:04):**  the government of Ireland for 1.4 million hectares in Ireland and the European Bank  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:37:12):**  for Rural Development, EBRD in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:37:17):**  What's exciting is that portfolio, those portfolios of landscapes I think are amazing.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:37:24):**  That there's so many organizations who each have one, five, 10 landscape programs that  
**[0:37:31-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:37:31):**  can be invested in.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:37:33):**  And if we can all get a common methodology that allows us to talk to each other and share  
**[0:37:39-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:37:39):**  information and grow these landscapes together, then suddenly you've got a landscape industry.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:37:46):**  That feels like it's happening right now.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:37:48):**  This growth of the landscape industry with billions of dollars that will be available  
**[0:37:52-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:37:52):**  to be invested into it.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:37:55):**  After we recorded the episode, I did a bit more research on the Green Bond of Michelin  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:37:59):**  that we discussed that was issued by BMP Paribas and discovered quite a bit of challenges around  
**[0:38:04-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:38:04):**  it and some quite grand accusations of a number of NGOs.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:38:10):**  So I asked Paul for a comment on that and this is what he shared.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:38:13):**  So yeah, there are a whole set of problems that still have to be solved with building  
**[0:38:19-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:38:19):**  landscape programs.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:38:22):**  I'm not sure of the details of the Jambi project with Michelin, but there was certainly an  
**[0:38:28-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:38:28):**  allegation by Mighty Earth that they had cleared their partner, Lestari Pacific had cleared  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:38:35):**  2,500 hectares of rainforest before this program started.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:38:40):**  Now I'm sure that's true and does that negate the program?  
**[0:38:45-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:38:45):**  I don't think it does.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:38:46):**  It means, you know, it says that they've changed their practices and hopefully now with Michelin's  
**[0:38:51-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:38:51):**  commitment to not deforest and not destroy peat lands and so on, that they're now committed  
**[0:38:59-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:38:59):**  to protection and they have the money to do that.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:39:02):**  Now what we're excited about is that money could have gone into further rainforest destruction.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:39:07):**  It hasn't, but we have to keep watching it and make sure that it stays the case.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:39:13):**  Now that raises another problem, which is that genuine landscape programs are built  
**[0:39:18-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:39:18):**  with all of the stakeholders in the landscape and they have a steering group, a landscape  
**[0:39:26-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:39:26):**  partnership that guarantees that everyone's happy with how the program proceeds.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:39:33):**  Now that's been set up in the case of the Jambi project in Sumatra.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:39:39):**  How well it's operating I can't say, but if you have that in place, it makes a big difference.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:39:45):**  What you'll find with many landscape programs or programs that call themselves landscape  
**[0:39:49-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:39:49):**  programs is that they're a loosely connected set of projects within a landscape.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:39:57):**  They're not genuinely looking at the entire landscape, looking at how to protect nature,  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:04):**  how to support local communities and how to make money together.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:08):**  They're more just interested in the investment in the individual projects and they are not  
**[0:40:13-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:13):**  really landscape programs.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:15):**  So that's something to watch out for.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:17):**  I think one of the other challenges is getting the upfront design funds.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:23):**  Many landscapes are slowly developing, investors want to put their money into them, but they're  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:29):**  not willing to pay for the cost of building these programs.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:33):**  That is slow and expensive, but we're seeing some financial instruments coming down the  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:39):**  line that do put that early stage investment costs in.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:44):**  I'd like to see a lot more of that and a lot more investors willing to pay for some of  
**[0:40:49-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:49):**  the costs.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:50):**  Thank you, Paul, so much for that, for sharing the challenges and also the opportunities  
**[0:40:54-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:54):**  and the role of early stage capital.  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:56):**  And now back to the episode.  
**[0:40:58-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:58):**  Two questions on that.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:40:59):**  One, what's the role of normal people?  
**[0:41:01-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:01):**  Like in this sounds like a hundred million here, 250 there.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:05):**  It's a pension fund money, a billion dollar in Switzerland.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:08):**  I mean, this doesn't sound like it's accessible for, like you said, the small people with  
**[0:41:13-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:13):**  normal size wallets, let's say.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:15):**  What do you see?  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:16):**  Is there a role for the crowd or for people in the landscape to partly finance this as  
**[0:41:22-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:22):**  well?  
**[0:41:23-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:23):**  Like if all these Lords in Scotland could participate, I mean, we make the rich a bit  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:26):**  richer as well, but many of us actually are suffering probably because their estates haven't  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:30):**  been profitable in a long time.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:31):**  They just got interesting subsidies, but as an estate level, take out the subsidies, you'd  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:35):**  probably be running on a loss.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:37):**  But what's the role of ordinary, let's say between bracket investors in this space?  
**[0:41:41-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:41):**  Do you see anything exciting there?  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:43):**  Are we too early and is it Bay, Bay party bar issuing this bond from Michelin and we  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:47):**  should be happy and we definitely should be happy about that.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:50):**  Yeah, no, no, there's plenty of role.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:53):**  If you're inside a landscape program, get involved.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:41:58):**  There's always a place for you.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:00):**  And it's so exciting, you know, in, in Australia or Fiji or Columbia or programs developing  
**[0:42:07-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:07):**  in Slovakia, there's always contact the landscape leader and asked to be involved.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:13):**  There'll be a stakeholder group that you can engage with.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:16):**  There'll be lots of studies or promotional activities or things to invest in.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:23):**  So there's every one of these landscapes has a role for the people in them who want to  
**[0:42:27-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:27):**  get active.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:28):**  And then there's a role for supporting these landscapes.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:32):**  You know, invest in landscape.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:36):**  When you see landscape opportunities for investment, invest in them, crowd funding, we do need  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:42):**  early money to make these things work because they're complicated and they're costly at  
**[0:42:46-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:46):**  the beginning.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:47):**  And yeah, I hope there's a, we're still working it out, but I think there's a role for everyone  
**[0:42:52-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:52):**  at different levels in this system.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:55):**  And the second question, how big, I mean, it really depends obviously on the landscape  
**[0:42:58-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:42:58):**  and the context is the risk of climate change.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:00):**  How scared are you that things get out of control and the peatlands dry up completely,  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:05):**  even though you're planting all these trees high up.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:08):**  So the water is stored in the soil.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:11):**  Like how much of a change can we make quickly enough now to restore and to get the landscapes  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:17):**  on an upward slope instead of on a downward slope?  
**[0:43:19-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:19):**  Are you still excited about the potential of regeneration or some landscapes are, I  
**[0:43:24-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:24):**  wouldn't say lost, but it's going to be very, very, very difficult to get life back.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:28):**  I'm hopeful.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:29):**  I mean, the tsunami is coming and if we, if we're not already building the lifeboats,  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:35):**  we're in trouble, but we are, you know, I think I come from Australia.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:40):**  It's, and what's happened with the fires there in the East coast is horrifying.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:45):**  I used to run around the rainforest in Eastern Queensland all the time and I know 300 rainforest  
**[0:43:52-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:52):**  species.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:53):**  I can name 300 rainforest species, but I'm just horrified by how much rainforest has  
**[0:43:59-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:43:59):**  been lost in those fires over the years, which means some species will have disappeared and  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:05):**  the viability of that whole system is really undermined.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:10):**  So we're just recently been approached by a council in North of Sydney who have a million  
**[0:44:17-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:17):**  hectares.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:18):**  They oversee a million hectares that includes the highest, second highest mountain in Australia.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:23):**  This is Barrington Tops, big area of rainforest, Euclid forest with koalas and down to the  
**[0:44:29-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:29):**  coast.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:30):**  And we're looking together at how do you take all of these patches of forest and connect  
**[0:44:35-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:35):**  them together so that the koalas have got a migratory corridor as things get hotter,  
**[0:44:41-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:41):**  they can go further up the mountains and survive.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:44):**  How do you make sure that the water flows, keeps on flowing through the forest and into  
**[0:44:49-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:49):**  the farms?  
**[0:44:50-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:50):**  And that's about through the season.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:51):**  Yeah, that's about planting in the right times.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:54):**  Exactly.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:55):**  And how do you, how do you create incentives for everyone to win from this system?  
**[0:44:59-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:44:59):**  Because if you can do it for that council, you can do it for every council up and down  
**[0:45:03-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:03):**  the East Coast of Australia.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:05):**  And you can maybe, maybe fireproof the Australia for the next generation.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:12):**  That's a chance we have to try for at least, but the ecologists tell us we can do it.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:17):**  And the finances there and the willingness from the, from the local council and the local  
**[0:45:23-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:23):**  government is there.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:25):**  All of the pieces are there to make this happen.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:28):**  And what do you see as the role of technology and we're in this series on technology and  
**[0:45:33-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:33):**  I definitely see technology as a very wide definition.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:36):**  I think financing vehicles are definitely technology as well, but let's zoom a bit deeper  
**[0:45:42-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:42):**  into, cause I see like satellite companies, monitoring companies popping up, drone companies  
**[0:45:46-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:46):**  popping up, I wouldn't say every day, but almost every day.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:49):**  Are you working with any of those?  
**[0:45:50-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:50):**  Are you excited?  
**[0:45:51-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:51):**  Has that changed in the last two years and a half?  
**[0:45:53-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:53):**  Like do you see that central question we try to answer as well?  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:45:56):**  Like what to plant where and why are you using mostly, let's say local indigenous knowledge  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:01):**  of people that know the landscape.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:03):**  Are you working with technology there as well to figure out, cause it's so big, like a million  
**[0:46:06-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:06):**  hectares or whatever the size is, like, do you see a role for tech there to help you  
**[0:46:12-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:12):**  or the landscape to figure out with different scenarios, with different climate scenarios,  
**[0:46:16-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:16):**  et cetera.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:17):**  Okay.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:18):**  What makes sense to do where and why?  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:19):**  Because yeah, we were running out of time, so we need to be very thoughtful of what to  
**[0:46:23-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:23):**  plant or what to make run or walk somewhere.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:27):**  The, our philosophy is landscapes first.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:30):**  So it's got to work for the landscapes first.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:33):**  They have to decide what's going to be useful for them.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:36):**  And let's not, let's first make sure that we're using their knowledge, that, you know,  
**[0:46:42-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:42):**  they're, they're pro, that we don't mess up their systems because that's, that's what  
**[0:46:48-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:48):**  works already.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:50):**  But then there's just massive opportunities to add technology onto this.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:54):**  You know, there's a carbon, it's a bit more than a carbon trading company, a group called  
**[0:46:59-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:46:59):**  Earth Bank in Sweden, who are very cool, run by a guy called Tom Duncan.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:47:06):**  And he used to work for the UNF triple C at a high level.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:47:09):**  So he knows the climate system very well, and he's designed this, this bank to pay landowners  
**[0:47:16-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:47:16):**  directly for carbon outcomes for saving the, saving the climate, doing something on their  
**[0:47:21-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:47:21):**  land for saving the climate.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:47:23):**  He offers a digital monitoring system using the best satellite technology to support them  
**[0:47:29-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:47:29):**  and to verify the, the actions.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:47:30):**  And of course it needs additional verification, but not a lot.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:47:35):**  And to create a system that can work over very large landscapes and very large areas.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:47:41):**  So he's investing in 32,000 farmers in Bangladesh, for instance, he's got an investment into  
**[0:47:47-0:47:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:47:47):**  Peru, into the rainforest of Peru.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:47:51):**  And now we're working together to look at how we can we get this system to work for  
**[0:47:55-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:47:55):**  all of the landscapes that we're operating in.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:47:57):**  That excites me because you know, the ability to bring in machine learning and really simplify  
**[0:48:03-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:03):**  the system for everyone so that the money goes direct to the people in the landscapes.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:11):**  And get it into your pocket through your phone.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:12):**  It wasn't possible 10 years ago and definitely, I mean, you still need a phone, you still  
**[0:48:16-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:16):**  need some internet access, but let's say digital money made it and a lot of these apps made  
**[0:48:21-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:21):**  it a lot easier.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:22):**  And then the monitoring, like transparency here, you can figure out which large cocoa  
**[0:48:26-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:26):**  trader messed up somewhere or has cacao coming in that, that comes from a place that hasn't  
**[0:48:31-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:31):**  been monitored.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:32):**  It's also a bit scary because we have this satellite coming over, but definitely it is  
**[0:48:36-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:36):**  a very fundamental piece if we want to manage the landscape, because we need to know what's  
**[0:48:41-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:41):**  happening and we need to know what's happening in the village.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:45):**  But if the village is the size of landscape, we need to have different ways of observing  
**[0:48:49-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:49):**  and it's crucial.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:50):**  But I think satellite technology has changed a lot over the last years, become much cheaper  
**[0:48:54-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:54):**  and much more accessible and is much faster becoming more accessible.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:48:57):**  And now even with internet beaming down through satellites, it's becoming interesting as  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:01):**  well to, like you said, to live again in a landscape where there's not going to be a  
**[0:49:05-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:05):**  fiber optic cable anytime soon, but you can still have a very decent internet connection.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:10):**  So it helps each other because if there's internet there, of course you can do a lot  
**[0:49:13-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:13):**  more research locally, upload all the data you need, monitor trees, et cetera, et cetera,  
**[0:49:19-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:19):**  and the, or peatlands.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:20):**  Okay.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:21):**  So that I'm definitely going to check out Earth Bank and put the link below as well.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:24):**  Oh, very cool.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:25):**  Very cool.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:26):**  And the big challenge.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:29):**  So if you can measure these things, then you've got a political challenge of what is it that  
**[0:49:34-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:34):**  you're measuring?  
**[0:49:35-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:35):**  And now we've got a pretty clear idea now on carbon.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:38):**  That's that's one real achievement out of the climate conferences.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:42):**  But not on biodiversity.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:44):**  If you ask 10 conservationists, how do you measure biodiversity?  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:47):**  You'll get 10 answers, 10 completely different answers.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:52):**  What are you most excited?  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:53):**  What do you see there as a, I mean, it's difficult to pick, but is it bioacoustics?  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:49:57):**  Is it like listening to the, what do you see as a workable model?  
**[0:50:01-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:01):**  Now you talked about the Swiss that are building a big fund on carbon and potentially then  
**[0:50:05-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:05):**  on biodiversity.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:06):**  What do you now see?  
**[0:50:08-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:08):**  Okay.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:09):**  They're there, or is it still a bit too far away?  
**[0:50:11-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:11):**  It's going to be two, three years before we figured anything measurable and scalable.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:15):**  So not too costly.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:16):**  It's got to be sorted out really quickly.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:19):**  And thankfully gold standard who we've just signed a partnership with IUCN and WWF are  
**[0:50:25-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:25):**  getting combining forces with our range of others to get a clear definition on how you  
**[0:50:31-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:31):**  measure biodiversity, hopefully within a year.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:34):**  Which is super difficult.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:35):**  Let's let's, I mean, we had Satish Kumar on the pod recently and he very clearly made  
**[0:50:41-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:41):**  the point, you cannot measure nature and all its complexity, but still we need to try while  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:45):**  we know that we cannot measure all the complexity, but if we don't measure it's going to be destroyed.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:50):**  So it is there really interesting tension there, but we need to measure something.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:53):**  We need to measure something because otherwise it's just not going to happen unfortunately,  
**[0:50:57-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:50:57):**  or we get an enormous change in consciousness over Christmas this year and then we don't  
**[0:51:01-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:01):**  need it.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:02):**  But for now, we, if it doesn't get measured to get destroyed or sold.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:06):**  And you know, you can measure one thing very easily.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:09):**  That's habitat extent and change.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:11):**  So that's a critical one.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:13):**  You want more natural habitat.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:16):**  Simple as that.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:17):**  What is natural?  
**[0:51:18-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:18):**  Then what is natural habitat?  
**[0:51:19-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:19):**  Well, yeah, right.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:20):**  We won't go into that one.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:23):**  There's something really exciting happening on biodiversity, which is the new DNA testing  
**[0:51:30-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:30):**  tools.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:31):**  There's a company that I met in Glasgow called Nature Metrics.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:34):**  And there's a few other companies like this who will do water testing.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:40):**  You know, you can send school kids out into a landscape and test the water.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:45):**  So they get out.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:46):**  That's good.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:48):**  Do a euro a test.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:49):**  You can tell what's in the landscape.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:52):**  You can say, we want to know what fish species are there.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:54):**  We want to know what primate species are there.  
**[0:51:57-0:51:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:57):**  We want to know what...  
**[0:51:58-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:51:58):**  By measuring, by analyzing the water.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:01):**  Inside those small water samples is all the biodiversity DNA, all the DNA of the biodiversity  
**[0:52:08-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:08):**  of that catchment.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:09):**  And you have to measure it like at the bottom of the catchment.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:12):**  So you capture everything or it's so diffused that that's fascinating.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:16):**  Well, they told me a story in Liberia.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:19):**  They were working with Wildlife Conservation Society and they did a series of samples up  
**[0:52:24-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:24):**  river rivers to see whether the, what was it?  
**[0:52:28-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:28):**  The pygmy hippopotamus was present in those rivers.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:33):**  And they discovered two more rivers that had pygmy hippopotamus that people had no idea  
**[0:52:38-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:38):**  of.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:39):**  And so they extended the range of the pygmy hippopotamus.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:43):**  But you can use this for testing diversity in a forest.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:47):**  For instance, if you're regenerating the forest, you can test how many plant tree species there  
**[0:52:52-0:52:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:52):**  are or how many bird species come in.  
**[0:52:55-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:52:55):**  And on the water and actually, I have heard people say like the best way to, I don't remember  
**[0:53:00-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:00):**  if it was Joe Salatin or somebody else, like the easy or maybe Mark Shepherd, the easiest  
**[0:53:03-0:53:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:03):**  way to test if a farm is going the right direction is to go to the lowest point and capture some  
**[0:53:08-0:53:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:08):**  of the water.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:09):**  If it rains too much, there's some runoff.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:11):**  I mean, not always, but usually, or capture the water that goes flows through the area.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:16):**  Have that analyzed because you can see all the chemicals, you can see all the life.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:18):**  And apparently you can see all the DNA, meaning you can see if the soil life is going up or  
**[0:53:23-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:23):**  down or it's increasing.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:24):**  And it's, yeah, water is very easy between brackets to do because it flows down.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:31):**  It's a much easier connection than the carbon piece or the air piece, et cetera, because  
**[0:53:35-0:53:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:35):**  yeah, it moves in one direction.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:36):**  And that's fascinating.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:38):**  You think for our Australian landscape, this Barrington Coast landscape, you just have  
**[0:53:44-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:44):**  to do a few tests along the river valleys to find out where the koalas are and then  
**[0:53:49-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:49):**  do that every year.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:50):**  And we can test whether the koalas have moved to different habitats.  
**[0:53:53-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:53:53):**  It would be, and it costs next to nothing in the scale of an overall investment in biodiversity.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:01):**  And if you're doing it anywhere, you can get an amount of data from what is happening in  
**[0:54:05-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:05):**  that landscape.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:06):**  If you measure like at the end of the river, when it comes into the ocean, it's, you can  
**[0:54:09-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:09):**  measure anything that happens and you slowly go up and basically figure out, okay, this  
**[0:54:14-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:14):**  is where there's still a farmer doing X, Y, Z, or this is a logging company or this is  
**[0:54:18-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:18):**  because yeah, you can see that.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:21):**  That's very interesting.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:22):**  I don't know, you can see koalas or wildlife in the water.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:26):**  The DNA.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:27):**  Anyway, I have a whole list of new interviews I need to do now.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:31):**  Thank you.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:32):**  So, you know, I've had a few bankers come to me and say that they want to give their  
**[0:54:38-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:38):**  clients, want to give biodiversity credits.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:41):**  They want to give payments to people for improving biodiversity.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:44):**  So, you know, if we can measure it as simply as that, then you can add money.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:51):**  You can add a payment for it.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:52):**  It would be lovely, wouldn't it?  
**[0:54:54-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:54):**  We still have to calculate the value of a koala, but yeah, that's obviously going to  
**[0:54:57-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:57):**  be a lot because I'm so cute.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:54:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:00):**  I've got no idea how this is going to work.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:03):**  We're building the plane as we fly.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:06):**  Thank you so much, Paul.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:08):**  I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:10):**  I know it's not the last time we're going to be chatting.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:12):**  Hopefully it's not going to take two and a half years and another pandemic, which felt  
**[0:55:16-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:16):**  like 10 years to be checking in because so much seems to be happening with 85 million  
**[0:55:20-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:20):**  hectares and 60 landscapes.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:22):**  It's quite a growth curve and some very excited ones.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:25):**  So thank you so much for your work you're doing and for your time today to come on the  
**[0:55:29-0:55:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:29):**  podcast and share the progress.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:31):**  Well, thank you, Kern, for being the Oprah of the regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:36):**  It's going to be a thing now.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:38):**  Thank you, Marcus.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:39):**  Thank you, Paul.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:40):**  Thank you, Paul.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:41):**  Yes, thanks, Paul.

**[0:55:44-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:44):**  Thank you, Paul.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:45):**  Thank you, Paul.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:46):**  It's a great experience.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:48):**  Finance world, this is going to stick, I think, but you really are at the center.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-chatterton-2#t=0:55:49):**  I think you're very useful and your program is very useful to so many of us to inspire

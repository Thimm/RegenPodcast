**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:00):**  You're listening to the summary of the interview. For a link to the full-length episode, please check the description below.  You will listen to an interview with Bert Glover on how he and his team put 160 million to work in regenerative agriculture and food.  Their lessons learned and how we can scale this to the size which is absolutely necessary.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:21):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture â€“ Investing as if the planet mattered.  This is the podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:38):**  while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:50):**  It's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  But at the same time I would love to take this further. Share more interviews, there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:15):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:31):**  For more information please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  And now, without further ado, the interview. Enjoy!  Welcome to another episode of the podcast. I'm Koen van Zeyen, your host and today I interview Brett Glover, co-founder of Impact Ag Partners,  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:48):**  which manages over 150 million Australian dollars in land assets on behalf of international and domestic investors in Australia.  I started to look at, besides financial performance, what else was happening in those ecosystems.  And I guess I soon started to realise that I felt that in some ways economic performance was an outcome.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:12):**  And that outcome was at the cost of the environment and the society, the greater society.  And I felt that there had to be a better way in terms of how we farm.  I quickly understood that, you know, 60% of our farm profit was coming from only 20% of our years.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:32):**  So how could we take out that variability? I was asking questions of our own business around,  how can we take out volatility of our financial performance and how could we reduce the variability in the production of our plants?  And, you know, a lot of that came back to the soil.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:54):**  We really believe that we only borrow our natural assets from our children.  And we believe that, you know, in the production of food and fibre, it shouldn't be at the cost of the environment  and it shouldn't be at the cost of the human race globally.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:12):**  And our objective here is to sit between the financial sector and the operating sector, which is the farming sector,  and help both of those participants deliver better than average, triple bottom line results.  Seeing our consumers and our society saying, we want ethically produced food and fibre  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:38):**  and we have an expectation of you, the farmers, that you're going to do the right thing.  So getting back to Impact Ag Partners, which is six, seven years old, if I'm right, what triggered that to start?  I started to get asked to do external work off-farm in terms of consulting and feasibility studies for third parties.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:58):**  And in that process, I got involved with some larger family offices that were farming here in Australia  that were having some challenges in their business actually.  And they came to me and said, look, can you come and help, you know, work with our team on the ground?  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:15):**  And agriculture is now seen in the family office community as the third greatest sector  where they place their impact funds besides housing and education.  It was the first project, or one of the projects, you say, OK, that's a typical, that's one I'm very proud of.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:35):**  Something you've managed to do in the past few years with Impact Ag Partners.  It was about taking that asset that had been under conventional farming until we purchased it  and then look at it and say, how can we extract better value and how can we take this asset  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:54):**  and have real impact for future generations?  So one way we did that was primarily to change the way the livestock business was being run.  We did a whole suite of measurement when we started the change management.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:09):**  And then probably the third part of major impact was we were asking ourselves the question,  how can we monetise and how can we commercialise some of the impact we're having?  So a way we did that was through a vertically integrated beef business  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:27):**  that helped try to bring more capital back to the farm gate.  We learnt early on that in terms of the red meat space,  consumers in the market we were targeting were quite confused.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:39):**  So there's a whole education process and I think it's one that is still not fully understood.  I still think there's a lot of work to be done there.  I think there's two things that are really exciting at the moment that we're pursuing.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:55):**  The first one is we see more and more opportunity to bring more revenue back to the farm gate  for farmers who are delivering ecosystem services.  And we're seeing environmental finance starting to emerge, which is a little bit like green finance.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:14):**  We're seeing financial products being designed whereby they will help reduce a farmer's interest rates  with related debt to the tune of even up to 100 basis points to reduce their finance costs  if they're delivering measurable ecosystem services.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:35):**  The second initiative that we're working on at the moment is we have a client that has created a new business.  We have a client that has created an impact fund and that fund is purely based around supporting  and demonstrating regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:52):**  It looks across the whole value chain basically.  It's not because a lot of the regenerative funds I see are focused purely on land.  We buy land, we regenerate it, that's where the revenue comes from.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:02):**  But you're mentioning looking at biological fertiliser and looking at technologies.  It almost becomes a sector fund but not just focused on land.  Yeah, it is.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:14):**  One thing that we're working on in the background is the importance of harmonising the metrics  for agricultural impact investments.  So what are all the metrics that we need to capture?  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:27):**  They need to be production, they need to be around financial performance and profit,  but they need to be about the soil metrics, the plant metrics, all the environmental metrics  and then on top there's all the social implications as well.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:44):**  So one of the initiatives we're working on with some other global players from Europe and the US  is about how can we harmonise the metrics that we measure so that if we can help monetise ecosystem services  so that we've got the best farmers farming our land, if we can capitalise those farmers  
**[0:08:05-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:05):**  so that they can get on and drive growth businesses and be prepared to get in and be entrepreneurs  on their land without a noose of long-term debt and free up the capital market.  I think we're really well positioned to achieve all the things that people like you and I want to achieve.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:27):**  What advice would you give to consumers about how to change their mindset?  So I think if consumers can recognise that in the past they've bought food and it's been at relatively low financial cost  but it's been at the cost of the environment, if we can change their mindset from commodity-based food  
**[0:08:47-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:47):**  to premium high-quality nutrient-dense food, clean food, slow food, I think that's when we can really start to capture more change.  If you could change one thing overnight, if you could wave your magic wand  and Bert could change one thing in the agriculture industry or the regenerative ag and food industry?  
**[0:09:09-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:09):**  I think just off the top of my head as you ask that question, if we could reward farmers that were delivering environmental and social good  and help them be rewarded to bring more revenue on-farm so they can reinvest in their assets and reinvest in their businesses.

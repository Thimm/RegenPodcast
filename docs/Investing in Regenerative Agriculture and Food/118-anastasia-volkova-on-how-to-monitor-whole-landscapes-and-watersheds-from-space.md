### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 11 May 2021 17:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:00):**  What is already possible with remote sensing and what isn't?  
**[0:00:04-0:00:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:04):**  For example, you can currently monitor the farming practices and approaches of the whole  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:08):**  Midwest of the United States and see where regenerative agriculture is spreading faster  
**[0:00:13-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:13):**  and slower.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:14):**  And do something about it.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:18):**  Tempering climate change, bringing back rivers, preventing floods and obviously lots and lots  
**[0:00:23-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:23):**  of nutrient-dense food.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:24):**  The promises of Region Egg often sound straight out of a science fiction book.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:28):**  And for these promises to be met, we need to significantly scale regeneration to a  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:33):**  landscape scale within this decade.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:36):**  Welcome to a new series where we look into the technologies needed to bring regeneration  
**[0:00:41-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:41):**  to a landscape scale.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:42):**  In this series, we'll look at already existing technologies, digital tech, ag tech, new financing  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:47):**  mechanisms, etc. that can scale fast enough during the next 10 years.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:52):**  Technologies which put significantly more money into the pockets of farmers, landowners  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:00:56):**  and land stewards who are regenerating their and our soils so they can go faster.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:01:01):**  And we'll ask the question, what is missing?  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:01:03):**  What needs to be urgently developed over the next years?  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:01:07):**  We're very happy with the support for this series by the Grantham Environmental Trust,  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:01:11):**  which supports strategic communications and collaboration in solving the world's most

**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:01:45):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:01:48):**  Welcome to another conversation today with Anastasia Volkova, CEO of Regrow, unlocking  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:01:53):**  the profit potential of resilient agriculture.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:01:56):**  Agriculture has the power to reverse climate change, as we all know.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:01:59):**  Regrow combines the industry leading expertise of Florosat and Dagan to drive resilient agriculture  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:04):**  adoption across the supply chain.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:06):**  Their digital platform combines agronomy and scenario planning for monitoring, reporting  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:11):**  and verification.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:12):**  Welcome Anastasia.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:13):**  Thank you so much, Kon, for having me.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:15):**  And to start with a personal question, how did you end up working on technology and most  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:20):**  importantly on soil?  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:21):**  I don't have a straight answer for you.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:23):**  Take the long answer.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:26):**  I've meandered to get here as a remote sensing engineer.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:30):**  I wanted to work on something that did help our planet.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:33):**  That was definitely one of the goals that I had.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:37):**  And I grew up in a very agricultural country in Ukraine and then studied in Poland, France  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:42):**  and Australia.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:43):**  They're all agricultural countries.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:44):**  So I had the pattern there of being able to see how agriculture is done.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:48):**  I'm a huge foodie.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:50):**  And so I'm seriously interested where the food comes from, even as a remote sensing  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:54):**  engineer.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:02:55):**  And then during my PhD, I've effectively discovered that the technologies I was working on with  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:03:01):**  some of the satellite monitoring and other remote sensing could be used easily in agriculture  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:03:07):**  with very little adaptation.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:03:09):**  And I started digging to understand why aren't they being used.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:03:13):**  And so we focused for the four years of Florosat, pre-recent merger with Dagan, on crop.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:03:20):**  So something that you could do from space with satellites plus economic modeling, you  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:03:27):**  could see the crops, you can see when things go wrong.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:03:30):**  You can also use the information that is a little bit predictive because the sensors  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:03:35):**  and satellites see it earlier than we do with our naked eyes.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:03:39):**  So this is something that's given an important edge to the farmer in terms of being able  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:03:43):**  to respond.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:03:45):**  But then ultimately, we understood that shifting the focus to soil health is more of a long-term  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:03:51):**  game, which is very important.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:03:54):**  And going from a crop, which is pretty annual, sometimes it is a perennial, but it's still  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:03:59):**  an exercise of inputs and outputs.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:04:02):**  Soil health is like a bank you're building across a longer timeframe.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:04:07):**  And when we met Dagan and understood their technologies around soil modeling, we understood  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:04:13):**  that this is where the diamonds are in the soil.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:04:17):**  This is the holy grail.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:04:18):**  And so walk us through the, because you mentioned a lot of obviously relatively technical terms.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:04:23):**  So in the Florosat times, so crop sensing, using satellite imaging, but also obviously  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:04:29):**  more than we can see with the naked eye, you already mentioned that satellites see a lot  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:04:33):**  more than we can see.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:04:35):**  And basically, me as a farmer, I would be having a good overview of my annuals in many  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:04:41):**  cases and seeing where things are on a regular basis going either well or not so well.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:04:48):**  And I could act, there was a management decision there to be made like, okay, I need to focus  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:04:52):**  on that piece of the parcel or that piece of my land, because something like the system  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:04:56):**  is warning me like something is going to happen there or is already happening, even if you  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:00):**  don't see it yet.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:01):**  That's a great summary.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:02):**  That's exactly what it does.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:04):**  And we have automated the manual tasks out of it.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:08):**  So you don't need to look at the imagery or look at the information and see how the weather  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:12):**  correlates with the imagery.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:14):**  We do have agronomic models that look at both of those things and tell you this should be  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:19):**  the growth stage.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:20):**  If you're not seeing that growth stage, maybe something's going not so well.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:24):**  If we're predicting a later growth stage, but we're seeing a earlier growth stage, also  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:30):**  an indication and some deficiency.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:32):**  And we do raise alerts around certain areas of the fields where things seem to not be  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:38):**  going so well, even in most subtle way that you won't be able to see.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:43):**  This is also critically important because this is where usually the disease and pests  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:47):**  come from.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:48):**  And it works in any climate, weather, clouds, non clouds, and regularly because that's,  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:54):**  of course, it can change from week to week and from almost day to day.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:05:57):**  How often I'm a farmer somewhere with this plant monitoring and then we get to the soil  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:03):**  park because that's where the rest of the exciting stuff starts.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:07):**  But it works very regularly or is it how does that how up to date is it and how difficult  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:12):**  it is to get that consistently?  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:14):**  Because that seems to be for me from a non-technical perspective, tricky.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:18):**  But how often does a satellite pass over basically?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:20):**  A couple of times a week or at least once a week, twice a week, depending on where you  
**[0:06:25-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:25):**  are.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:26):**  There are satellites that pass over those fields every day now as well.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:31):**  This is the additional kind of commercial satellite that we could add to the service,  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:36):**  depending on where the farmers are at and how much data do they need, do their crops  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:41):**  need because some crops grow a lot faster than other crops and you have shorter windows  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:47):**  of making decisions.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:49):**  We are still combating clouds as everyone in the industry of using satellite data.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:55):**  But luckily, you can use radar satellites to get through clouds.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:06:58):**  So not only have cameras, but also you have radars that are looking through the clouds  
**[0:07:03-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:07:03):**  that you can interpret the response of that radar satellite and be able to combine it  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:07:11):**  with your optical information to then say, well, here's a consistent picture because  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:07:16):**  we know that the crops are the highest in areas where it rains a lot.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:07:20):**  If it rains a lot, it's very cloudy.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:07:22):**  And this is quite impossible remote sensing, constantly seeing, peering through the clouds  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:07:28):**  and trying to understand how the picture completes what we've seen before the clouds came.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:07:34):**  And so you realize that this plant monitoring was already possible a number of years ago.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:07:40):**  And then do you remember when the of course, when you merged with Dagan, etc.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:07:45):**  But when did you start to be interested or maybe you always were interested in the soil  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:07:49):**  piece of what happens underneath the plants or the annuals and the perennials or what  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:07:53):**  happens on the ground?  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:07:54):**  Do you remember when that got triggered or was it over time?  
**[0:07:58-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:07:58):**  Yes, I would say that was a specific moment when we were growing florescent.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:08:04):**  I definitely was adamant and still am about remote sensing not being a solution to all  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:08:10):**  problems.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:08:11):**  And I believe that process models, so the ability to simulate the entire plant growth,  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:08:17):**  including what's happening in the soil, is going to be that edge that will give our technology  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:08:22):**  the ability to scale globally.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:08:24):**  Because from remote sensing perspective, you can see what's happening, but you need to  
**[0:08:28-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:08:28):**  understand the reasons and what you can change or amend and what effect it likely is going  
**[0:08:35-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:08:35):**  to have.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:08:36):**  To have that if-then-else modeling or scenario planning, you need to have modeling frameworks  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:08:43):**  that allow you to project the behavior of a certain plant.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:08:46):**  And luckily, there are a few out there in the world.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:08:50):**  We were the closest to one from Australia, Agricultural Production Systems Stimulator,  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:08:56):**  APSIM.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:08:57):**  So we started adopting APSIM, and this was the start of my soil journey.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:09:02):**  This was 2018.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:09:05):**  And I started rapidly learning about plant available water, root zone, all of the nutrient  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:09:12):**  availability parameters and how the different soil and depths of soil really impact them  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:09:18):**  and how we might be able to parameterize some of these models.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:09:22):**  Because it's hard to ask the farmer to go and actually calibrate such a model.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:09:27):**  You need to have a better way of delivering the solution to them and ask for way fewer  
**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:09:33):**  inputs from the user.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:09:35):**  We needed to make it much more commercially available, so to speak, through these processes  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:09:40):**  of simplifying it and reducing the number of inputs from the user by inferring more,  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:09:45):**  by looking at the plants and understanding what assumptions we might have gone wrong  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:09:50):**  by getting some of the large scale soil maps.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:09:53):**  This is where it all started, learning about the soil triangle, all those things.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:09:59):**  And so where are you now?  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:10:01):**  We're talking spring 2021.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:10:04):**  What is already possible when it comes to remote sensing and the soil?  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:10:10):**  And then we'll talk about, obviously, what you're developing, what's coming.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:10:13):**  But what's the current status, let's say, in the remote sensing and soil monitoring  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:10:17):**  and soil carbon space and soil health space?  
**[0:10:20-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:10:20):**  Yeah, I would say I was a bit late to understanding the soil game, but even that model, APSIM,  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:10:27):**  has been in development for 30 years.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:10:30):**  So it's something that continuously is being improved by a group of scientists and we're  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:10:34):**  a commercial benefactor of that work and we sometimes contribute to it as well.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:10:39):**  So I would not want to misrepresent that area that has a lot of research, decades of it.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:10:46):**  And similarly, the soil research on soil carbon and greenhouse gas emissions is equally not  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:10:55):**  very young or young on the scale of the age of the universe, probably.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:11:01):**  And in terms of the technology, it's quite old when you think of some software just being  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:11:06):**  a couple of years old, having a few decades on your code, it's a big deal.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:11:10):**  So what's possible?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:11:11):**  What's possible is connecting the measurements of crop parameters that we get from satellites  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:11:18):**  to crop models so we can better understand how the soils need to be parametrized.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:11:23):**  So effectively, we're using plant as a sensor to understand what's happening to the soil.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:11:28):**  But now we're going even further through the addition of the technology from Degan through  
**[0:11:35-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:11:35):**  the recent M&A, what we've added is the DNDC, denitrification decarbonization model.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:11:43):**  Effectively another model, just like the one I described for crops, but for the soil, the  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:11:47):**  one that obsesses with soil microbes and understands in what environment, in what conditions, those  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:11:54):**  soil microbes are going to produce more or less greenhouse gases, and those are also  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:11:59):**  producing the soil organic carbon and helping sequester it, or affecting how much N2O is  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:12:05):**  leaching or how much methane is being emitted if you're planting something like rice.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:12:11):**  So what's possible is how our chief strategy officer says, connecting satellites to soil  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:12:16):**  microbes, understanding what's happening in the soil by observing what's going on with  
**[0:12:21-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:12:21):**  the plant and doing multi-year modeling, and ends up being fairly accurate and hits that  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:12:28):**  sweet spot between having enough accuracy and bound uncertainty and a low cost, which  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:12:34):**  is really important to support a lot of applications we care about in the climate world.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:12:39):**  So basically, you mentioned using the plants as a sensor.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:12:44):**  So you're observing the plant with remote sensing, and with the models, you can now  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:12:50):**  even tell what's going on with a pretty good accuracy, what's happening actually underground  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:12:55):**  in the soil, based still on what the plant is doing or what a plant is reflecting, what  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:00):**  you're seeing with the satellite eyes.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:02):**  Am I going in the right direction or there's more to that?  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:05):**  Yeah, this is part of it, of course.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:08):**  And part of it is being able to model what the human interventions would have been, because  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:12):**  agriculture is pretty standardized.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:14):**  And so we can use some defaults to understand, well, this is roughly what's happening if  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:19):**  it's wheat in Kansas, or if it's corn in Nebraska, or if it's potatoes in Idaho or tomatoes in  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:25):**  California.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:26):**  And by knowing that more traditional way of farming that established itself, we can at  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:32):**  least model a baseline.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:34):**  And then if the farmer has additional information they can add, they could edit in our tool  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:40):**  and get more accurate estimates.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:42):**  But we get to that baseline that is relatively credible and quite useful for very large scale  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:49):**  monitoring quite quickly.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:51):**  And so who is using that large scale monitoring?  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:53):**  What's the client or the partner or whatever you want to call it at the moment?  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:13:57):**  And then we can talk also obviously what's coming.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:14:00):**  But what's the current client interested in large scale monitoring of a lot and a lot  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:14:05):**  of acres, because that's what we're talking about?  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:14:07):**  Yeah, interestingly for our conversations, we would usually start with NGOs.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:14:13):**  So the likes of Nature Conservancy, we love working with Nature Conservancy with other  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:14:18):**  non for profit organizations that really care and understand the concept of we need to measure  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:14:24):**  to manage.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:14:26):**  And even if you know the uncertainty of your measurement, still being able to produce a  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:14:32):**  large scale baseline and understand what's happening in the landscape helps you target  
**[0:14:38-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:14:38):**  your resources and go with your people and training and funding to areas that still need  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:14:45):**  help or understand why they're not adopting good practices that we're able to map using  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:14:51):**  the satellite imagery and then actually estimate their effect using the models.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:14:56):**  So you infer some of the human activity by looking at satellite imagery and this fits  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:02):**  your puzzle of what you're expecting to be happening to the crop.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:07):**  It can be that you're adopting the practices that are good for sequestering carbon.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:11):**  It can be that you have to use some of these practices that are not so good.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:16):**  And you're trying to understand from a nature conservancy perspective, for example, is where  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:21):**  do they deploy resources?  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:23):**  Where are they getting the most progress?  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:25):**  What is the pattern of adoption?  
**[0:15:27-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:27):**  All of those critical questions to be asked.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:29):**  And this is what helps us create that larger scale baseline whilst of course we have customers  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:35):**  across the agri-food supply chain that then look at the more regional supply chains on  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:41):**  their own.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:42):**  And so I think you touch upon a very important piece, like how do we bring this regeneration  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:47):**  and regenerative approaches to a landscape scale or to a much larger scale?  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:51):**  And maybe the first movers there are the nonprofits like TNC and that have a landscape approach.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:15:58):**  Do you have an example of somewhere you are applying that, like basically monitoring a  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:16:03):**  lot of farmers in a landscape or an ecosystem and then helping someone to, let's say focus  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:16:09):**  their limited resources, even if they're a large organization like TNC, to focus their  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:16:13):**  resources on specific farmers or specific areas or specific parts of the watershed,  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:16:18):**  et cetera.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:16:19):**  And then focus through an example of a landscape approach there.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:16:22):**  Yeah, I can give you a couple of examples there.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:16:24):**  So we have mapped the conservation practice adoption and its soil health outcomes for  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:16:31):**  entire Midwest, upper Midwest.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:16:34):**  So it's many, many states and we've mapped it 15 years back because this is what we need  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:16:40):**  to have baselines of carbon sequestration.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:16:43):**  And we are on an ongoing basis adding on an annual basis, new data products to it.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:16:49):**  So basically following in the whole Midwest, let's say the application of no-till, which  
**[0:16:54-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:16:54):**  came up in that time, cover crops, which came up in some place.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:16:57):**  And you can basically say, okay, in the last 15 years in X percent of the acreage, there's  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:17:04):**  this and this has been applied in X percent.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:17:06):**  And we model the outcome in terms of carbon, in terms of nitrogen, less nitrogen leaks,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:17:11):**  hopefully not the other way around, and or more.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:17:14):**  And basically do a sort of status report over the last 15 years because you have to the  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:17:19):**  satellite data for the last 15 years.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:17:21):**  I'm imagining you cannot go back further, but still 15 years is a long time.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:17:25):**  You can see what are the most surprising changes you have seen in terms of practices and then  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:17:30):**  outcome in a huge area like the Midwest.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:17:33):**  And I just wanted to add that we are going to get it to the national scale this year.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:17:38):**  And we're going to continue producing the national scale baseline.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:17:42):**  So quite exciting times, a lot of work, but very exciting work.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:17:47):**  And indeed, imagine the map and map that shows you on the crop reports and district scale  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:17:52):**  or watershed scale or going deeper into the county scale or all the way to the field level.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:17:58):**  You can zoom in and you can zoom out all the way to the state level and see what states  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:18:03):**  are adopting a mix of conservation practices, adopting no-till, adopting cover crops, and  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:18:09):**  in what areas we need a lot more support.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:18:12):**  So there is one of the trends that we're seeing that not all areas around the area, Great  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:18:17):**  Lakes are equally adopting those practices.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:18:19):**  And we understand there are some challenges with it and those challenges need to be solved.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:18:24):**  Agronomically, we need to think of better ways of managing cover crops, of adopting  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:18:29):**  no-till.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:18:31):**  This is where we see clearly colored targets on the map where we need to deploy our efforts.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:18:37):**  You see the lagging places.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:18:39):**  And do you also see the example farms as well?  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:18:43):**  The ones that we hear about?  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:18:44):**  Or do you see, wow, this piece, I'm just saying green, not because it could be.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:18:49):**  Do you see something that really stands out in terms of practices and outcome?  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:18:55):**  Do you see those examples or is it you cannot zoom enough to really understand almost on  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:19:00):**  the farm level where you see like, okay, let's go and figure out what he or she is doing  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:19:03):**  there because this is not something we expect to happen in that area or something that's  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:19:08):**  out of the ordinary?  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:19:09):**  Yeah, a good example of that would be the partners that TNC works with, maybe extension  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:19:15):**  agents or even checkoffs.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:19:17):**  The organizations for all of non-American listeners, the organizations that are getting  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:19:22):**  paid by farmer tax dollars from their local at the state level, they are funding a lot  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:19:28):**  of this research and we are working with several organizations, farm organizations or checkoffs  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:19:34):**  to help deploy this technology on very local scale as well as on the broader scale for  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:19:41):**  monitoring across the entire, say, federal program of that checkoff.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:19:46):**  And what you're finding is we are mapping those fields at an acre by acre level.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:19:53):**  So we can see what's happening even in a subfield level.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:19:55):**  And if, for example, if half of the field is managed differently all the time, we'll  
**[0:19:59-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:19:59):**  be able to pick it up.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:00):**  We're not going to just be tied to the field boundary that we're seeing.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:05):**  We will actually look at what is the consistent crop mask, so to speak, like what is the area  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:11):**  that is consistently managed there?  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:14):**  So when you think of it from a perspective of a checkoff, for example, that is similar  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:18):**  to TNC but more of a local perspective, what they would like to understand is who are some  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:23):**  of the farmers where it is working, maybe there are some areas, some counties where  
**[0:20:27-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:27):**  it's working better.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:28):**  Go and talk to the local population, understand if there are champions of this approach.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:33):**  Very often that is the case.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:35):**  Someone who's able to provide technical assistance, the support in adoption of these practices,  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:40):**  answer questions.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:41):**  How can we scale those local grassroots communities that can support many more of their neighbors  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:46):**  in adopting these practices?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:47):**  This is what you're usually seeing.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:49):**  So in a way, by looking at that landscape and the rate of adoption, you can see who  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:54):**  can you leverage as much as who needs that support the most.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:20:59):**  You can get like this spillover effect.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:01):**  You can find the ones, the nuts that are growing fastest.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:06):**  And hopefully leverage them to help those who are still not so sure about adoption.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:12):**  It's a different way of farming.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:13):**  It looks different.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:14):**  It's not a clean black piece of land over winter.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:19):**  That's why you can see the difference.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:21):**  From above.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:22):**  That's one of the, yeah, no, it looks and feels, it's very different.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:25):**  I think there's some research, I don't remember the exact term, calling it something like  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:29):**  the organic spillover effect.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:30):**  Like if you saw somebody growing organic in a county, then very, if they were successful,  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:36):**  obviously you saw that others like neighbors were starting to adopt it and you had this  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:39):**  sort of oil spill happening and probably you can see that from space.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:44):**  You can actually watch that adoption happening over time because they do a very different  
**[0:21:47-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:47):**  farming compared to their neighbors.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:49):**  And then maybe the neighbors start to do something similar.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:51):**  And then you see that spreading, which in terms of how do we scale this over the next  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:55):**  decade and a half or decade is extremely valuable information.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:21:59):**  It's true.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:00):**  You're right.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:01):**  Understanding the adoption patterns and understanding the challenges.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:03):**  And some of the regenerative farmers are talking about still being few in their area, although  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:09):**  they've been talking to their neighbors about it for a long time because of the social stigma  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:13):**  of, well, you have spider webs in your cover crop over winter.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:18):**  This is not a good look, you lazy farmers.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:20):**  Whilst actually they're keeping the living root in the soil all year round, they are  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:26):**  really bolstering the ecosystem and biodiversity of their crops to help pollinators, to help  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:33):**  the soil environment to be more enriching for all of the little critters that we see  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:38):**  and cannot see.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:39):**  Like the spiders.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:40):**  Even those that are micro size that we can't see with our eyes.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:45):**  It's an important ecosystem.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:47):**  And I think farming is a management of an ecosystem and it's a very different generational  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:54):**  shift that is required.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:22:55):**  And we're seeing a lot more, a trend of course, in seeing the newer generation wanting to  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:02):**  come back to farm and actually shift the gears to more generative production.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:06):**  I think it's a very important trend because you have people coming in who do not have  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:11):**  the stigmas of how it used to be, or if they have seen it being done, they understand the  
**[0:23:17-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:17):**  climate urgency a lot more than just conforming with the norm of the certain stereotypical  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:23):**  farming.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:24):**  And so what is, let's say, paint us a picture over the next years.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:27):**  You say we have a lot of work to do.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:29):**  This is possible now.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:30):**  What will be possible in a year's time, in a few years' time?  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:34):**  Like what do you see?  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:35):**  Obviously, we're not going to help you accountable in 12 months exactly.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:38):**  It should be that.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:39):**  But what do you see coming in terms of technology, but also in terms of other movements as you're  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:45):**  such a central piece of the remote sensing and more?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:48):**  What's going to happen over the next 12, 24, maybe even more months, basically, that's  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:54):**  suddenly going to make things possible that we didn't know were possible before?  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:58):**  Or not?  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:23:59):**  Maybe we have everything and we just need to implement it.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:00):**  That's also possible.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:01):**  No, there's still some science that we're developing.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:05):**  And I would say the way to think of motivating and rewarding farmers to be good stewards  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:12):**  of an ecosystem is what we're calling ecosystem service markets now.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:18):**  So being able to be paid for additional soil carbon use sequestered.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:22):**  And we think soil carbon is only the tipping point of the iceberg, where in the next few  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:27):**  years, what we will see is more credits for water stewardship, for biodiversity, for other  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:33):**  things on the farm, for of course, nutrients, for application, for sparing application of  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:38):**  fertilizer.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:39):**  So seeing that unfold is something that I'm really looking forward to.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:44):**  And we're looking forward to supporting.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:46):**  Literally seeing it unfold.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:47):**  Yeah, that's your role.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:49):**  And like biodiversity and let's say water.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:51):**  Is that something that is already possible to observe remotely, basically, either directly  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:56):**  or through models?  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:58):**  Yeah, great point.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:24:59):**  So this is actually something that is on the chopping board of our R&D team.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:25:03):**  They are working on it fairly actively.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:25:05):**  As I said, the science in this space is evolving.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:25:08):**  And so we know that we can identify some of the, for example, edge of field practices  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:25:13):**  and map them and being able to make use of those to characterize a property that is being  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:25:18):**  farmed as the one that follows stewardship parameters that we expect.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:25:24):**  And when you think of this, imagine a farm next to a river and they have riparian areas  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:25:32):**  that they've conserved, like the little wetlands or the little kind of strip of forest between  
**[0:25:39-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:25:39):**  the edge of field and the water.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:25:41):**  And this is actually something that clearly will improve the water quality as being able  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:25:47):**  to detect it and as being able to model the outcomes.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:25:51):**  Once again, follows this pattern of do as much information collection from the satellite  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:25:56):**  because realistically, the producers do not have the time for it, as well as it's very  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:01):**  hard to standardize when you're, let's imagine we would drive out to a farm in your local  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:05):**  neighborhood and they would ask you, well, how much do you think that windbreak is saving  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:11):**  them an erosion or that riparian area is helping them with sediment filtering?  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:16):**  Like neither of us would be able to answer that question.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:19):**  What would you even measure?  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:21):**  What would you even, where do you even start?  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:22):**  Exactly.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:23):**  With a tape measure running around your trees.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:26):**  I'm not sure.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:28):**  So this is where that bird's eye view really helps and being able to quantify the outcomes  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:33):**  is something that we're really focusing on now and understanding with what accuracy we  
**[0:26:38-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:38):**  can do it.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:39):**  But we're really passionate about bringing this more holistic approach to understanding  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:42):**  ecosystems so that now what I think we will see the shift from is now we're farming for  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:48):**  the yield because there is limited number of incentives to farm for the environmental  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:54):**  practices in the US.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:56):**  In Europe, for example, the situation is different.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:26:58):**  In New Zealand, the situation is different.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:00):**  In the UK, it seems to be switching very quickly now.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:02):**  There's some very interesting space now.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:04):**  And do you see that the others in the next couple of years, also in the US and other  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:07):**  places probably there will be more incentives.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:10):**  What I hear is that there are a lot of incentives, but it's very, very difficult to access or  
**[0:27:15-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:15):**  very burdensome or many don't even bother with it because it's the paperwork, the proofing,  
**[0:27:22-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:22):**  etc, etc.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:23):**  There's actually a lot available from public authorities, local, regional, state, country,  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:29):**  but many of that either goes to very, very big corporations.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:32):**  What we see here in Europe, most of the gap money, the public money coming from Brussels  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:36):**  goes to very, very large farms that are not the most environmentally friendly to say the  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:41):**  least, but it usually doesn't get to the most innovative or to the interesting ones.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:45):**  Is that something that technology can help with or what do you see there?  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:50):**  Actually we're seeing a number of startups also coming up in this space in the US specifically,  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:55):**  those that effectively help prequalify the farmer.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:27:58):**  And currently it's more done from the manual perspective.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:01):**  But to be honest, this is something that Regrow does for some of our customers.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:06):**  We run eligibility analysis because we have the landscape baseline and we understand who  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:13):**  needs it the most and how they stand against the benchmark.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:16):**  And often it's that comparison with a benchmark that determines your eligibility for a particular  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:20):**  area.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:21):**  For example, they want to boost the adoption to a certain extent and hence they will be  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:26):**  continuing to invest funds based on that adoption rate that you need to effectively demonstrate  
**[0:28:31-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:31):**  yourself against.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:33):**  I wouldn't say that big ag is bad.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:36):**  I definitely don't believe that.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:37):**  I don't believe that the larger firms are always not environmentally friendly.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:42):**  I think that is unsustainable and I think they do want to be sustainable.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:46):**  I would say the non-diversified operations are less sustainable simply because they can't  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:52):**  have enough circularity on their own farm.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:28:56):**  But this is simply a product of society wanting a lot of the same things at an enormous volume.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:02):**  And I think when we reverse that, and this is the whole discussion of being able to shift  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:08):**  to plant-based meats so that we don't have to allocate 70% of our land to cattle production  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:13):**  and have more mixed farms that are a bit more maybe boutique.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:16):**  Actually to cattle feed production.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:18):**  That's even the indirectness and the waste.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:20):**  You can see that probably over the last 50 years, that spread and that growth in basically  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:25):**  cattle feed, which in all aspects doesn't make any sense.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:30):**  But what I think is interesting, do you also switch it to the other side?  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:33):**  Do you get questions from like, how can we, I wouldn't say punish using the word, but  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:38):**  how can we, of course we want to pay for positive outcomes, but if I then end up anyway plowing,  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:45):**  like what's the checks and balances there and do you see that market going there as  
**[0:29:49-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:49):**  well?  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:50):**  Like you're not allowed to do this and this practices.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:52):**  And if you do, actually there's a fee and we're monitoring you or is that a tricky area  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:56):**  to go into?  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:29:57):**  I think we need to understand first and foremost that in different areas, different practices  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:30:01):**  make sense and the local variability is actually quite large.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:30:07):**  So you might go from a field to a field and you have completely different scenario with  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:30:10):**  soil compaction and you have to disturb that soil somehow to be able to work that soil.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:30:16):**  And of course you need a longer term plan on how you're improving that soil texture,  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:30:22):**  aeration and getting rid of compaction.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:30:26):**  So of course longer term, it needs to be something different.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:30:28):**  But I would say generally authorities are careful with the stick approach to agriculture  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:30:35):**  because it's not a one size fits all industry at all.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:30:39):**  And what we're seeing in the US is more voluntary private markets.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:30:43):**  So it's a lot of carrot and incentive, which is important because if we still have so much  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:30:48):**  carrot and incentive and we do not see enough adoption, we definitely need to get the balance  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:30:54):**  right.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:30:55):**  And I would say when you think of incentives, the numbers actually matter because we are  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:00):**  the ones who count the numbers.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:01):**  We offer the scenario planning tools to the farmers with the ROI.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:06):**  And I would say it doesn't make a huge difference financially to them.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:11):**  It makes some over the long run their own soil health and reduction in the need to use  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:17):**  chemicals and other additional inputs on the farm is what makes the most difference.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:23):**  So it's less of this government payment, which effectively we see it as a kickstarting payment  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:27):**  to bridge some of the risk that they have to take on because the yield will dip a little  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:32):**  bit in the first year.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:34):**  But then over the three, five year horizon, really being able to see the return.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:39):**  But how would you build to in the system where the farmers incentivized for their annual  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:44):**  production volume?  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:45):**  How would you without that incentive even being able to bridge that gap?  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:49):**  That's one view a bit more capitalistic as someone who grew up in Europe and lived in  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:53):**  Australia and worked also with New Zealand farmers.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:31:56):**  I see a flip side of the coin of more of the socialistic approach to it, as well as more  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:32:03):**  kind of a little bit more government heavy in involvement.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:32:06):**  I think fragile ecosystems like New Zealand, the fact that they manage it very strictly  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:32:12):**  and we have a solution in New Zealand that they use for monitoring of their nitrogen  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:32:18):**  leaching and of their carbon footprint at the scope one and scope three.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:32:22):**  So we actually have more advanced solution in New Zealand that we have in the US because  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:32:26):**  they've been such an early adopter for a number of years.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:32:30):**  And what we're seeing there is the local authority that supports the farmers wants to bring them  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:32:35):**  the tools so that they can see their impact and they can continue to have their license  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:32:40):**  to farm, not because of the approach of we want a stick or a carrot.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:32:45):**  We want transparency and we want everyone to be part of this ecosystem so that the farmers  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:32:50):**  doesn't get exempt from activities allowed in that watershed in New Zealand where they  
**[0:32:55-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:32:55):**  have great yields, but also close to beautiful rivers and other fragile environments.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:02):**  And do you see things like that coming, let's say, to the US?  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:05):**  We hear a lot about the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:08):**  We know it comes from nitrogen leaching, or at least that's understood.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:12):**  Can you trace that back to, OK.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:14):**  Let's say we want to fix it because it sounds very engineering, but we want to make sure  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:19):**  that that doesn't happen because of the huge environmental cost, the huge social and financial  
**[0:33:24-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:24):**  costs as well for the whole fishing industry there and a lot more.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:27):**  And so can you then trace that back?  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:29):**  Is it already possible?  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:30):**  OK, what are the areas of which farms, which counties should we really focus our attention  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:36):**  on the in this case, the nitrogen leaching or on the practices to make sure that that  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:41):**  doesn't go into the beautiful river or non beautiful river and ends up in the sea?  
**[0:33:44-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:44):**  Is that something that you get requests from?  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:46):**  Like, OK, let's connect the dots between huge environmental issue, huge economic issue for  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:52):**  the Gulf of Mexico and actually far away farmers and land stewards that are somehow influencing  
**[0:33:58-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:58):**  that obviously negatively.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:33:59):**  Is that something that's happening or is that something for the future?  
**[0:34:02-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:02):**  You're spot on.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:03):**  We do have customers working on this.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:05):**  It's oftentimes the non for profit or foundations.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:08):**  We have, for example, a large scale project with entire Mississippi River and understanding  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:13):**  what goes into it, like monitoring the entire watershed and seeing where the additional  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:17):**  nitrogen can be, so to speak, added, which is a massive watershed just for anybody doesn't  
**[0:34:22-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:22):**  know the map of the US.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:24):**  That's a very big watershed.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:26):**  And being able to really identify where some of the areas where either the state governments  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:30):**  or the federal funding needs to be directed to be able to improve practices is really  
**[0:34:36-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:36):**  something you can be doing.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:38):**  And I think local governments do that well when they understand their own contributaries  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:43):**  to their watershed.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:44):**  So, for example, I've heard in the New York state, the farmers in the upstate New York  
**[0:34:49-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:49):**  getting paid to manage their inputs more sparingly so that the water quality in New York City  
**[0:34:57-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:57):**  gets better.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:34:58):**  And this is a very financial transaction where you motivate people with the real dollar,  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:04):**  which goes a long way in this country, to change the way they do things because you  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:09):**  really see the value of it.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:10):**  And I think the more value we start transferring back to the farm for ecosystem services, this  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:16):**  is where I think we will change the environment, at least for that 19 percent of the greenhouse  
**[0:35:21-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:21):**  gases that agriculture contributes.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:23):**  And I want to make clear that the majority of that is livestock.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:26):**  It's not cropping.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:27):**  But still, as we discussed, the majority of crops are grown as feed to livestock.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:31):**  This is the whole system we need to fix.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:33):**  And it's interesting, the examples you mentioned are in water.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:37):**  And I always wonder if that's an easier one because it is, I mean, it is easier to track.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:42):**  Like if I something leaks into a river here, it's going to end up at the end of the river  
**[0:35:46-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:46):**  in the sea at some point.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:48):**  And somehow that seems to be because this example, I will try to find a link to it,  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:52):**  is actually, I think, more than a decade old in New York where they had to not build another  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:35:56):**  filter installation because they were working with farmers upstate and upriver upstream,  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:01):**  basically, to not leak as much and not use as much to actually apply regenerative practices  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:06):**  or at least more conservation agriculture.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:08):**  And it saved them an enormous amount of money and not building another filter installation  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:11):**  for drinking water.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:13):**  And somehow these examples always end up being about water and not yet about, I mean, carbon  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:16):**  is coming.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:17):**  But water seems to be that it seems an easier, easier line to follow, basically, from cause  
**[0:36:22-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:22):**  to effect.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:23):**  I think it's just because water is something that we actually drink.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:26):**  We buy water, it's bottled.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:28):**  A lot of people come from places where you can't drink tap water and you appreciate it.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:34):**  You also see a lot of fires and lack of water and the environment.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:38):**  So you're definitely getting a sense of us depleting.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:41):**  I think it's closer to us.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:42):**  Yeah, yeah, I think it's a lot closer.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:45):**  It's a lot, it's palpable.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:46):**  If you've ever been stuck on a hike without a water bottle, without something to drink,  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:51):**  you feel like you're dying right there and then.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:54):**  And carbon is not something you can really taste or feel.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:36:59):**  Nitrogen you can't die.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:37:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:37:01):**  And something that, I mean, nitrogen contributes to the water quality and those effects.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:37:06):**  But with carbon, we're feeling that, okay, well, CO2, car exhaust smells bad, but how  
**[0:37:12-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:37:12):**  do I know what part of it is CO2?  
**[0:37:14-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:37:14):**  And how do I know how much I'm actually meeting?  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:37:16):**  It's nice to have cleaner, greener energy sources as well as appliances.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:37:22):**  But realistically, like we even were talking with my husband recently, looking at a massive  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:37:29):**  truck passing up the highway, how many dinosaurs per second is it burning in terms of the oil?  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:37:36):**  And this is something that's truly thought that I don't think passes everyone's mind  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:37:41):**  on every day basis.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:37:43):**  So carbon is a lot harder for us, but as long as we focus on the fact that it's 51 billion  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:37:49):**  tons, we need to remove them, certain amount comes from energy, certain amount comes from  
**[0:37:54-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:37:54):**  transport, certain amount comes from agriculture, and we need to get to work.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:37:57):**  And even our diets is something that can materially change it.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:02):**  And we do not have as much time as we would need.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:05):**  And the Gen Z, new generations, of course, they're willing to change their choices, but  
**[0:38:11-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:11):**  we need a change to happen before Gen Z becomes the middle class spending a lot of money.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:19):**  We need the change to happen in the next 10 years.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:22):**  I always like to ask this question inspired by John Kempf.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:24):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't?  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:28):**  So where are your contrarian?  
**[0:38:30-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:30):**  And then we get to the speed as well, like what needs to happen, etc.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:33):**  But I like to hear your answer of where you think different within RegenAg.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:37):**  I think my opinion of RegenAg, and we're going to scratch the surface of that opinion, is  
**[0:38:41-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:41):**  that I think it is not going to be as standardized as you would want it to be.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:46):**  It's not going to be just like organic, that there's a certain recipe and as long as you  
**[0:38:51-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:51):**  follow the recipe, you could be certified as organic.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:54):**  I think because we have different grounds, because farms are coming from different systems,  
**[0:38:59-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:38:59):**  we will have to measure the ecosystem outcomes and focus on the outcomes, not on the tools  
**[0:39:07-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:39:07):**  to get to those outcomes.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:39:09):**  And I think that's what makes the mandating of regenerative agriculture challenging.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:39:15):**  This is what makes unification of those standards a bit more challenging.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:39:20):**  But I'm sure that we will see countries, states starting to adopt certain standards on what  
**[0:39:26-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:39:26):**  they would want to measure.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:39:27):**  We're working a lot with California, their view board, they're quite progressive, and  
**[0:39:33-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:39:33):**  they're really already monitoring a number of systems across crops and dairy with us.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:39:40):**  And we're seeing that they're pioneering some of the statewide work of how do you do this  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:39:45):**  accounting across your landscape and ecosystem.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:39:49):**  And they understand that this is not something one size fits all.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:39:52):**  So my contrary view is that it's not going to be as simple as the label organic.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:39:57):**  It's going to be something that will have to be catered, tailored, but we need to first  
**[0:40:01-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:40:01):**  and foremost not focus, oh, tilling is bad.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:40:04):**  Well, in some cases you have to till to farm.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:40:07):**  And in some cases, if we even talk about organic farming for just a second, it's a lot of tilling.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:40:13):**  It's a lot of tilling because you need to get rid of those weeds.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:40:18):**  And whether we all, consumers of organic, who want to improve the nutrition benefits,  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:40:25):**  make sure that there's less chemistry in our food, suddenly stop and think of how much  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:40:30):**  more CO2 that current method is emitting.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:40:34):**  I'm not sure if you would be more open-minded to GMOs as a result because in reality they're  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:40:40):**  not such a problematic thing.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:40:42):**  So agriculture is complex and really seeing what effects certain consumer choices make,  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:40:48):**  I think is something very practical that every listener can really dive a little bit deeper  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:40:53):**  into understanding what has happened for that food to be delivered to their plate.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:40:59):**  And if you could change one thing overnight, like you have a magic wand, there's, you have  
**[0:41:03-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:03):**  an unlimited power.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:04):**  What would that be?  
**[0:41:05-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:05):**  It could be on the technology piece.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:06):**  It could be, okay, we're really missing this magic, I wouldn't say trick, but this technology,  
**[0:41:12-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:12):**  that good technology always seems like magic.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:14):**  It's the first time you see it, but it could be something else completely.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:18):**  Could be global consciousness.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:19):**  Could be what you just mentioned.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:21):**  If we dig a bit deeper into that, what would you change if you have that magic power to  
**[0:41:25-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:25):**  change one thing overnight?  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:26):**  I'm going to say something very controversial.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:29):**  I would put strict restrictions around fertilizer use in all agricultural areas.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:36):**  I think because we are on this nitrogen drug, we are getting more and more into unreasonable  
**[0:41:44-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:44):**  yield demands.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:45):**  We are not restoring the soil.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:47):**  We're not letting the soil restore itself.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:49):**  We're not looking into practices that people get to when they do not have as much money  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:55):**  to buy synthetic fertilizer.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:41:57):**  And I think as big as that industry is, we need to start dismantling that stronghold  
**[0:42:03-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:03):**  somehow.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:06):**  Of course, they will reprofile.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:07):**  Of course, they understand it's coming, but it's like an oil industry situation.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:12):**  You know that the fact that it's cheap and the fact that it has a sunset to it, it has  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:17):**  a horizon, just doesn't feel right.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:21):**  Those two things, it has to be more expensive because of the cost of externalities that  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:25):**  we're absolutely not accounting for.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:27):**  So that would be my radical magic wand move.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:32):**  And you would monitor it, I assume.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:34):**  Yes, because I want the water to remain clean and I want the soil health to have a chance  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:39):**  to restore itself.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:40):**  And it's very challenging when you're on the constant treadmill of add more nitrogen, get  
**[0:42:46-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:46):**  more yield.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:47):**  And I do think there's a lot of connected inventions that we would rely on, even in  
**[0:42:53-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:53):**  dwarfing our crops, making our corn smaller so that we don't have to feed it so much nitrogen  
**[0:42:58-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:42:58):**  so it can grow into a smaller plant with the same yield.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:01):**  Something that happened to wheat many years ago and won a Nobel Prize.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:06):**  So there's my magic wand move implies probably 50 inventions that we need to make it possible.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:13):**  But I would love for that to be something that does get a lot more attention and more  
**[0:43:19-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:19):**  strict monitoring around it.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:21):**  Which actually is a great bridge to the next question.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:24):**  So let's say you have a large investment fund, let's say a billion, a billion dollars to  
**[0:43:29-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:29):**  invest those 15 inventions or whatever it's needed.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:32):**  Where would you how would you prioritize if you would be running from tomorrow morning  
**[0:43:37-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:37):**  an investment fund purely focused on, let's say, ag food?  
**[0:43:41-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:41):**  I mean, you can focus on other things as well.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:42):**  If you want to diffusion, I'm okay with that.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:44):**  But how would you prioritize if you would be a large scale investor with a very long  
**[0:43:49-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:49):**  time horizon if you want to?  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:50):**  Obviously, that doesn't have to be paid back in a couple of years, you have the flexibility,  
**[0:43:54-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:54):**  but it is an investment fund.  
**[0:43:55-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:55):**  So we're looking for investments.  
**[0:43:57-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:57):**  What would you prioritize?  
**[0:43:58-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:58):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:43:59-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:43:59):**  I actually spoke to such a fund yesterday.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:44:01):**  So this is easy.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:44:02):**  And I think what they're doing is actually right.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:44:05):**  I think you need to invest in decarbonisation of economy.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:44:08):**  And it does come down if you dig deep enough to certain inventions that you need.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:44:15):**  And when it comes to agri food specifically, in that sector, something that I mentioned,  
**[0:44:20-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:44:20):**  you need to invest in breeding, very long time horizon, breeding of plants that are  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:44:26):**  more suitable for our climate changed future.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:44:30):**  Even if we don't warm up by all the degrees that we can, we still will have plants that  
**[0:44:36-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:44:36):**  we'll need to adopt.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:44:38):**  Also potentially even breeding plants for alternative diets.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:44:42):**  So that not only we start consuming plant based diet, but we actually, if we focus on  
**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:44:48):**  this concept of needing an input into the system, a source product that will go through  
**[0:44:54-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:44:54):**  a completely different sourcing and processing, that changes the source ingredient itself.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:45:00):**  So if you really commit to shifting the world to plant based diet, as some of those large  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:45:06):**  failed funded startups are doing, I think it's important for combating the climate change  
**[0:45:11-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:45:11):**  problem.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:45:12):**  So we need to invest in bringing of varieties and crops that are more drought tolerant as  
**[0:45:19-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:45:19):**  people are doing, the worked varieties.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:45:21):**  So we spend less resources on growing what we actually need to grow.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:45:25):**  I would also spend time on modelling.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:45:28):**  I would spend time on collecting the data at a very large scale.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:45:32):**  So funding someone like us to be able to, even with the bound uncertainty, produce an  
**[0:45:39-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:45:39):**  estimate of how are we going.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:45:41):**  Because if we don't have a finger on the pulse of this matter, it seems like even if we're  
**[0:45:47-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:45:47):**  doing something great, we're not achieving that much.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:45:50):**  And we're not focusing our energy and attention where it needs to be.  
**[0:45:53-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:45:53):**  And then ultimately understanding how we're actually looking after these ecosystems and  
**[0:46:00-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:46:00):**  being able to, some of the technologies that we haven't talked about that are equally important  
**[0:46:05-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:46:05):**  is precision and alternative weeding, for example, or avoiding to apply so much chemistry  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:46:12):**  on your plants.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:46:13):**  Like those are other technologies that I think deserve to be funded and well funded so that  
**[0:46:18-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:46:18):**  we are going to reap the benefit of cleaner crops.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:46:22):**  And last but not least, advancing majority of these technologies to the developing world.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:46:28):**  This is something that is quite hard to do with just private funds when you're trying  
**[0:46:33-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:46:33):**  to look for revenue as a small startup, for example, but funding innovations in that space  
**[0:46:39-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:46:39):**  and being able to have a longer time horizon for holding those investments, I think can  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:46:44):**  make substantial benefits to people who need it the most.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:46:48):**  I want to thank you so much for your time today.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:46:51):**  Be conscious of your time as well and sharing a few insights.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:46:54):**  We just scratched the surface.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:46:56):**  So we definitely need to do this again in terms of what is already possible with technology  
**[0:47:00-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:47:00):**  on the landscape scale, what should be possible and what will be possible in the near future.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/anastasia-volkova#t=0:47:05):**  Thank you so much for joining us and hope to repeat it at some point.

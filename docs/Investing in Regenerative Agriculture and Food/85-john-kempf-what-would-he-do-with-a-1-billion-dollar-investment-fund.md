**[0:00:19-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:00:19):**  pests and disease issues.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:00:20):**  We talk about his book, his work on developing an AI agronomist to make Regen-egg advice  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:00:25):**  accessible to all farmers anywhere, everywhere, and how to nudge farmers to observe better  
**[0:00:30-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:00:30):**  and ask more questions.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:00:32):**  And finally, how would John put a $1 billion investment fund to work?  
**[0:00:37-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:00:37):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:00:39):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture â€“ Investing as  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:00:43):**  if the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:00:47):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:52-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:00:52):**  soil, people, local communities, and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:00:59):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:01:01):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:01:05):**  our land, grow our food, and what we eat.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:01:08):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers, start paying much  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:01:12):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:01:16):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:01:41):**  Thank you!  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:01:43):**  Welcome to another episode.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:01:44):**  Today, with John Kempf, the co-founder of Advancing Ecoagriculture and obviously the  
**[0:01:48-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:01:48):**  host of the podcast Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:01:50):**  He and his team are helping growers to make more money with regenerative agriculture since  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:01:55):**  2006.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:01:56):**  And since 2006, they have served over 2 million acres all over the world.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:01):**  And he's focusing on how to make Regenegg the norm by 2040.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:06):**  And I've interviewed him almost exactly a year ago.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:08):**  So welcome back, John, on the show.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:10):**  Thanks for having me, Koen.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:11):**  I enjoyed our conversation last time, and I'm sure this one is going to be even more  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:14):**  fun.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:15):**  We have a lot to check in, actually.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:16):**  We're going to look back at the show we recorded last time, which I obviously will link below.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:20):**  And then we have some other pieces I would love your opinion on, your thoughts on.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:24):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:25):**  Very briefly for anybody that doesn't know you, we have a brief two-minute over who is  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:30):**  John Kempf and what is Advancing Ecoagriculture.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:33):**  Yeah, I believe that if you want to get people to change, you need to give them an economic  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:38):**  incentive to change.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:39):**  So the company of Advancing Ecoagriculture works with farmers to show them how they can  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:46):**  make more money, be more profitable, and be more successful using regenerative agriculture  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:52):**  practices and managing plant nutrition differently.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:02:55):**  We are agronomy consultants and coaches that work closely with them to reduce fertilizer  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:03:00):**  applications, to reduce pesticide applications.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:03:03):**  Our history really started in the high value of fruit and vegetable production space and  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:03:07):**  getting those growers to adopt regenerative agriculture practices.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:03:11):**  I see Advancing Ecoagriculture as an engine for change because we can change agriculture  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:03:17):**  and change the quality and quantity of food that is grown in the world purely as a result  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:03:22):**  of us being in business.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:03:24):**  And our intent and our desire is not to be all things to all people, but to set such  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:03:32):**  a high standard and provide such exceptional information and value and service that we  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:03:38):**  force other companies in the space to do business differently purely as a result of our practice.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:03:41):**  And that is already happening, which I'm very pleased and excited about.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:03:48):**  And this is all of course with an eye toward being very specific and very strategic about  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:03:52):**  how can we get agriculture to shift to the point where regenerative agriculture becomes  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:03:57):**  the mainstream in the next two decades.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:03:59):**  Yeah, which is definitely something we'll unpack.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:01):**  But first I wouldn't say housekeeping because these are very important pieces, but we discussed  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:05):**  them last time and actually there are big updates around that.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:09):**  So first of all, the book, you just published a book, I mean, I think this week even.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:13):**  So when this comes out, obviously it's going to have reviews, et cetera.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:16):**  But talk a bit about your book, Quality Agriculture.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:18):**  It's been an interesting pathway to producing this book and other books that are in the  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:22):**  pipeline now.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:23):**  So people have been asking me to write a book for over a decade.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:27):**  And finally I sat down to write an outline of everything that I wanted to include.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:33):**  And when I was done, the outline was 40 pages long and it looked like a really big project.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:38):**  So I scratched my head for a bit and then I said, wait a minute, we have all these podcast  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:43):**  interviews that we've done, all the webinars that I've taught, many presentations that  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:46):**  I've taught.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:47):**  Why don't we use those and get those transcribed and use those to fill in these various sections  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:53):**  of the book that I want to write?  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:04:56):**  So we started down this pathway and got all these episodes transcribed and I started editing  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:05:03):**  them and reviewing them.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:05:05):**  And I realized how incredibly valuable and important the information was in a lot of  
**[0:05:09-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:05:09):**  the conversations that I had had.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:05:11):**  And soon came to the conclusion that I would be doing a disservice both to my guests that  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:05:18):**  I had interviewed and to my readers if I tried to just extract bits and pieces from that.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:05:24):**  The book, Quality Agriculture is an edited, heavily edited for clarity, transcription  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:05:30):**  of 13 of the initial interviews that we had on the Regenerative Agriculture podcast, which  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:05:36):**  have been listened to hundreds of thousands of times already.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:05:40):**  And the book, we just launched it yesterday and just released it yesterday and already  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:05:45):**  the response has been extremely strong.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:05:47):**  People who are reading it electronically have had lots of good things to say about it, have  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:05:50):**  gotten lots of good feedback.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:05:52):**  So I expect it to become very popular and I see it as the first in a series.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:05:58):**  We'll continue doing this with the other interviews that I've done and release a set of volumes  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:06:02):**  over time.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:06:04):**  But I see myself, I mean, my name is on the cover, but I'm not so much, I've been responsible  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:06:10):**  for editing and review and everything else, but this is really the voices of some of the  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:06:14):**  leaders and the wise elders in the Regenerative Agriculture space who've been doing this work  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:06:19):**  in many cases for 20 or 30 years.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:06:23):**  And one of the things that I've come to really appreciate as the host of the podcast  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:06:28):**  and having conversations, I've noticed that there are two characteristics of all of the  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:06:34):**  episodes and all the people whose episodes become really popular.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:06:38):**  There are two characteristics that they all share in common.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:06:41):**  The one is that they are exceptionally observant.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:06:43):**  They really observe natural systems and what is happening and going on in the world around  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:06:47):**  them.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:06:49):**  And the second is that they come from a place within of a very strong heart connection and  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:06:56):**  deep empathy for others, deep empathy for people, for the landscape, for livestock.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:07:03):**  And I feel really blessed that I'm able to have conversation with people who have those  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:07:09):**  characteristics and who have decades of experience to share and that I can learn from and then  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:07:15):**  that others can learn from as well.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:07:16):**  So I'm certainly contributing in the sense that I'm guiding the conversation, asking  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:07:21):**  the questions, but these are voices from people who have some really incredible information  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:07:28):**  that in many cases is not widely known.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:07:31):**  And that's, I had several mentors when I was first starting out 15 years ago who had incredible  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:07:38):**  knowledge and passed away early and took much of that knowledge and information with them.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:07:44):**  And I would like to do my part in preventing that from happening with the many wise elders  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:07:50):**  that we have in our generation today.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:07:52):**  Yeah, we often forget how much work already has been done with way limited equipment and  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:07:59):**  tools and technology that we have now and things obviously to share, technology to share  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:04):**  that we're using to record this.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:06):**  But there's so much already done and so much to actually easily forgotten if the wrong  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:12):**  person passes away too early and didn't write it down or didn't record anything.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:17):**  A lot of that disappears, which obviously happened with previous generations.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:20):**  So documenting that and making it accessible because a podcast is great and audio form  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:24):**  is great, but it's very, we noticed that as well, it's very limited.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:28):**  I mean, there's only a very small percentage of people listening to things or watching  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:31):**  things even online compared to reading.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:34):**  So I think it's amazing to see that you actually translated that without just doing a transcript,  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:39):**  but actually heavily editing it for readability to make it accessible for a whole new audience  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:45):**  to read in this case electronically.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:47):**  But the books are being shipped so you can actually read it in paper form as well.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:50):**  Yeah, these are going to be incredible resources.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:53):**  And just echoing what you said earlier, there is so much knowledge and information that  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:08:58):**  has been lost from previous generations because we didn't do a good job of documenting it.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:02):**  And one of the things that I've realized is that there are two challenges that we often  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:07):**  see in this.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:08):**  I think this is just a general human characteristic, but I think it's particularly important in  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:12):**  the context of the regenerative agriculture conversation.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:16):**  There are many pioneers who have developed incredible wisdom and knowledge and experiences,  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:21):**  but in many cases they may be largely or almost completely unknown.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:26):**  People don't know about them.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:27):**  People don't hear about their stories.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:28):**  They're not widely shared.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:30):**  So my desire was to be able to draw some of that out and capture it.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:34):**  And then the other aspect you mentioned is information democracy.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:39):**  It's so important in today's world, I believe, to have information and knowledge be readily  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:45):**  accessible to everyone around the planet.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:48):**  And I would say within that, including not just the people who read English, which is  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:52):**  a limitation of course that we have in the language that we're speaking in and writing  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:09:57):**  in, is that that's only a fraction and a minority fraction of the world's population.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:03):**  But the fact that you have it written now means that translation becomes much easier  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:07):**  than audio translation.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:09):**  Exactly.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:10):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:12):**  So something I've heard you mention in a conversation with Ben Kittredge, I think it was recorded  
**[0:10:17-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:17):**  last year at the Bionutrient Food Association forum event where you mentioned that you are  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:24):**  working on, I called it in my notes, the AI-powered pharmacist, but obviously there must be a  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:30):**  much fancier or better name, but basically making all this knowledge or at least a big  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:35):**  chunk of this knowledge accessible for farmers anywhere.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:39):**  Can you elaborate a bit on that project?  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:43):**  What I have learned in these many conversations is that we're in a situation today where there  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:49):**  are areas of new knowledge that are useful, but in many cases we don't need any more information.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:54):**  We don't need any new information.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:10:56):**  We already have all the knowledge and all the information that we need, and we simply  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:00):**  need to propagate that and implement what it is that we already know.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:03):**  And I'm using the broadest sense of the collective we in this sense that we collectively already  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:09):**  have tremendous knowledge and information.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:11):**  We simply need that to be applied.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:13):**  And by applying you mean farmers, in this case, let's focus on the regenerative, it's  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:19):**  farmers implementing.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:21):**  Actually implementing it in the field.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:23):**  Yes.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:24):**  And the key to implementing regenerative farming systems successfully is that there is a broad  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:29):**  base of knowledge that is needed.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:31):**  Even mainstream farmers who are not using a regenerative approach, they need to have  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:34):**  a very diverse knowledge base that includes mechanics and nutrition and genetics and biology  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:40):**  and the list just kind of goes on and on.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:43):**  And that becomes even more pronounced and even more necessary in regenerative agriculture  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:47):**  systems where you need to manage all of these ecosystem interactions and understand all  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:53):**  the ecosystem interactions so that you can manage them well.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:11:56):**  And there is such an abundance of information available today about...  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:01):**  It's very daunting.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:02):**  I mean, that's huge going from plug and play.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:06):**  I wouldn't say plug and play, but plug and spray maybe.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:08):**  But for much less, how do you say, knowledge intense?  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:11):**  I mean, it's knowledge intense, but the moment you step into the realm of regenerative and  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:16):**  start making your first steps, et cetera, it becomes very complex, very quickly.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:21):**  And there are a million things you can look at and a million things you could or should  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:25):**  be doing.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:26):**  So it can be, I think, quite overwhelming, especially if you are just starting out.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:31):**  And regenerative agriculture, I think, could be appropriately described as target and spray.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:35):**  And so there is so much knowledge and information available today about how nutrients and how  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:42):**  biological organisms and cultural management practices contribute to different disease  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:48):**  organisms or insects and so forth.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:50):**  So we have all the information today that a farmer who has a crop should be able to  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:12:56):**  get an alert either on his phone or by whatever means or mechanism and say that you need to  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:13:03):**  begin scouting your crop for this insect because it's expected to emerge from dormancy in the  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:13:08):**  next three to four days.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:13:10):**  And of these eight different sections in your field or these eight different blocks, you  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:13:14):**  have these three out of your eight fields are highly susceptible.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:13:19):**  And the first field is highly susceptible because it doesn't have enough molybdenum  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:13:23):**  and therefore it has high levels of nitrate accumulation.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:13:26):**  The second field is highly susceptible because it doesn't have adequate magnesium.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:13:30):**  The third field is highly susceptible because it doesn't have adequate sulfur.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:13:34):**  The point is that we have all the knowledge today about how to manage plant nutritional  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:13:39):**  integrity so that plants can become resistant to all these different organisms.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:13:45):**  And yet monitoring that and understanding it and connecting all those dots is something  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:13:51):**  that I've spent the last 15 years doing and something that I really enjoy.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:13:56):**  But there's a tremendous knowledge base that is required behind that to connect all these  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:14:01):**  different pieces and deeply understand it.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:14:03):**  So the intent of in the interests of democratizing information and making this information accessible,  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:14:11):**  one of the projects that we have in the pipeline that we're working on is this software platform  
**[0:14:17-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:14:17):**  that we're calling the AI Agronomist.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:14:20):**  And the AI Agronomist is essentially what I've described, a tool that has the capacity  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:14:24):**  to monitor meteorological data, the plant's nutritional profile in the field, the soil  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:14:30):**  nutritional profile, and predict disease and insect susceptibility into the future.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:14:35):**  And also predict yield quality and the quality of that yield.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:14:40):**  So this has the capacity to be incredibly powerful because-  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:14:44):**  It sounds like magic almost.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:14:47):**  Well, we do this to a degree for human health and for veterinary medicine and so forth.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:14:53):**  We already have the information, we just haven't used it quite in this way because of the significant  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:14:58):**  vested interests that are in place on the treatment side of using pharmaceuticals or  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:15:03):**  chemicals to treat these problems.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:15:05):**  So I think this platform becomes incredibly powerful because it changes the conversation.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:15:10):**  Instead of the conversation being that I have this bug, I need to spray an insecticide,  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:15:15):**  the conversation now becomes I have this bug or I have susceptibility to this bug because  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:15:21):**  I don't have the right nutritional integrity.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:15:23):**  And if I want to change my susceptibility from an eight on a scale of one to 10 down  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:15:28):**  to a two, I need to apply molybdenum.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:15:32):**  And all of a sudden it connects the dots that there is a nutritional correlation to disease  
**[0:15:38-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:15:38):**  and insect susceptibility.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:15:40):**  And it's incredibly empowering for the growers because now it gives them the resources, the  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:15:47):**  connection, they can do something and they can also do the research and immediately try  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:15:50):**  to connect the dots around what is the why behind this, what's happening and what's going  
**[0:15:54-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:15:54):**  on.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:15:55):**  So I think it'll be incredibly valuable and powerful for growers all around the world  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:00):**  to be able to see this.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:02):**  And the intent is not to get farmers out of the field and have them looking at the screen  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:10):**  for alerts, but actually to use this to get growers into the field more and asking better  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:16):**  questions.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:17):**  Going back to the comment that I made earlier, there are many pioneering growers who are  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:23):**  very gifted observationally.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:26):**  They are very good at making keen observations around what's happening in natural ecosystems.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:30):**  And our desire to the degree that we can is to use this as a tool to facilitate asking  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:36):**  better questions and observing better what's happening and going on in the landscape.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:40):**  So basically using the technology to train almost or to incentivize and to nudge more  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:47):**  farmers to train their observation.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:50):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:51):**  We ask them questions.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:53):**  We ask them to both take photos and also to evaluate how their crop is doing.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:16:58):**  How widely are the leaf nodes spaced apart?  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:00):**  How many flowers do you have per cluster?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:03):**  How large is your root biomass?  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:04):**  What's your water infiltration rate?  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:06):**  So we ask farmers to do all these measurements and upload them to the platform.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:12):**  To get closer to their plants and soil basically.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:15):**  Exactly.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:16):**  And what's the timeline?  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:17):**  Where do you start with this?  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:19):**  Because it seems gigantic.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:21):**  Would there be one crop, one type of grower, one region?  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:26):**  How do you approach something so big?  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:30):**  The pathway that we're following is we begin by identifying the crops that we can have  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:34):**  the most significant economic impact on globally in the short term.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:37):**  We begin working with those and these are the crops that most people depend on as a  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:41):**  food source crops such as rice and wheat and corn and soybeans.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:45):**  But then also not just exclusively those grain crops but also working on fruit and vegetable  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:50):**  crops, apples, cherries.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:52):**  And we're also focusing on working on the crops that have the most significant pesticide  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:57):**  use.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:17:58):**  If apples and cherries and strawberries are among the most significant pesticide users,  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:01):**  crops demonstrate the proof of concept in the environment in which it's the most difficult.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:07):**  And then deploying it on other crops in the regions around the country becomes a lot easier.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:12):**  So it is a very ambitious project.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:13):**  It's a very big project.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:14):**  And at the same time, the foundational principles behind these nutritional correlations and  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:22):**  nutritional interactions in various disease organisms and insects and the meteorological  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:27):**  data, the foundational principles behind these interactions are relatively similar from crop  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:32):**  to crop.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:33):**  And they're even similar between different groups of insects.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:36):**  So there might be hundreds of possible insect pests.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:40):**  But when you begin categorizing them based on their nutritional requirements and the  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:44):**  amino acid profile that they require within a plant, you can actually group them into  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:49):**  perhaps as little as five or six groups.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:52):**  So when you group them together, then you can put in the data of how many heat units  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:18:57):**  are growing degree days are required for them to emerge from dormancy or whatever.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:01):**  You can look at all those parameters.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:03):**  And it is a very big project.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:06):**  I'm not discounting that at all.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:08):**  But it is not as difficult as it might perhaps at first appear.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:12):**  And in terms of timeline, when are you hoping expecting?  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:14):**  I mean, timelines are always difficult.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:16):**  What's your hope?  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:17):**  I haven't put a mark in the ground at this point.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:21):**  We do have a version of this that we are already using in-house in our consulting work as an  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:26):**  alpha test that we're using with our Advancing Ecoagriculture team.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:31):**  And we need to continue developing that and expanding that.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:35):**  In order for this to have the performance that I just described and be this level of  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:43):**  an assistant to a grower, there is one thing that we really need.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:47):**  And that is we need the capacity to measure a plant's nutritional profile in the field  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:52):**  in real time.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:53):**  That is technology that Dan Kittredge is working on and that other people are working on.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:19:57):**  So can you explain for layman, what does that mean?  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:00):**  What do you need to measure when you the nutritional profile of a plant in the field?  
**[0:20:05-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:05):**  I need to have a device, a sensor that a crop scout or a farmer can carry into the field  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:13):**  and can measure the concentrations of nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus and 20 some different  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:18):**  minerals and perhaps also the amino acid profile of the plant and immediately upload it to  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:23):**  the cloud.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:24):**  That technology as of this moment in time is only housed within a laboratory context.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:31):**  It's not mobile that you can take it into the field.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:33):**  You do that by scanning like a leaf or an apple or what would the process look like?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:38):**  The process would be as simple as taking a snapshot of a leaf or an apple, whatever part  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:44):**  of the plant that you want to measure.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:46):**  And that's the missing piece.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:48):**  That is the missing piece.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:49):**  We know that technology is coming.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:51):**  It's not a question of if, it's only a question of when.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:54):**  So we are continuing to develop this in-house and we have not put a line in the sand to  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:20:59):**  say that we need to have this ready to go by a certain date because we are waiting for  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:02):**  that technology to be developed.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:04):**  In the meantime, we're developing the platform and actively using it using laboratory data.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:10):**  So we are collecting the sample, sending it to the laboratory and getting the traditional  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:13):**  data and that's how we're building out the proof of concept and so forth.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:17):**  It's an interesting point to make.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:19):**  We made it in the previous interview, but why are you focusing so much on plants is  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:23):**  the underlying reason there is that you stated and you state probably again, if I would ask  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:28):**  you that healthy plants are not attacked by pests or at least attacked in a way different  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:34):**  way, which is something that probably many listeners would, I don't know, not know or  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:39):**  be very skeptical about.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:41):**  Is that something you encounter often?  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:43):**  Like people say, yeah, but pests are always going to be there.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:45):**  But the underlying reason here is if your plants are strong, healthy, nutritious, et  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:50):**  cetera, you don't have necessarily a pest issue.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:54):**  Pests are not always going to be there.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:21:55):**  And every farmer who is honest in his observations knows this to be true.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:22:01):**  If you have a field with a given crop, the insect pest or a disease never begins attacking  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:22:07):**  the entire field uniformly.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:22:08):**  They always concentrate first in one area, perhaps in an area that there was where it  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:22:13):**  was too wet and there was water standing for a couple of weeks.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:22:16):**  There can be any number of factors, but insects and diseases do not occur at random.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:22:22):**  They are simply nature's survival of the fittest mechanisms that are here to take unhealthy  
**[0:22:26-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:22:26):**  plants out of the system before we can consume them.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:22:29):**  And then we, of course, in our so-called wisdom, spray toxins on these plants and feed them  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:22:35):**  to people, which is a really stupid thing to do.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:22:38):**  But it is absolutely possible for plants to be completely 100% resistant to all diseases  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:22:45):**  and all insects.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:22:46):**  And I know that that is a very significant claim.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:22:50):**  It's not one that I make lightly, but I can make that claim based on actual field experience  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:22:56):**  of accomplishing those results on millions of acres, on dozens of different crops and  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:01):**  on multiple continents.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:03):**  I haven't personally experienced this, but colleagues that I work closely with have experienced  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:07):**  growing crops that were completely resistant to locusts, to a swarm of locusts in Africa.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:13):**  And I can promise you, if you can grow a crop that is resistant to a swarm of locusts, you  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:17):**  can grow plants that are pretty much resistant to everything.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:20):**  That's very, I mean, it places a bomb underneath the input industry, basically, which is obviously  
**[0:23:26-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:26):**  why there's so much pushback, which we discussed before.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:29):**  That's the, it's very hopeful.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:31):**  When you look at it from a high level perspective, there are not many significant differences  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:36):**  between the medical pharmaceutical industry and the agricultural pharmaceutical industry.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:42):**  They're often the same.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:44):**  They're often the same, often the same players, and they both have the desire to maintain  
**[0:23:48-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:48):**  the continuity of a problem so they can sell their pharmaceutical band-aids to cover the  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:55):**  problem.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:23:56):**  But in the case of either human health or plant health or animal health, if you identify  
**[0:24:02-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:24:02):**  the dietary or nutritional foundations of the health imbalances, you can, not always,  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:24:10):**  certainly, but in the significant majority of cases, you can prevent the problems from  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:24:14):**  showing up in the first place.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:24:16):**  To make a nice bridge, is that something, because last time we discussed, actually,  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:24:19):**  you were very enthusiastic about a product you're working on to launch, which is an input  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:24:24):**  product, like when you sell inputs, but very different ones.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:24:27):**  Did that launch?  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:24:28):**  And if so, how did that go?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:24:31):**  Many soils today have become substantially degraded, not so much from a nutritional perspective.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:24:37):**  They can be nutritionally degraded from a nutritional perspective, but even more significantly,  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:24:42):**  perhaps much more significantly, their microbiome has deteriorated because of historical pesticide  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:24:47):**  applications.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:24:49):**  We know that there are some organisms that have been developed for hydrocarbon remediation,  
**[0:24:54-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:24:54):**  oil spill remediation, and so forth, that seem to be very effective at remediating these  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:02):**  pesticides in the soil and allowing the microbial population to really expand and to develop  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:08):**  a very strong microbiome around root systems again.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:12):**  We've been developing this product.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:15):**  I've been working on it for probably five or six years.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:17):**  We launched it, we did a partial launch a year ago and released it in one state, and  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:23):**  it's now available in several states here in the US.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:26):**  It's a product called Santerra.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:29):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:30):**  I'm going to jump through some interesting regulatory loopholes to get it registered  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:35):**  for sale in additional states because some of the organisms that we are using to produce  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:39):**  these effects are not widely known or considered to be useful active microbes in an agricultural  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:45):**  setting.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:46):**  And yet, every time we apply them, we get these tremendous crop responses.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:50):**  It's not so much that these organisms are contributing directly to the crop as that  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:54):**  they are changing the environment and allowing the organisms that should be present to proliferate  
**[0:25:59-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:25:59):**  and develop.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:00):**  And so the results have been good.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:02):**  The results have been absolutely incredible.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:04):**  Because we were discussing it last time, I now remember actually part of the discussion  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:08):**  that especially the speed was quite impressive of applying this specific input and the speed  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:14):**  of what the soil actually was responding to.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:17):**  I'm always amazed at the incredible resilience of natural ecosystems and their capacity to  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:23):**  recover from all the damage that we have inflicted.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:26):**  There was one case in particular, I mean, there have been many cases, but one in particular  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:30):**  that comes to mind was when this product was applied on a peach orchard that was severely  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:35):**  stunted.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:36):**  These were older peach trees that were about 20, I think just over 20 years old, which  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:41):**  should be considered a young peach orchard, but unfortunately is considered an old peach  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:44):**  orchard in today's agricultural context.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:47):**  Because how old can peaches get?  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:49):**  If they're managed well and have good nutrition, they can easily become 80 to 100 years old  
**[0:26:52-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:52):**  and produce exceptional crops.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:26:55):**  These trees had for the prior five years only produced an inch to an inch and a half of  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:01):**  new growth per year, so very small amount of new growth.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:06):**  There was no energy, there was no vigor, and you could see that these trees were slowly  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:09):**  dying.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:11):**  The grower fully intended to take a bulldozer to the block and push them out and start over  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:17):**  if we weren't able to turn them around in a single year.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:19):**  He gave us a one-year opportunity to turn them around.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:22):**  We applied this microbial inoculant with some biosimilans and some other goodies to the  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:28):**  soil profile.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:30):**  In three months, there was 18 inches of new growth after five years of no growth to speak  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:37):**  of.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:38):**  That was absolutely incredible.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:41):**  Trees recovering and turning around that fast.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:44):**  The important aspect to consider here is that we added no fertilizers.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:49):**  We added no nutrients.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:50):**  I actually, maybe I can't make the blank statement that we added no.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:54):**  We might have added very small amounts of chelated manganese and trace minerals to the  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:27:58):**  soil profile, but in terms of adding large quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus and  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:28:03):**  potassium and so forth, we added none of those macronutrients, and yet we observed this incredible  
**[0:28:08-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:28:08):**  rebirth and regeneration of these trees.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:28:11):**  Those are the types of stories that I get really excited about because now the reality  
**[0:28:14-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:28:14):**  is that in the development of this product, it's proven challenging for us to find laboratories  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:28:21):**  who are actually willing to do third-party testing and validate that pesticides are being  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:28:26):**  remediated from the soil profile.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:28:28):**  They're concerned about what the repercussions of that might be, but from an observational  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:28:37):**  and experiential perspective of how these plants are improving, it is obvious that whatever  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:28:43):**  we are adding is having a significant effect on plant health and performance and on the  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:28:48):**  soil ecosystem's health and performance.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:28:51):**  That is easy to observe and easy to measure.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:28:54):**  We're not going out and making claims to say that, oh, we can remediate glyphosate and  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:00):**  we can remediate these pesticides because we're having a hard time actually documenting  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:03):**  and measuring that, but we can observe the tremendous crop responses, and when growers  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:09):**  experience that and see that, it doesn't take very long for them to make the decision that  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:13):**  they want to apply it on a lot of acres.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:15):**  No, I can imagine.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:17):**  And actually, for anybody that's not a farmer, actually like myself, you've also launched  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:23):**  a daily newsletter, I think it was back in October, no, maybe...  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:28):**  December.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:29):**  Which has been teaching me a lot.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:30):**  I usually read them in a block, so I read 10 or 20 in a row, and I have to be honest,  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:36):**  a lot of the topics are way over my head in terms of depth in plant health and soil health,  
**[0:29:42-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:42):**  et cetera, but they're very, very interesting.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:44):**  A lot of interesting papers, et cetera.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:46):**  So for anybody that's interested in that, definitely sign up on your website on this  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:51):**  newsletter just to learn about the depth and breadth of what is happening at the moment  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:29:56):**  and how much is changing, how much knowledge is already there and how much we already know  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:30:00):**  and how much we're discovering, I wouldn't say daily, but almost daily.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:30:04):**  Thanks for sharing that, Koen.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:30:06):**  And I'm intrigued to hear you say that they're above your head because I specifically tried  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:30:11):**  to make them very simple and easy to understand and very short and brief and to the point,  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:30:17):**  but the intention of the blog was to, again, as I described earlier, I've discovered that  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:30:23):**  there is so much knowledge and so much agronomic information that is not widely known, and  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:30:29):**  many growers and agronomists don't have the bandwidth or the desire to spend time reading  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:30:36):**  white papers and reading articles to discover the new information, the new research that  
**[0:30:41-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:30:41):**  is out there, as well as the old information and the knowledge that has been lost.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:30:44):**  So the intent of the blog was to put this information out there in easily digestible  
**[0:30:51-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:30:51):**  pieces and also as accountability for myself to commit to writing and publishing a certain  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:30:58):**  number of blog posts every week, and that would eventually lead to putting a book together  
**[0:31:04-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:04):**  or expanding the series of books.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:06):**  So it's been a fun project.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:08):**  I would invite all of our listeners to please subscribe at johnkempf.com and share your  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:15):**  thoughts and feedback and question if there's any topics that you would like for me to address.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:19):**  It's definitely accessible, but I think for me, sometimes the terms, like the specific  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:23):**  deep plant health terms that I'd have to Google or find in a dictionary.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:28):**  So the language is definitely accessible, but the other few terms here and there that  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:32):**  are above what I know and what I daily deal with, obviously, as a non-farmer, but it's  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:38):**  highly, I would say, relevant and informational and also entertaining because they're short,  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:44):**  they're easy to learn.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:45):**  If you want to go deep, you can go deep.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:47):**  And if you don't, you don't, you click to the next one.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:50):**  And with that, I would like to ask a question we didn't get to last time because I don't  
**[0:31:54-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:54):**  think I was asking it yet.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:31:56):**  What if tomorrow morning or actually today, let's say after we close this interview, you'll  
**[0:32:00-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:00):**  be in charge of a $1 billion investment portfolio and you are focused on making region ag the  
**[0:32:07-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:07):**  norm by 2040.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:08):**  Actually, you can invest it in anything you want.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:11):**  I'm not going to give you the limitation, but what would you be as John Kemp investment  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:16):**  manager of this investment portfolio of $1 billion?  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:19):**  What would you invest it in or how would you invest it?  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:23):**  Wow.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:24):**  That's a big question.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:27):**  You know, I'm just a bit of context.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:30):**  I'm asking it because I see the interest growing from investors and I made a, I think I would  
**[0:32:37-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:37):**  say a bet because I maybe lose the money, but I'm thinking that quite a few large institutional  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:44):**  investors and larger family funds and family offices are entering this space.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:48):**  And a number of the people in this space are going to get these phone calls.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:51):**  I would love to invest in soil, regenerate agriculture, plants, et cetera.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:55):**  Can I place a billion dollars or euros or yens or, but a large amount.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:32:59):**  I don't think we're that far off that moment that that's going to happen more often.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:03):**  And I think we as a sector need to be ready to have the infrastructure ready to absorb  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:07):**  those kinds of amounts and put them actually to work in a proper regenerative way.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:12):**  So just to give a bit of context to that question.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:14):**  I commend you for asking good questions.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:17):**  I believe that many times breakthroughs are made by asking different questions and by  
**[0:33:23-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:23):**  asking good questions.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:24):**  And I think this is a very good question.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:26):**  So I've thought about this question, thought about it a lot historically, and then it get  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:31):**  more, a bit more and more recently.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:33):**  And so here are my thoughts on how I would deploy a billion dollars and a billion dollar  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:40):**  fund.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:41):**  So I believe as for some context and some background to my thoughts, I believe that  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:46):**  in general business is a very powerful way to drive change.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:52):**  I see, as I described, advancing ecoagriculture, I see AEA as an engine for change and I see  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:33:58):**  business as a self-sustaining engine for change.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:34:01):**  So there is the opportunity to make money, but then also in addition to making the money  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:34:08):**  to have a very significant impact.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:34:11):**  So my personal strategy and what I really care about, what I believe the planet really  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:34:17):**  needs to make a significant difference on the planet in our longterm future is to have  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:34:21):**  regenerative agriculture become the mainstream in the next couple of decades.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:34:24):**  So that is definitely what I would focus on.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:34:27):**  So how would I deploy that?  
**[0:34:29-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:34:29):**  There's one other aspect as well, which I believe that a fund should also seek to not  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:34:37):**  just benefit itself, but to demonstrate for others the incredible opportunity that they  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:34:43):**  have to also produce change and be very profitable.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:34:47):**  And so also to demonstrate incentives for others.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:34:50):**  So when we think about a billion dollars in the context of global agriculture, the reality  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:34:57):**  is that a billion dollars is a very small amount in that context.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:35:02):**  We have equity that is in the trillions of dollars.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:35:06):**  And so to produce the level of the systemic level of change that we're seeking to produce,  
**[0:35:13-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:35:13):**  a billion dollars would need to be deployed very strategically and in areas that you can  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:35:19):**  really leverage significantly to produce significant change.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:35:23):**  And I think this is one area that at least in the practices that I've observed in the  
**[0:35:31-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:35:31):**  currently very small regenerative agriculture space have shifts to regenerative agriculture  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:35:38):**  and various funds have largely been focused on farmland and investing in farmland.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:35:43):**  And while I see the opportunity and the-  
**[0:35:46-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:35:46):**  Basically buying and-  
**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:35:48):**  Yes.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:35:49):**  I see the opportunity and I see the security that is present in investing in farmland that  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:35:54):**  is an appreciable asset and so forth, but I don't believe that is the place where we  
**[0:35:59-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:35:59):**  can produce the most change.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:36:00):**  Now I do believe that that is one place where there is an opportunity there to demonstrate  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:36:07):**  for other stakeholders the significant potential that exists.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:36:11):**  So if I were to think about deploying a billion dollars, focusing on strategically, I would  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:36:16):**  try to identify what are the barriers to adoption for regenerative agriculture and specifically  
**[0:36:22-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:36:22):**  invest in removing those barriers.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:36:24):**  So that implies that we're not just investing in agriculture itself, but in the entire ecosystem  
**[0:36:31-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:36:31):**  of supporting businesses and services around agriculture and around farmland.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:36:37):**  So when we break that down, when I break that down and look at specific opportunities, there  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:36:43):**  are first speak a little bit about the opportunities that come to mind in farmland itself and demonstrating  
**[0:36:49-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:36:49):**  for others the opportunity that exists.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:36:51):**  I see that there are two areas that there are significant economic opportunities.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:36:56):**  One of them is grass fed beef in areas where grazing is not well deployed.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:37:01):**  That's kind of a whole conversation that I'm not necessarily the expert in, but I've observed  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:37:07):**  many conversions where I had this interesting conversation with Joel Salatin just a few  
**[0:37:13-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:37:13):**  episodes ago on our podcast where he described that soil, land that has the capacity to produce  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:37:23):**  100 bushels per acre of corn can produce 400 cow days of grazing for grazing beef.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:37:29):**  So you can use that conversion factor of 100 bushels to 400 cow days of grazing for whatever  
**[0:37:34-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:37:34):**  the corn yields might be.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:37:37):**  And in every market, when Joel has had a conversation with farmers, he's asked them to put the numbers  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:37:43):**  on the board of what their costs are of purchasing stock or cattle and the market prices of selling  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:37:49):**  beef, the input costs for producing corn, the corn profitably in every single market  
**[0:37:56-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:37:56):**  in dozens of presentations, producing grass fed beef always is more profitable and makes  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:03):**  more money than growing corn.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:05):**  But many farmers don't make the transition.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:08):**  Why is everyone growing corn?  
**[0:38:10-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:10):**  It's because they are in many cases, they're locked into a system.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:13):**  They have bank loans, they have large pieces of equipment, combines and so forth.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:20):**  Many growers are, they're comfortable.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:22):**  People are resistant to change.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:24):**  It's a very human characteristic.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:25):**  I'm not faulting them for where they are, but-  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:28):**  They're friends and neighbors.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:30):**  Yes, they feel stuck and trapped into a system for any number of different reasons.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:36):**  And yet to me, it's so profound that we have grass fed beef being more profitable than  
**[0:38:41-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:41):**  grain production on tens of millions of acres, hundreds of millions of acres.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:47):**  And yet the current status quo system that is degrading the environment and the ecosystems  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:52):**  and the planet as a whole continues to remain to be the status quo.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:38:57):**  So I see that as being one immediate significant opportunity.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:03):**  How would you invest in the environment?  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:05):**  What would you look for?  
**[0:39:07-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:07):**  Well, you can invest in the underlying land.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:11):**  That's one pathway.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:12):**  But if I were to seek to deploy a billion dollars as efficiently as possible in this  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:17):**  particular context, you could also, and what I think would be a better opportunity is you  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:23):**  could simply lease the land.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:24):**  You can rent the land and graze it.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:27):**  Imagine doing that on tens of thousands of acres or hundreds of thousands of acres in  
**[0:39:30-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:30):**  the American Midwest.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:32):**  You can compete with the farmers who are renting land for corn ground.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:36):**  You can out-compete them because you are more profitable and you can regenerate large quantities  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:43):**  of land, large areas of land very quickly and make money and be very profitable while  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:48):**  doing so without having a tremendous amount of equity tied up.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:53):**  So perhaps there are positives in having that equity side as well.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:39:57):**  So I understand that there are different objectives that can be achieved here.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:40:00):**  But the point is that there are many more opportunities than just investing in the farmland  
**[0:40:06-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:40:06):**  itself.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:40:07):**  Then there is a second opportunity in actual production agriculture that I believe is even  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:40:12):**  bigger, perhaps significantly bigger than grazing beef.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:40:17):**  And that is in one specific category of crops that I refer to as the untapped genetic potential  
**[0:40:25-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:40:25):**  crops of usually what we refer to as multi-fruiting reproductive crops.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:40:31):**  So let me just clarify that lexicon a little bit and describe what I'm talking about.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:40:35):**  So we have some crops that are vegetative that we harvest the vegetative parts of the  
**[0:40:41-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:40:41):**  plant like alfalfa and kale and spinach.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:40:44):**  And then you have reproductive crops, the crops where you actually harvest the fruit  
**[0:40:48-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:40:48):**  or grain.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:40:49):**  These would be rice, corn, tomatoes, soybeans, etc.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:40:52):**  And then within this category of reproductive crops, you have some crops that are highly  
**[0:40:59-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:40:59):**  developed.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:41:00):**  They've been studied intensely and their management and their nutrition has been studied intensely.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:41:05):**  And they're at a reasonably high level of performance.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:41:07):**  Corn would be an example of a crop in this category or tomatoes or strawberries.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:41:12):**  Then you have other crops that have not been highly developed.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:41:17):**  They've been largely ignored in terms of their agronomic development.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:41:21):**  And an appropriate historical example of this would be strawberries in North America, which  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:41:26):**  is the marketplace that I'm most familiar with.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:41:29):**  Twenty years ago, the average yield for strawberries in California was 4,000 flats per acre.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:41:35):**  That's eight quarts or eight pound flats.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:41:38):**  Today, the average yield is 10,000 flats per acre.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:41:42):**  So you've had a 250% yield increase over the last 20 years purely as a result of managing  
**[0:41:50-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:41:50):**  this crop much more intensely.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:41:52):**  There have been some improvements in genetics, absolutely, but not to that degree.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:41:56):**  It's that nutrition and irrigation and everything else is being managed much more intensely.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:02):**  And what we have observed in our work with Advancing Ecoagriculture, I believe very much  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:09):**  that you produce the change that you desire to see in the world when you give people an  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:13):**  incentive for that change.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:16):**  So when we talk to growers and in our marketing at Advancing Ecoagriculture, we don't speak  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:21):**  extensively about producing crops that are resistant to diseases and insects and eliminating  
**[0:42:25-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:25):**  the need for pesticides.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:26):**  We don't speak about growing food as medicine, and we don't speak about regenerating soil  
**[0:42:31-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:31):**  health and sequestering carbon and building soil organic matter.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:34):**  Those are all secondary outcomes.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:37):**  They are a result of the work that we do with the growers.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:40):**  They happen automatically.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:41):**  The conversation we have with the grower is we can help you make more money, be more profitable  
**[0:42:46-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:46):**  and more successful by managing nutrition differently.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:49):**  That's it.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:50):**  That's the conversation that we have.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:51):**  And what we have observed is that there are many of these high value fruit and vegetable  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:42:56):**  crops which have a very large untapped yield potential.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:43:02):**  They have not been highly developed like strawberries have, for example.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:43:06):**  And so for these crops, when we work with growers who are growing these crops, we don't  
**[0:43:10-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:43:10):**  even use some of their yield increases in our testimonials and when we tell the stories  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:43:17):**  of the successes that we've had because people wouldn't believe us.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:43:22):**  We've had growers report 70% yield increases in marketable yield on onions, 120% yield  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:43:29):**  increases on citrus, lemon specifically.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:43:34):**  It's very common for us, for groups in this category, or excuse me, for crops in this  
**[0:43:38-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:43:38):**  category to have anywhere from 30% to 50% yield increases.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:43:44):**  This is not uncommon at all.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:43:46):**  So when you think about that, now you can be incredibly competitive with all the other  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:43:52):**  growers for these crops in the landscape.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:43:54):**  So there is another significant investment opportunity there.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:43:58):**  And how would you deploy capital in that opportunity?  
**[0:44:03-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:03):**  Would it be buying, operating farmers?  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:05):**  Would it be investing in the potential service?  
**[0:44:10-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:10):**  What would be your angle?  
**[0:44:11-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:11):**  I think the angle there, as I see it from my perspective, is you need to have control  
**[0:44:17-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:17):**  over the actual production.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:20):**  So whether that means owning the land or whether that means renting land, leasing land with  
**[0:44:25-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:25):**  this crop on it and then developing it, both of those are possibilities and happen routinely.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:31):**  So essentially, you need to control the production and most likely operate and manage that production  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:37):**  or hire that management to be done in a certain way.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:41):**  So those are two areas.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:43):**  I realize I'm perhaps going into this into too much detail because I think there are  
**[0:44:48-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:48):**  other areas.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:49):**  So these are both areas within production itself.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:51):**  So when you look at the ecosystem around this, when you seek to identify strategically what  
**[0:44:58-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:44:58):**  are the barriers to adoption of regenerative agriculture on scale and how can we invest  
**[0:45:03-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:45:03):**  in removing those barriers to adoption, there are a number of different barriers that come  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:45:08):**  up in conversation routinely with growers and with people that I ask these questions  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:45:13):**  because I also constantly ask the question of how can we produce a change in the landscape  
**[0:45:19-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:45:19):**  and a change in the ecosystem.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:45:21):**  And one of those barriers to entry, I'm of course, I'm most familiar with the Western  
**[0:45:27-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:45:27):**  world, specifically North America.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:45:29):**  That's the context of the domain that I'm most familiar with.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:45:31):**  But I know that there are also going to be similar and in some cases, different barriers  
**[0:45:35-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:45:35):**  to entry in developing parts of the world.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:45:38):**  One significant barrier to entry in North America right now is market access or having  
**[0:45:45-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:45:45):**  the right infrastructure for market access.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:45:47):**  So it's very difficult for growers to grow crops that are non-GMO, for example, or even  
**[0:45:54-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:45:54):**  organically certified, or we're now getting requests to be connected with growers who  
**[0:46:00-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:00):**  are producing grains in a regenerative manner.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:02):**  But finding storage facilities to separate out and store these grains separately and  
**[0:46:07-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:07):**  then get them to the market separately is a significant problem.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:10):**  They tend to all be put together into the same pool.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:14):**  That's one example of infrastructure that is needed for better market access.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:20):**  Meat processing is another.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:21):**  Developing parts of the world would be refrigeration.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:23):**  So these are all different aspects that I think can lead to significant adoption of  
**[0:46:30-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:30):**  regenerative agriculture if we remove some of these roadblocks.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:33):**  Another pathway that I believe we could have produced significant change is facilitating  
**[0:46:40-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:40):**  farmland succession.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:42):**  We know that in the United States, we're going to have the biggest turnover of farmland in  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:48):**  recorded history in the next 10 to 15 years where as much as 50 to 60 percent of all the  
**[0:46:53-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:53):**  farmland is going to change hands.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:46:55):**  Because of retirement, I think the average age of a farmer is very close to 60 and maybe  
**[0:47:00-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:47:00):**  even in some countries above 60, which means that they're going to change hands if we like  
**[0:47:06-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:47:06):**  it or not or be abandoned, which is happening actually surprisingly often as well.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:47:11):**  Yeah, that is unfortunate.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:47:13):**  So when we think about facilitating succession of farmland, there is an opportunity to invest  
**[0:47:20-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:47:20):**  in land again, but in reality, that is again, that's a very expensive way of deploying a  
**[0:47:27-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:47:27):**  billion dollars and you wouldn't have nearly significant impact in producing change.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:47:31):**  What we really need is we're going to need to develop and train thousands, millions really  
**[0:47:38-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:47:38):**  of young farmers.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:47:40):**  And so we have an opportunity by providing the education and the development of changing  
**[0:47:48-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:47:48):**  the narrative away from mainstream chemistry, pharmaceutical based agriculture to a regenerative  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:47:53):**  agriculture when we support and train and coach the young emerging generation of farmers  
**[0:47:58-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:47:58):**  that is going to be needed for this succession.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:01):**  So there is both academic learning, there's peer to peer learning.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:04):**  And then the other opportunity is to facilitate the transfer of equity.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:09):**  So you could invest in farmland directly.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:12):**  Yeah, which you can I mean, you can use the billion or part of that billion because obviously  
**[0:48:16-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:16):**  you're looking at it from a portfolio approach.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:18):**  So you're splitting it up in terms of diversification.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:21):**  But there you can use part of that billion to give access to younger farmers without  
**[0:48:27-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:27):**  buying the underlying land forever and somehow leverage that and do a lot more hectares or  
**[0:48:33-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:33):**  acres than you could have done if you just bought the land and rented it out, leased  
**[0:48:36-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:36):**  it out to some young farmers.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:39):**  Exactly right.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:40):**  That's exactly what I had in mind.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:41):**  There are ways to leverage money to use it and deploy it on a lot more acres rather than  
**[0:48:45-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:45):**  fewer acres than just by purchasing it outright.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:47):**  Yeah, there's some very interesting work there by the Agrarian Trust.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:51):**  We interviewed Ian a long time ago.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:53):**  I will make sure to link it below to take a lot of the land off the market.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:48:57):**  Obviously, that's another discussion in terms of land ownership.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:00):**  And in terms of the infrastructure discussed before, Pipeline Foods is doing some of that  
**[0:49:05-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:05):**  work.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:06):**  Eric Jackson, who we had on the show twice.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:08):**  But there's an enormous need for separation basically of these streams because otherwise  
**[0:49:13-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:13):**  you become decommoditizing these enormous infrastructure streams that we have set up  
**[0:49:17-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:17):**  around certain crops.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:19):**  And the access fees, I think, to young farmers is something we don't think about often because  
**[0:49:23-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:23):**  many of these young farmers don't come from a farming background, which means they're  
**[0:49:26-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:26):**  not going to inherit the farm.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:28):**  And so they're cut out because with the current farmland prices, they would never be able  
**[0:49:33-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:33):**  to buy anything big.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:35):**  And so they're often either stuck on a very small one or they give up altogether, which  
**[0:49:38-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:38):**  is an enormous loss because we need this young energy.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:42):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:43):**  Going back again to when we look at the overall ecosystem and what are barriers to adoption,  
**[0:49:48-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:48):**  barriers to entry, I think there are other, this is from my perspective as being very  
**[0:49:52-0:49:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:52):**  closely engaged in the agronomy, I see several areas where there is tremendous unrecognized  
**[0:49:59-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:49:59):**  opportunity.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:50:00):**  One of them is in developing appropriate plant genetics.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:50:04):**  Our genetics have, speaking in very broad terms, but the majority of modern genetics  
**[0:50:10-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:50:10):**  have been adapted to thrive in a pharmaceutical model of agriculture.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:50:18):**  And these varieties in many cases don't perform well when they're put into biological  
**[0:50:25-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:50:25):**  agricultural systems.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:50:26):**  However, the inverse of that perspective is very true and very real.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:50:31):**  I've experienced this in several cases where crops were produced or genetic were bred specifically  
**[0:50:37-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:50:37):**  for biological agricultural systems and these varieties that were bred for biological agricultural  
**[0:50:43-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:50:43):**  systems, they tend to have much larger, more robust root systems, much better plant structure.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:50:47):**  They're more disease resistant, they're more resilient in general.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:50:51):**  And when we put those into the present mainstream systems, they're significant outperformers.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:50:56):**  And this is actually plant genetics and breeding.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:50:59):**  It is a long-term investment.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:51:01):**  It's not something that you turn around in the short term, but it has the capacity to  
**[0:51:05-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:51:05):**  be immensely profitable.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:51:07):**  When you look at the large corporations that are involved in seeds and pharmaceuticals  
**[0:51:12-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:51:12):**  today in agriculture, there's a reason that they are the most significant players is because  
**[0:51:16-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:51:16):**  these are very profitable pathways.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:51:17):**  And it is possible to monetize the production of genetics in ways other than just genetic  
**[0:51:26-0:51:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:51:26):**  modification and patenting and that pathway of intellectual property production.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:51:30):**  So when I look at the fruit and vegetable production space, it is the nurseries and  
**[0:51:36-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:51:36):**  the breeders that by and large have, they have some of the highest returns in the agricultural  
**[0:51:43-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:51:43):**  space in general.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:51:44):**  So there is an opportunity here to produce exceptional genetics for this ecosystem and  
**[0:51:50-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:51:50):**  to also have very strong returns.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:51:53):**  Then another opportunity is if you want to produce wholesale change, you asked me the  
**[0:51:58-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:51:58):**  question in our previous conversation, if I could wave a magic wand and produce one  
**[0:52:04-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:52:04):**  change, what would I do or something along those lines?  
**[0:52:07-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:52:07):**  And I answered that I would remove the capacity for people to use nitrogen fertilizer.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:52:14):**  And I still believe that if we were to heavily tax nitrogen fertilizer, that one change could  
**[0:52:21-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:52:21):**  that one lever of influence could facilitate tremendous change because nitrogen is to crop  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:52:29):**  production the equivalent of what Red Bull is for athletes.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:52:34):**  It covers up a lot of flaws and it has the potential to cover up a lot of damage that  
**[0:52:40-0:52:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:52:40):**  is happening in the ecosystem.  
**[0:52:41-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:52:41):**  It is in and of itself damaging to the ecosystem.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:52:45):**  So I believe it would also be valuable to invest in alternatives to the mainstream synthetic  
**[0:52:52-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:52:52):**  nitrogen fertilization, develop alternatives to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization,  
**[0:52:56-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:52:56):**  for example, which are things that we are working on, have worked on at AEA and we have  
**[0:53:00-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:00):**  some successful products, but there's always the opportunity to develop that more and to  
**[0:53:04-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:04):**  develop products that can out compete and outperform what is available in the current  
**[0:53:11-0:53:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:11):**  mainstream and that could facilitate massive adoption as well.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:16):**  Similarly, developing and investing in producing effective bio controls.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:21):**  This is something that various organizations are already working on.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:24):**  Pam Marone from Marone BioInnovations being one that I know well and I'm sure there are  
**[0:53:28-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:28):**  also others.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:30):**  But when you develop effective treatments, biological type treatments that can compete  
**[0:53:37-0:53:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:37):**  and displace with pesticides, then that removes the need for pesticides and again, changes  
**[0:53:43-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:43):**  the conversation away from pharmaceuticals to a more holistic and integrated approach.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:49):**  But it's still input based, right?  
**[0:53:50-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:50):**  So it does, because I see a lot of two questions, so it's still input based.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:54):**  Let's first tackle that.  
**[0:53:55-0:53:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:55):**  Do you see that as a transition?  
**[0:53:58-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:53:58):**  I wouldn't say fuel because that's, but is it transition towards healthier plants that  
**[0:54:02-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:02):**  don't need it anymore, which is sort of bad for your business.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:05):**  So these companies might be incentivized, even if they really don't want to, to make  
**[0:54:10-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:10):**  sure that you keep buying even the biological.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:13):**  They can facilitate the transition.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:16):**  So I see them as facilitating a transition period to the point where you no longer need  
**[0:54:20-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:20):**  inputs.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:21):**  The challenge with the chemical applications is that, this is something that even many  
**[0:54:25-0:54:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:25):**  farmers don't know, is that when you apply an insecticide or a fungicide onto a crop,  
**[0:54:31-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:31):**  it actually increases that plant's disease and insect susceptibility into the future.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:37):**  Which means you need more.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:39):**  Exactly.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:40):**  The more of them you apply, the more of them you need in the future.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:43):**  The advantage of a biocontrol is that they don't have this effect.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:46):**  They're naturally occurring materials and when you apply them, you can temporarily control  
**[0:54:51-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:51):**  a disease or insect that you perhaps haven't developed the nutritional integrity to resist  
**[0:54:56-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:54:56):**  yet, but you don't increase susceptibility into the future.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:00):**  So they are transition tools that can help growers get to the point where they don't  
**[0:55:03-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:03):**  need those inputs into perpetuity in the future.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:06):**  Okay.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:07):**  That's clear.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:08):**  And then the second question, because I get quite a few emails and maybe other people  
**[0:55:11-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:11):**  in this space as well with companies that are claiming a lot of things in this space,  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:16):**  especially in the, let's say, more regenerative inputs, biological inputs, et cetera.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:21):**  I have a very hard time because I'm not a farmer, I'm not a biologist, I'm not a soil  
**[0:55:24-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:24):**  scientist to see through the noise and to hear through the noise and see what is real  
**[0:55:29-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:29):**  there.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:30):**  What kind of questions should I be asking them?  
**[0:55:32-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:32):**  Because I've on purpose not interviewed many of them on the podcast because I simply don't  
**[0:55:37-0:55:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:37):**  know how to filter and how to screen for what is noise and what is actually interesting.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:43):**  What would be a good set of questions or a good question I should ask them to sort of  
**[0:55:47-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:47):**  start filtering there?  
**[0:55:48-0:55:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:48):**  I think the one most powerful question, and this is in terms of product effectiveness  
**[0:55:54-0:56:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:55:54):**  and performance, which you asked about, it's not a question of how much did it increase  
**[0:56:00-0:56:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:56:00):**  yields in the best case situation, but the question is, of all the various trials that  
**[0:56:07-0:56:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:56:07):**  you ran, what percentage of the time did you observe a beneficial crop response?  
**[0:56:13-0:56:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:56:13):**  That's the key question because agriculture is so variable and is so context dependent,  
**[0:56:20-0:56:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:56:20):**  it's unrealistic to expect any product, even the very best products, to perform 100% of  
**[0:56:27-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:56:27):**  the time unless they are a synthetic material.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:56:30):**  Roundup can have 100% performance.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:56:33):**  Natural materials seldom, if ever, have 100% or have performance 100% of the time.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:56:39):**  It's really a question of what percentage of cases did they improve crop performance?  
**[0:56:46-0:56:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:56:46):**  The better the product is, obviously, the higher the percentage of cases that will be.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:56:50):**  That's a very good question.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:56:52):**  Thank you for that.  
**[0:56:53-0:56:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:56:53):**  I'm going to use it the next time these emails come in.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:56:56):**  You will be surprised.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:56:58):**  Yeah, by the noise, I think.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:57:01):**  That's my hunch already, but I'm going to report back to see if that's true.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:57:08):**  In terms of the portfolio, do you have anything else you wanted to invest in or have we reached  
**[0:57:15-0:57:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:57:15):**  the end of the diversified?  
**[0:57:17-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:57:17):**  Because I think that's crucial.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:57:18):**  Yeah, I will add two more important pieces that I think can add to this ecosystem and  
**[0:57:24-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:57:24):**  add to a diversified portfolio.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:57:26):**  The one is facilitating the development of a brand that describes nutritional integrity  
**[0:57:36-0:57:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:57:36):**  and compensates nutritional integrity, similar to what Blu Blanc Corp has done in France  
**[0:57:42-0:57:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:57:42):**  and surrounding countries.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:57:45):**  Because again, this speaks to producing change in the world by incentivizing people to change.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:57:52):**  If you can give growers an economic incentive to produce healthier, higher quality food,  
**[0:57:56-0:57:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:57:56):**  then they will most certainly do that.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:57:58):**  That almost invariably, the only way that that can be accomplished is in a regenerative  
**[0:58:02-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:58:02):**  manner.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:58:03):**  What Blu Blanc Corp is doing is they're specifically for animal products.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:58:08):**  Just for people that don't know, what is Blu Blanc Corp?  
**[0:58:11-0:58:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:58:11):**  Blu Blanc Corp is a nonprofit organization in France that has conducted hundreds, if  
**[0:58:18-0:58:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:58:18):**  I'm not mistaken, I should say maybe it conducted dozens of studies and published hundreds of  
**[0:58:23-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:58:23):**  peer-reviewed papers on how the nutritional quality of food produces inflammation or anti-inflammatory  
**[0:58:30-0:58:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:58:30):**  reactions in the human body.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:58:33):**  They measure the fatty acid profile of animal products, whether this be beef or poultry  
**[0:58:40-0:58:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:58:40):**  or eggs.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:58:42):**  All of the food that is produced under their label that receives their approval, their  
**[0:58:46-0:58:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:58:46):**  certification is documented to have this.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:58:49):**  It's actually measured and tested to have a certain ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 essential  
**[0:58:53-0:59:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:58:53):**  fatty acids and is known to reduce inflammation, whereas mainstream produced meat that doesn't  
**[0:59:00-0:59:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:00):**  have this fatty acid profile is known to enhance inflammation.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:05):**  Their healthy animal products actually have an anti-inflammatory.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:08):**  It is food as medicine.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:10):**  They've documented that it is food as medicine.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:11):**  Wow.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:12):**  I didn't know it was already there.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:13):**  I need to get them on the show.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:15):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:17):**  They're doing absolutely incredible work.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:19):**  What really impresses me, what they have accomplished that I don't know of anyone else that has  
**[0:59:24-0:59:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:24):**  accomplished is that they have brought together a collective of people within academia, government,  
**[0:59:35-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:35):**  the medical institutions, and the population at large that they have been able to produce  
**[0:59:39-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:39):**  this collective effort where the farmers are compensated for producing higher quality that  
**[0:59:45-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:45):**  is tested and measured and yet the cost to the consumers remains unchanged.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:51):**  It costs exactly the same to the consumer as the conventional product does and they  
**[0:59:57-1:00:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=0:59:57):**  have been able to produce so much momentum around this that the distributors were actually  
**[1:00:03-1:00:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:03):**  willing to take the cut to make up the difference.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:07):**  The farmers now have an economic incentive to produce higher quality and yet the cost  
**[1:00:11-1:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:11):**  of the consumer is the same.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:13):**  This to me is magical.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:15):**  It's incredible because they have now created an engine to the consumer.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:18):**  There's no downside.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:19):**  Yeah.  
**[1:00:20-1:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:20):**  There is no downside.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:21):**  If we can expand the work that they have done to include not just animal products but also  
**[1:00:28-1:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:28):**  to have a conversation about fruits and vegetables and to expand that to... We could begin by  
**[1:00:34-1:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:34):**  expanding it to the developed world and then gradually globally, now you have tremendous  
**[1:00:40-1:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:40):**  incentives not just for the farmers that you are working with directly but in your own  
**[1:00:45-1:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:45):**  portfolio but globally to really produce massive change.  
**[1:00:50-1:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:50):**  And then there's one more piece that I would invest in and then I'll stop at that part  
**[1:00:55-1:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:55):**  of the list.  
**[1:00:56-1:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:00:56):**  We've observed that a significant barrier to entry for many existing farmers who desire  
**[1:01:02-1:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:01:02):**  to adopt regional agriculture practices that they are locked into a banking structure,  
**[1:01:07-1:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:01:07):**  an insurance structure, crop insurance structure that gives them no opportunity to experiment  
**[1:01:14-1:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:01:14):**  with different practices and develop regenerative practices on their farm.  
**[1:01:19-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:01:19):**  They get a bank loan, an operating loan from the bank to purchase seeds and fertilizers  
**[1:01:25-1:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:01:25):**  and as a contingency for the bank loan, they are required or as a covenant for the bank  
**[1:01:32-1:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:01:32):**  loan, they are required to follow the recommended USDA practices.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:01:36):**  So the crop scout, in order to qualify for insurance, they're required to have crop insurance  
**[1:01:42-1:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:01:42):**  and in order to get the crop insurance, they are required to follow USDA standard practices  
**[1:01:48-1:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:01:48):**  for the local region.  
**[1:01:50-1:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:01:50):**  So a crop scout comes out to scout their fields and says that you have this insect, you have  
**[1:01:59-1:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:01:59):**  corn borer and you need to spray this insecticide or you need to spray this fungicide.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:02:04):**  The farmer has no alternatives.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:02:06):**  He is forced to spray the insecticides or the fungicides if he wants to keep his crop  
**[1:02:10-1:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:02:10):**  insurance and if he wants to keep his bank loan and the same is true of cover crops.  
**[1:02:16-1:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:02:16):**  Many farmers would desire to plant cover crops and experiment with cover crops in their operation  
**[1:02:22-1:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:02:22):**  but cover crops are disallowed in the fields within certain time windows in order to qualify  
**[1:02:29-1:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:02:29):**  for crop insurance.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:02:30):**  They have to be out at a certain time in the spring.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:02:33):**  They can't be there while the crop is growing because the USDA considers them to effectively  
**[1:02:37-1:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:02:37):**  be a weed and to limit plant productivity and as a result, bottom line is that the farmers  
**[1:02:44-1:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:02:44):**  which are dependent on bank loans are by default also dependent on crop insurance and that  
**[1:02:51-1:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:02:51):**  really limits their capacity to develop regenerative systems on their farm.  
**[1:02:55-1:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:02:55):**  They're kind of locked into the status quo.  
**[1:02:58-1:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:02:58):**  I would also use some of this billion dollar fund to facilitate the development of alternative  
**[1:03:08-1:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:03:08):**  crop insurance that enhances regenerative farming and actually rewards regenerative  
**[1:03:13-1:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:03:13):**  farming practices rather than suppresses them because there are many rewards.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:03:17):**  We know that when you develop soil health, you have better water infiltration, you are  
**[1:03:21-1:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:03:21):**  more climate resilient, you're more resilient to drought.  
**[1:03:24-1:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:03:24):**  Which is something an insurance company should love.  
**[1:03:27-1:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:03:27):**  Exactly.  
**[1:03:28-1:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:03:28):**  You're more resilient to drought, you're more resilient to excessive rain, you're more resilient  
**[1:03:31-1:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:03:31):**  to frost, you're more resistant to disease and insects.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:03:34):**  These are practices that should be incentivized in the insurance world rather than de-incentivized.  
**[1:03:39-1:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:03:39):**  There is an opportunity from an insurance perspective and from a banking perspective  
**[1:03:45-1:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:03:45):**  to actually be more competitive than the existing insurance and banking landscape.  
**[1:03:51-1:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:03:51):**  That sounds like way more than a billion dollars but thank you so much for, probably it's the  
**[1:03:56-1:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:03:56):**  most profound answer I ever got to this question.  
**[1:04:00-1:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:00):**  You definitely gave it a lot of thought and I think every single one probably can absorb  
**[1:04:04-1:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:04):**  or hopefully can absorb more than a billion.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:06):**  So there is space out there so if anybody listening and somebody has it laying around,  
**[1:04:11-1:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:11):**  definitely go back to the list and get to work.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:13):**  If you would like to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and  
**[1:04:17-1:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:17):**  agriculture, find our video course on investing in regenerativeagriculture.com.com.  
**[1:04:24-1:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:24):**  This course will teach you to understand the opportunities, to get to know the main players,  
**[1:04:28-1:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:28):**  to learn about the main trends and how to evaluate a new investment opportunity, like  
**[1:04:33-1:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:33):**  what kind of questions to ask.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:36):**  Find out more on investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.com.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:41):**  And with that I would like to ask a new question in the podcast that I've never asked before  
**[1:04:46-1:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:46):**  and that has to do with priorities.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:48):**  So I really like to see briefly how you pick your priorities and what you focus on and  
**[1:04:54-1:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:54):**  what not.  
**[1:04:55-1:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:55):**  So I'm sorry we're taking away your fund for now and that's no longer your John Kempf  
**[1:04:58-1:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:58):**  investor hat.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:04:59):**  You unfortunately have to put that off.  
**[1:05:01-1:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:05:01):**  But I see that I can learn a lot from people if I'm asking about their decision making  
**[1:05:06-1:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:05:06):**  framework and I'm using a specific one and ask you to look at it before, which is ITN.  
**[1:05:11-1:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:05:11):**  So importance, tractability and neglectiveness, which is a difficult word to say in a podcast.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:05:16):**  Importance, what's the scale of the problem in the area?  
**[1:05:18-1:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:05:18):**  If all problems in this area could be solved, how much better would the world be?  
**[1:05:22-1:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:05:22):**  Tractability, like how solvable is this and how can we actually trace that and see that?  
**[1:05:28-1:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:05:28):**  And neglectiveness obviously is how neglected is this area?  
**[1:05:32-1:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:05:32):**  So I would like to ask you if you had to pick one thing you can be working on now, but in  
**[1:05:36-1:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:05:36):**  general to focus on how to make RegenErg the norm in 2040.  
**[1:05:42-1:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:05:42):**  Don't consider the budgets, don't consider the billion dollars, et cetera.  
**[1:05:46-1:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:05:46):**  I mean, I'm sorry you lost it.  
**[1:05:47-1:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:05:47):**  But if you look at in terms of importancy, like what's the scale of the problem?  
**[1:05:51-1:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:05:51):**  Like what's the highest importance, the highest tractability, so how the highest solvability  
**[1:05:57-1:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:05:57):**  and the biggest neglect like where nobody else is looking?  
**[1:06:01-1:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:01):**  What would you look at?  
**[1:06:02-1:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:02):**  What would you focus on if you look at that framework?  
**[1:06:04-1:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:04):**  Koen, that is an interesting question and that is a hard one for me to answer.  
**[1:06:09-1:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:09):**  Are you asking the question specifically in the context of the outline that I just gave  
**[1:06:13-1:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:13):**  of the different opportunities?  
**[1:06:15-1:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:15):**  It could be general because the outline obviously looks at how would you put money to work.  
**[1:06:21-1:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:21):**  In this case, it could be as an investor.  
**[1:06:23-1:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:23):**  In this case, I would ask it broader.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:25):**  So actually it could be I would lobby on taking away crop insurance or it could be something  
**[1:06:30-1:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:30):**  absolutely not investor like.  
**[1:06:32-1:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:32):**  But where would you spend your time, your energy, your resources, your brainpower, let's  
**[1:06:37-1:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:37):**  say to get RegenErg to be the norm in 2040 if you had to pick a thing where it's very  
**[1:06:43-1:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:43):**  important like what in terms of scale of the problem and very solvable, at least from what  
**[1:06:48-1:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:48):**  you've seen and very neglected because I think we often follow each other and go for the  
**[1:06:52-1:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:52):**  pieces that are I wouldn't say fancy but more advanced and all this thinking I will link  
**[1:06:57-1:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:06:57):**  that below in the show notes comes from a framework that's wildly used in the effective  
**[1:07:01-1:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:01):**  altruism community.  
**[1:07:02-1:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:02):**  So if you want to play with that, if you want to play with how to choose your focus areas  
**[1:07:06-1:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:06):**  in this specific way, obviously it's a very specific way and there's personal fit as well.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:11):**  Definitely I invite you to look at that.  
**[1:07:12-1:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:12):**  But if I would ask you to for your goal, which is RegenErg the norm in 2040.  
**[1:07:17-1:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:17):**  What do you think is neglected, very important and very solvable?  
**[1:07:21-1:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:21):**  So I'm going to answer your question in this way, perhaps slightly different from the way  
**[1:07:26-1:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:26):**  that you've asked it.  
**[1:07:27-1:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:27):**  I think that I'm very blessed and very fortunate that I have the privilege of working in a  
**[1:07:34-1:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:34):**  space that I very much feel that this is what I am here to do.  
**[1:07:39-1:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:39):**  I have no desire to do anything else and I'm here in this world to facilitate Regenerative  
**[1:07:46-1:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:46):**  Agriculture on scale.  
**[1:07:47-1:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:47):**  So within that context, there are two criteria, one a bit more lighthearted and a question  
**[1:07:55-1:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:55):**  that I ask all the time.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:07:56):**  The question I ask myself quite frequently actually, because I just outlined a list of  
**[1:08:02-1:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:08:02):**  ideas of potential investment opportunities and I have no shortage of ideas, that is for  
**[1:08:07-1:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:08:07):**  sure.  
**[1:08:08-1:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:08:08):**  I've been privileged to have a lot of experience and observe a lot of things happening in the  
**[1:08:13-1:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:08:13):**  field that leads to generating lots of ideas all the time.  
**[1:08:18-1:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:08:18):**  So constantly having to evaluate what do I prioritize and what do I focus on.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:08:23):**  And so the way that I prioritize that to this point is by asking the question of what is  
**[1:08:30-1:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:08:30):**  it that I can bring, what is it that I can do that other people can't do or that other  
**[1:08:36-1:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:08:36):**  people are not doing.  
**[1:08:37-1:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:08:37):**  And so I guess that would speak to your aspect of neglectedness.  
**[1:08:40-1:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:08:40):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:08:41):**  And for myself personally, I think there are the strength that I bring and the gifts that  
**[1:08:47-1:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:08:47):**  I have are the capacity to assimilate a tremendous amount of information in this agronomic context  
**[1:08:55-1:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:08:55):**  and the broader agricultural ecosystems context and understand a lot of detail and at the  
**[1:09:01-1:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:09:01):**  same time see the very high level, I would say a hundred thousand foot view, see kind  
**[1:09:07-1:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:09:07):**  of the global landscape of how these different pieces can produce tremendous change.  
**[1:09:14-1:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:09:14):**  And so within that context specifically, thinking about that gift and that capacity, I asked  
**[1:09:20-1:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:09:20):**  the question, what are the pieces that I can bring to this regenerative agriculture conversation  
**[1:09:24-1:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:09:24):**  with this gift that others can't do?  
**[1:09:28-1:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:09:28):**  And I try to focus all of my activities on doing the things that only I can do and that  
**[1:09:36-1:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:09:36):**  other people can't do or aren't doing.  
**[1:09:39-1:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:09:39):**  So that's the one question that I ask.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:09:41):**  And then the second, which is perhaps coming from a bit of a spiritual place, is I've  
**[1:09:50-1:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:09:50):**  observed and I've learned that when you are in the right frame, in the right mental space,  
**[1:09:59-1:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:09:59):**  in the right spiritual space, the right heart space, however you chose to define it, things  
**[1:10:04-1:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:04):**  just flow.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:05):**  Projects flow smoothly.  
**[1:10:07-1:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:07):**  The right people show up to help bring a project to fruition when they are needed and not before.  
**[1:10:13-1:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:13):**  The money shows up and everything just flows very smoothly and it's a lot of fun.  
**[1:10:19-1:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:19):**  So I try to pay attention to that.  
**[1:10:20-1:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:20):**  I try to pay attention to the different projects and enterprises that I'm working on and just  
**[1:10:24-1:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:24):**  ask the question, okay, what is going really well?  
**[1:10:27-1:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:27):**  What is fun?  
**[1:10:29-1:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:29):**  What am I enjoying a lot?  
**[1:10:31-1:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:31):**  And invariably, I find that when I follow the flow, as I described, people show up,  
**[1:10:39-1:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:39):**  the money shows up, things just that there is an element of serendipity and joy that  
**[1:10:46-1:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:46):**  happens when you allow things to flow smoothly and don't try to force them too hard.  
**[1:10:51-1:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:51):**  And many times there have been projects that I tried to force and there were just a series  
**[1:10:57-1:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:57):**  of missteps.  
**[1:10:58-1:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:10:58):**  I put them on the shelf for a while, a year or two or three later I pick them up and boom,  
**[1:11:03-1:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:11:03):**  away they go.  
**[1:11:04-1:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:11:04):**  Everything just happens smoothly.  
**[1:11:06-1:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:11:06):**  So I don't know, this may not be quite the answer that you were looking for, but in terms  
**[1:11:11-1:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:11:11):**  of how I prioritize and how I focus on contributing and producing the change in the world that  
**[1:11:17-1:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:11:17):**  I seek to make, I pay a lot of attention to those two things.  
**[1:11:21-1:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:11:21):**  No, I think it's a perfect answer and it's exactly why I think these frameworks and questions  
**[1:11:27-1:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:11:27):**  and criteria are so important because we get bombarded with options and optionality and  
**[1:11:34-1:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:11:34):**  shiny things that we could all work on.  
**[1:11:36-1:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:11:36):**  But I think the big challenge and opportunity is what to focus on and how to prioritize  
**[1:11:41-1:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:11:41):**  and how to choose and how to say no.  
**[1:11:43-1:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:11:43):**  And that's why I wanted to ask this question in the framework I use personally, but I'm  
**[1:11:47-1:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:11:47):**  very thankful for you sharing the two main questions you ask when deciding to put your  
**[1:11:53-1:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:11:53):**  precious time and other resources into new projects.  
**[1:11:56-1:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:11:56):**  I think with that we reached a very nice end of this second interview.  
**[1:12:02-1:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:12:02):**  I want to thank you so much, John, for checking in and going very deep.  
**[1:12:08-1:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:12:08):**  And I hope we'll repeat this at some point.  
**[1:12:10-1:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:12:10):**  Thank you for having me.

**[1:15:25-1:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:15:25):**  It's not a list of investable deals.

**[1:15:30-1:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:15:30):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:15:33-1:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/14/john-kempf/#t=1:15:33):**  It's also not investment advice.

**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:00:20):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:00:21):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:00:31):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:00:44):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:00:54):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:00:58):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:01:02):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:01:06):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:01:10):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:01:15):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:01:36):**  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the Planet Mattered.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:01:40):**  In these interviews I'm talking to people who are scaling up the regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:01:44):**  sector either by increasing the inflow of investment capital or by scaling up the enterprises  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:01:50):**  on and in the ground.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:01:51):**  And by doing so exploring what it means to be an impact investor in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:01:56):**  Why am I focused on regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:01:59):**  Because the roots of so many of the issues we're facing in the world today can be found  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:02:03):**  in agriculture.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:02:04):**  From droughts, migrant flows, obesities, social issues, water wars, climate change, hunger,  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:02:10):**  they all have a connection to how we treat the land, grow food and what we eat.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:02:14):**  I hope you will enjoy this interview as much as I did making it.

**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:02:48):**  I'm Koen van Zijen, your host.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:02:49):**  Today I'm talking to Martijn Blom, senior manager investor relationships at Hevos Impact  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:02:53):**  Investment, the impact investment arm of a large Dutch NGO.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:02:57):**  Their Hevos food and lifestyle fund is focused on making investments into food companies  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:03:01):**  in Southern Africa.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:03:02):**  Welcome Martijn!  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:03:03):**  Thank you Koen!  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:03:05):**  So to start with a personal question, how does an entrepreneur end up in making investments  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:03:11):**  into food companies in Southern Africa?  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:03:15):**  I started up years ago as an entrepreneur and while doing that I, you could say, fell  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:03:21):**  in love with the power of entrepreneurship to create things and not just to create economical  
**[0:03:27-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:03:27):**  value but also to create impact value and after I was able to sell my company I started  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:03:34):**  to get involved into investment.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:03:35):**  In the first instance just in any startup that I thought could be, that I could add  
**[0:03:43-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:03:43):**  value to, that I could help scale but growing more and more into impact investments because  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:03:51):**  some of the companies we had were selling water filters to the bottom of the pyramid  
**[0:03:56-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:03:56):**  or even supporting musical artists in Africa to record good records and actually these  
**[0:04:05-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:04:05):**  companies were doing better and were giving me more satisfaction than companies that were  
**[0:04:14-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:04:14):**  just creating an app in the Netherlands.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:04:17):**  And yeah, by that way I got involved into impact investment and even more understood  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:04:23):**  about how you could change society, change the environment for the better, also for the  
**[0:04:29-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:04:29):**  worse but in the case of the companies I invested in for the better and that way actually gradually  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:04:36):**  rolled into investing in food entrepreneurs and understanding more about the problems  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:04:43):**  in the food sector and the things that could be changed there and together with Hevos that  
**[0:04:49-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:04:49):**  has a long lasting reputation on supporting food entrepreneurs and whole food ecosystems  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:04:58):**  started to invest in food entrepreneurs.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:05:00):**  And can you describe a bit what's your role at Hevos Impact Investments, how did that  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:05:08):**  start because you actually helped them set it up and what the food and lifestyle fund  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:05:12):**  is focused on?  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:05:14):**  Yes of course, Hevos back in the days was looking out for getting involved into impact  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:05:21):**  investment, they wanted to innovate and find new ways on how they could reach their goals  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:05:27):**  and impact investment was one of the DIDs that they were exploring and I got into touch  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:05:34):**  with Hevos at about the same moment that I realized that investing directly into companies  
**[0:05:40-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:05:40):**  in the developing world was what I liked and what I did best and what I had most passion  
**[0:05:48-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:05:48):**  for but also having trouble to actually coach the entrepreneurs on such a distance and wanting  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:05:55):**  to make a bigger impact, wanting to create a bigger portfolio than I was able to make  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:06:00):**  by myself together with my business partner at the time.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:06:03):**  So when I decided I wanted to get involved in investment in more a fund type structure,  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:06:09):**  Hevos was coming with me and they were saying yeah we are looking into impact investment,  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:06:14):**  how could we and should we and those two moments kind of came together at a certain moment  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:06:19):**  as it happens.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:06:20):**  So we helped Hevos, we advised them on how they could set up an impact fund and then  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:06:27):**  we implemented that and when I helped design and build the house I wanted to live in it  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:06:32):**  as well.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:06:33):**  So now together with Jaap Spreeuwenberg, part of the main team of Hevos Impact Investments,  
**[0:06:40-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:06:40):**  Jaap is our CEO, he is mostly related to all the reporting towards Hevos the foundation  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:06:47):**  as well as monitoring and managing the investment process.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:06:53):**  My role is more on the investor side because of my background in the Investors Club network  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:06:59):**  of Business Angels in the Netherlands and wider in the whole network of impact investors  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:07:06):**  and that's how we together are building this organization right now.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:07:11):**  And some, because you set up two different funds, one of them is the Food and Lifestyle  
**[0:07:16-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:07:16):**  Fund, what's the theory of change with the investment thesis of that fund?  
**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:07:23):**  We want to invest in early stage companies, post revenue, pre scale, exactly that level  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:07:30):**  of companies that we've invested in, that I've invested in before when I was active  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:07:35):**  more as a business angel.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:07:37):**  In the food sector where we aim for four types of impact, the obvious one when you're investing  
**[0:07:45-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:07:45):**  in countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe is that we want to create more and better  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:07:52):**  and more diverse jobs, work floors.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:07:57):**  So we both look to the growth of the type of jobs, we both look to the growth of the  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:08:01):**  number of jobs, we look to the quality of the types of jobs, we look to the people that  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:08:06):**  are employed and we look to the diversity of the people that we employ.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:08:12):**  And the other three are more on content and on food and we aim to resolve three problems  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:08:20):**  that are widespread in Africa, one is food loss.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:08:24):**  So the second is more on bringing closer together the producers with the market, so making it  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:08:31):**  able for retailers to communicate with small holder farmers so that we have one app for  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:08:38):**  example that's called Greenfingers Mobile that really brings together the retailers  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:08:43):**  in the bigger markets in South Africa with small holder farmers in for example Malawi  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:08:48):**  and Mozambique to source, to make it easier for the retailers to source their products  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:08:54):**  from the hinterland and actually getting better prices for the small holders in the backland.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:08:59):**  But you could also think tracking devices or stuff like that.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:09:05):**  The other two things that we, the two ways that we look to make impact are more geared  
**[0:09:12-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:09:12):**  towards regenerative I guess, which is soils, we want to help create better soils, so on  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:09:19):**  the one hand preventing soils to degrade and the second thing is actually support soils  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:09:26):**  to get better by actually investing in companies that source product or sell product or bring  
**[0:09:32-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:09:32):**  to market products that could help create better soils in the beginning of the chain.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:09:40):**  And the second thing is that we want to create more healthier diets locally, so bring back  
**[0:09:45-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:09:45):**  authentic and local food and local grains and kind of fight the monocultures that are  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:09:55):**  more and more in case in these countries.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:09:59):**  So what I heard for example is that in Malawi 80%, 80% of all the vegetables that are being  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:10:06):**  produced on the land is mice, 80%.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:10:10):**  And this is while there are a wide number of varieties, local varieties of grain that  
**[0:10:17-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:10:17):**  are kind of got lost in the, over the years and by creating more awareness on healthy  
**[0:10:25-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:10:25):**  foods and nutrients, but not just telling it in the NGO way, it's better you eat these  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:10:33):**  kind of grains, but actually create companies that make a brand that people want to go for  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:10:37):**  because they want to create a better and more healthy life for themselves.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:10:43):**  In that way promoting and making local grain sorts cool again if you will.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:10:49):**  Which is a movement that seems to be happening all around the world.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:10:53):**  How do you, I mean you alerted a bit, how do you create a company or how do you invest  
**[0:10:58-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:10:58):**  in a company around that, for instance in Malawi on local cool grains or cool seeds?  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:11:07):**  I think if you're on the retail side of things, which we do, which is the one end of what  
**[0:11:12-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:11:12):**  we look at, then you see those movements grow particularly in the cities.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:11:19):**  So the big cities in South Africa, Cape Town and Johannesburg, but also to a lesser extent  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:11:23):**  in Zambia and Lusaka or in Zimbabwe, in Harare.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:11:29):**  You see these movements of more healthy, more biological, more organic food movements come  
**[0:11:36-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:11:36):**  up as well.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:11:37):**  You see the companies providing those vegetables as well.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:11:40):**  So it's on the retail side, it's investing in those companies that are managing to make  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:11:48):**  green food, organic food cool again and actually that way creating a market.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:11:54):**  So it becomes more than just this is organic and healthy, it becomes it's organic and healthy  
**[0:11:58-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:11:58):**  and cool.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:11:59):**  That's the type of companies we want to support because we think and we believe it's our theory  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:12:05):**  of change that these companies are the front runners of the change you want to see in these  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:12:09):**  urban societies.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:12:12):**  You're not reaching everybody with this movement.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:12:19):**  So what you see is that a lot of these companies are also talking to more government programs.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:12:26):**  Definitely if you look at the more poor countries like Zimbabwe and Malawi to that extent, and  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:12:31):**  it's about school feeding.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:12:33):**  And if you can bring in little changes into the school feeding program, so these kids  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:12:37):**  get something else than mice in some schools at least, then you're making a change step  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:12:43):**  by step.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:12:44):**  But it's a growing movement that we can scale on.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:12:49):**  And then the second thing is also because we're not only on the retail side of things,  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:12:54):**  but we also look to companies that can actually help farmers to produce these new type of  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:13:00):**  vegetables and actually all type of vegetables, but this new type compared to the compared  
**[0:13:06-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:13:06):**  to the mice economy, if you will.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:13:08):**  And that's actually by investing in companies that are providing stuff to the farms to make  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:13:19):**  this possible.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:13:20):**  So for example, we had a big event around seed companies, where there's a lot of local  
**[0:13:25-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:13:25):**  seed companies from Malawi and Zimbabwe actually came together to discuss with each other how  
**[0:13:32-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:13:32):**  they could bring more local seeds to the market and actually increase the demand for local  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:13:40):**  seeds.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:13:41):**  So you get these local grains back on the fields again, because that's where it starts.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:13:46):**  And the good thing to see actually, because I had a chance to look a bit into their economics  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:13:52):**  in the past weeks, is that these companies are rather big.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:13:56):**  They are in revenue, they are already a lot bigger than many of the startups and the innovative  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:14:04):**  companies that we have looked at.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:14:06):**  On the other hand, comes that you see that there is some lack of knowledge in some of  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:14:12):**  these companies in order how can they scale?  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:14:14):**  So they have a decent business on a certain level that is already quite respectable, but  
**[0:14:19-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:14:19):**  they have been on that level for many years and if you ask questions on how they strategize  
**[0:14:30-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:14:30):**  their growth to the future, which I think in this case is really important that these  
**[0:14:33-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:14:33):**  companies can scale because only then you can create, you can in Malawi for example,  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:14:40):**  say that that's not 20% that is grown by local vegetables or local grains, but you can make  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:14:46):**  that 30 or 40% and even go up.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:14:50):**  For that to happen it needs the companies to scale, but if you ask questions about their  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:14:53):**  strategizing that there's still a lot of silence I would say.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:14:59):**  These people rather don't answer than say they don't know.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:02):**  So there's a big challenge for us in that type of companies and investing in that type  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:09):**  of companies.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:10):**  And a huge opportunity I imagine, because this event was organized by Hivo, so I think  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:14):**  it shows a nice cooperation or how a big NGO works together with in this case their investment  
**[0:15:19-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:19):**  arm.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:20):**  But of course now the work starts as the investment team and the Impact Investment Fund is how  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:24):**  do you invest in these companies that don't have a perfect growth plan and a 40 slide  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:30):**  PowerPoint deck ready as some of the startups might have.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:34):**  Now exactly that sums up our problems sometimes exactly.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:38):**  And I think you can only work in these countries if you have a large organization on the ground  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:43):**  in our case an NGO because they are there for a long time.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:46):**  They have worked with these companies for a long time.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:49):**  They've built a relationship with them.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:50):**  So the trust already is more or less there.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:15:55):**  Although their working together was mostly into grants sometimes, programs very often,  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:16:00):**  knowledge sharing, these type of things, but never around investment.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:16:04):**  So there's a lot of new developments that need to be discussed and this is really a  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:16:11):**  new way, us coming in as investors, really a new way of cooperating for these organizations  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:16:17):**  and will work for some and won't work for others.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:16:20):**  And the good things is so we have the long lasting relationship because of the Hivo Foundation.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:16:26):**  We know them.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:16:27):**  We are quite easy to get.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:16:28):**  It's quite easy for us to get on the table and then we need to find out which one actually  
**[0:16:32-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:16:32):**  have the ambition to scale and to bring this to a larger scale so we can really become  
**[0:16:39-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:16:39):**  the anti-Monsanto of Southern Africa and want to join us in that effort.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:16:46):**  And that means that we need to work together and actually educate each other.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:16:56):**  So we as investors educate them on what we are looking for and how that would work and  
**[0:17:02-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:17:02):**  how they could scale together with us and how we could help them in that.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:17:05):**  And on the other hand, they could educate us like how they've been working so far and  
**[0:17:11-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:17:11):**  if that new scaling is something they ambition and would fit into the local culture.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:17:18):**  So that's quite an exciting engagement with each other that takes investing in these countries,  
**[0:17:25-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:17:25):**  makes it a bit more difficult than investing anywhere else in the world or makes it more  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:17:28):**  difficult than invest in this part in the world in the more innovative companies, if  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:17:34):**  you will, or the more tech type companies that are already more aware of what investors  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:17:39):**  are looking at.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:17:40):**  But on the other hand, that's also where you can make a difference, where you can make  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:17:45):**  the change.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:17:46):**  We haven't decided yet, that's the other thing, we haven't decided yet on how to approach  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:17:50):**  that exactly.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:17:51):**  So it might be that we are for now also discussing with the foundation like can we bring together  
**[0:17:58-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:17:58):**  programs on getting investor ready and what it is about and what are the documents you  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:18:05):**  need to also provide a good investment case to RIC to actually make an investment possible  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:18:11):**  and having an investor in, what would that mean for them?  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:18:13):**  So they have a complete overview to be able to say if that would be the future step for  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:18:19):**  them as well.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:18:21):**  The second is we also might just make that first investment to get into a company to  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:18:28):**  get to know how they work and to get to know which product actually works and would help  
**[0:18:32-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:18:32):**  us to bring things to scale together, which is a bit more risky, but being personal and  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:18:40):**  speaking outside of the Hefos box, I think that would be a way forward as well because  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:18:47):**  sometimes you just need to start doing and if you do that with small amounts it's a calculated  
**[0:18:52-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:18:52):**  risk I think you could and should take definitely while working with these companies.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:18:59):**  And there's obviously a lot of learnings there.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:19:02):**  And I would love to dive a bit deeper into the school feeding as well.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:19:06):**  I think it's a very interesting angle not only because of the scale of the potential  
**[0:19:10-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:19:10):**  impact but also the scale of the amount of children in any given southern African country  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:19:17):**  that are eating every day at school.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:19:18):**  What are your, have you made an investment there?  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:19:21):**  Are you looking at it?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:19:22):**  What are your interactions at the moment there?  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:19:25):**  What made you look into that?  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:19:28):**  If you look at companies that are making products that process products that come from grain  
**[0:19:34-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:19:34):**  or maize or that type of corn based products, then school feeding programs are always one  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:19:43):**  of the big secure income.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:19:46):**  So a lot of these companies when they start next to trying to get that product with a  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:19:51):**  hip logo in the supermarket is that they also look into these programs because they can  
**[0:19:56-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:19:56):**  provide for these companies in these countries a very stable long term income.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:20:04):**  If you are looking into these more organic and more local grains and bringing those back,  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:20:08):**  if you can do that at the school level that would mean that people in a later stage also  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:20:12):**  when they are maybe less impact minded could keep on continue using that product because  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:20:19):**  it's also about habits and what people learn to eat and what people like to eat.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:20:23):**  So if you can bring in this new organic and local foods, if you want to make them more  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:20:28):**  common again for everybody to use then if you can reach children in an early stage they  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:20:34):**  might want to get back to these products when they grow up.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:20:38):**  So it's also for reasons of increasing this market and fighting maize model culture.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:20:49):**  It's an interesting one.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:20:50):**  The thing that we run into sometimes as well is that these school feeding programs are  
**[0:20:58-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:20:58):**  heavily subsidized often UN based in some countries, sometimes government based.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:21:05):**  So there are also some dependency issues that make it less interesting for the companies  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:21:14):**  to actually create better qualities because people are buying it anyway.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:21:21):**  To do the effort of actually launching the product in the supermarket for broader markets  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:21:29):**  because if you have the base income there is sometimes not a necessity to also bring  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:21:35):**  a product to the market which is actually what is interesting as well.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:21:39):**  And because these companies get a more secure type of income it also leads that some companies  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:21:47):**  are just happy with the school feeding program income that they have and there's no ambition  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:21:52):**  to scale that further or to bring it to the next level anymore.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:21:55):**  So you really, the school feeding is an interesting thing for all companies working in the corn  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:21:59):**  and maize and industries in these countries.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:22:04):**  So you should definitely look at that.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:22:06):**  Also if you're looking to the more organic companies but then you need to have the right  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:22:10):**  entrepreneur with the right skill set that actually knows how to leverage the secure  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:22:15):**  base of income to use that to scale also the other products.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:22:21):**  But that's a bit my opinion.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:22:22):**  So there's a lot of advantages to it and there's some disadvantages that come with it as well.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:22:28):**  Like it's usually the case actually.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:22:29):**  Yes, that's always the case.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:22:31):**  So actually to make a small jump because you did invest in a company not based on school  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:22:39):**  feeding programs etc. but based on tea.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:22:41):**  Can you explain a bit on that side why did you make that investment and why it is an  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:22:46):**  interesting example of better processing of interesting companies you can find in southern  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:22:52):**  Africa?  
**[0:22:53-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:22:53):**  Yes, this is a lady in South Africa that actually originally came from media, decided to start  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:23:02):**  a company in the product that she loves which is tea.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:23:07):**  She has the potential because she comes from media, she has a bit of potential to become  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:23:12):**  the South African Jamie Oliver of tea.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:23:15):**  So there's also a great media potential on what can be done.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:23:22):**  But for us the reason to invest in this company really is that she's able to make a very,  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:23:28):**  very, very high end, high quality product from wild rooibos tea.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:23:35):**  In that way because she knows how to source the best quality of rooibos tea, she can provide  
**[0:23:42-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:23:42):**  better income to the corporations that create these organic rooibos.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:23:49):**  Rooibos is a wild plant, it's hard to cultivate.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:23:53):**  You need to keep the landscape as it is, you need the landscape up.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:23:59):**  If you cut the tea plants, it's hard to put them back.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:24:06):**  It's an original and local plant.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:24:07):**  So that's all the things that I love.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:24:11):**  What you see however is that much, the vast majority of rooibos and wildbos leaves the  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:24:17):**  country in South Africa as a commodity.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:24:22):**  A commodity where there's more and more needs.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:24:24):**  So people tend to pick too much or pick leaves that are too early.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:24:30):**  So the quality is a typical commodity problem.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:24:33):**  The quality becomes less of a thing than the quantity.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:24:39):**  And actually by creating this high quality tea locally, it's getting the best value for  
**[0:24:46-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:24:46):**  the best of what the products can offer.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:24:48):**  That's one thing.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:24:49):**  And the second is actually processing it to all different kinds of plants with local herbs  
**[0:24:55-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:24:55):**  that create some very beautiful high end teas and actually adding the value locally in South  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:25:02):**  Africa.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:25:03):**  So if it's exported, all the added value is created in South Africa itself, which generates  
**[0:25:10-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:25:10):**  again employment, economic development, but on a very good product in the first place.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:25:22):**  And actually helping this lady to scale her company has been quite an opportunity and  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:25:28):**  quite a fun journey so far.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:25:31):**  And to look at the journey of the fund and the journey of your work, if you look at one  
**[0:25:38-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:25:38):**  year ago compared to now, what has changed both internally but also in the wider field  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:25:48):**  of where you're working?  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:25:49):**  Have you seen a big change both in the fund and also in let's say food and agriculture  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:25:54):**  in Southern Africa?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:25:58):**  The first question is quite easy to answer.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:26:00):**  So I think we are more able to create better quality of deal flow than a year ago.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:26:10):**  And on the second hand, also, we are better able to see, realize and also address the  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:26:20):**  problems of investing in some of these companies.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:26:24):**  So both identifying the opportunity and addressing the risks and investing in these companies  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:26:34):**  has gone a lot better.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:26:36):**  So the whole program of supporting entrepreneurship by Heavos Foundation wasn't there to the extent  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:26:43):**  that it is now a year ago.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:26:45):**  And now we already had a couple of these events bringing together on a certain team, so seeds  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:26:49):**  and processing companies from the region where we invest together and actually discuss on  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:26:56):**  an open level also with them the opportunities of what we can bring as investors and what  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:27:02):**  they should be able to bring in for being able to invest.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:27:06):**  So the conversation is ongoing and the ways best to address are something that we will  
**[0:27:14-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:27:14):**  unravel in the next year.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:27:17):**  But yeah, we have a lot wider area and able to generate more high quality deal flow and  
**[0:27:28-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:27:28):**  also see the opportunity sometimes beyond all the documents that we need.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:27:36):**  For example, like I explained with the seed companies.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:27:41):**  So that really changed within the fund, but also changed within the fund that we've been  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:27:45):**  able to address more investors.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:27:47):**  So that's nice.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:27:49):**  That's also a challenge for the next year to actually being able to get the fund to  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:27:53):**  15 to 50 million where we targeted to be.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:27:58):**  In the wider food system of South Africa, that's a bit more difficult.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:28:06):**  What I've learned personally more and more and which for some of the listeners and definitely  
**[0:28:11-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:28:11):**  for you Coen is already something you've known for a long time, but it's actually the added  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:28:19):**  value I would say, I would almost call it the added value in impact on the phenomenon  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:28:24):**  of soil.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:28:27):**  When I learned about soils, and we put it in as one of our impact because the people  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:28:33):**  at Tivon said soil is really important.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:28:35):**  I thought, yeah, the soil must be important because if you can't grow anything on poor  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:28:40):**  soils then how can you support agriculture?  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:28:45):**  This was a bit of the beginning, but talking to you and talking to other people that are  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:28:50):**  in the food movement, also talking to the people within the heath of spore and more,  
**[0:28:55-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:28:55):**  makes me realize that soil next to water and clean energy is one of the big topics actually  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:29:02):**  to fight climate change.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:29:04):**  But also soil is one of the main providers of the actual nutrients and actually those  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:29:14):**  nutrients that make our food more healthy and more tasty.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:29:20):**  So the importance of having good soils and keeping good soils and regenerating good soils  
**[0:29:25-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:29:25):**  is something that has really changed in last year.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:29:34):**  There's really a knowledge that it's evolved in myself over the last year, which makes  
**[0:29:39-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:29:39):**  me more eager to really find a company that more directly can address to this problem  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:29:47):**  over the next year.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:29:48):**  It's something I hope to achieve in the next year.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:29:52):**  It's very exciting and I definitely will check in.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:29:55):**  I think a lot of investors are looking for those type of companies in all different places.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:01):**  How can you put money to work to build soils in a way that makes sense both for the soil,  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:06):**  the farmer, the company and the investor?  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:09):**  That puzzle is not an easy one as we've seen and heard many, many times in these podcasts,  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:14):**  but it's definitely a crucial one.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:18):**  It's very exciting to follow that.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:20):**  And so to put your investor or also your entrepreneur head on actually, what do you see as the two  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:26):**  or even one of the most important barriers for investing in this space in regenerative  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:31):**  agriculture?  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:33):**  What would be needed to get this to a much broader scale and not just the in-crowd that  
**[0:30:39-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:39):**  we always talk to?  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:41):**  I think that's a difficult one because it's also about knowledge and habits and how people  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:47):**  look at food and look at nutrition.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:52):**  If you see one grain from the other, you need to be an expert to know that one grain has  
**[0:30:58-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:58):**  far more nutrients than the other.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:30:59):**  So it's really about educating on the one hand and I think about marketing on the other  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:31:07):**  hand as well.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:31:08):**  If you can make it more cool, if you can actually build on the healthy movements that you see  
**[0:31:14-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:31:14):**  around the world, that could be an interesting opportunity to bring this food sector to a  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:31:22):**  next level and also to find companies where you can invest in as an investor.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:31:27):**  I think on the other hand, what you see because you have this in-crowd of people as you call  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:31:31):**  it that is already working on these topics is that for an investor, you already have  
**[0:31:37-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:31:37):**  quite a lot of different products with different revenue prospects with different possibilities  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:31:44):**  that you can build your portfolio around this topic already quite well.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:31:50):**  Many of these investment organizations are early stage or starting as an investment opportunity,  
**[0:31:57-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:31:57):**  but there's quite a lot of different, more long term, more mezzanine based or more on  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:32:06):**  the end companies that actually sell it to the market like we do with Hivos.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:32:10):**  But there are different stages and different possibilities to invest in soils and in regenerative  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:32:19):**  agriculture already.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:32:20):**  I think if you want to.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:32:22):**  It's making it more popular or making it more common knowledge like the clean energy sector  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:32:27):**  that will be the barrier and the challenge because clean energy, everybody knows about  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:32:31):**  clean energy now and everybody also knows that the discussing about what is getting  
**[0:32:38-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:32:38):**  you the best value for money is almost becoming a no brainer quicker and quicker.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:32:46):**  That's because we learned and that's because the market developed and that's because the  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:32:50):**  technology behind it developed.  
**[0:32:52-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:32:52):**  And I think that knowledge and market needs to go through the same process and advocating  
**[0:33:01-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:01):**  it will help getting also the knowledge about soil being one of the new big topics getting  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:13):**  out.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:14):**  The whole thing that now I can't find his name.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:19):**  The American movie star that has made soil his main concerns that will definitely help  
**[0:33:25-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:25):**  to make it more popular.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:26):**  Leonardo DiCaprio.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:27):**  Leonardo DiCaprio.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:28):**  Of course.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:29):**  Of course.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:30):**  Who else could it be?  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:31):**  So I completely agree.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:33):**  I think the movement, although it's a much more technical thing, the renewable energy  
**[0:33:38-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:38):**  movement, but offers great parallels to what needs to be done or what could happen in the  
**[0:33:45-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:45):**  next few decades around soil.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:47):**  I mean, the first solar panels were a horrible investment.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:51):**  They still working in many cases.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:52):**  So actually they weren't that bad, but the payback times were interesting.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:33:56):**  They went through a lot of booms and busts and the big money came in.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:01):**  But now I'm able to invest 25 euros or 50 euros or 100 or 200 into very different platforms,  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:11):**  products to put money to work in renewable energy.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:14):**  So that market has come.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:15):**  Although still, I mean, if you look at the percentages, we're here at the moment in the  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:19):**  Netherlands, I think we're at six or seven maximum of percentage of renewable energy  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:23):**  on the total mix.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:24):**  So there's a lot of work to be done, but at least for investors, as you said, that's not  
**[0:34:29-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:29):**  completely the case in soil and regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:32):**  But there are hundreds of options to put your money to work in different risk, return technology,  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:38):**  places and all of that.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:39):**  And in soil, it starts to come.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:41):**  I see a lot of people starting up funds and vehicles.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:44):**  I see a lot of people buying land.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:45):**  I see a lot of people looking at organic micro-eats, additives that you can spray on your soil plants  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:54):**  that are completely regenerative and make them go up faster.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:34:59):**  I see food processing companies that try to make soil sexy and put it actually in supermarkets  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:04):**  and say soil matters.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:05):**  And you think, OK, that's something weird.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:07):**  We've never seen that before.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:08):**  So there's this whole, but yeah, it's the same discussion.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:11):**  We're at 0.01 percent or something of the market and of the land.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:17):**  But you can definitely plot a lot of these same moments that are that that were maybe  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:23):**  when we were at the beginning of the renewable energy, we thought we'll never get there.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:28):**  And now we can see that theoretically we can get there and you see it speeding up.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:34):**  You can see it.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:35):**  You can see it coming and you can you can see more more innovative ways of financing  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:40):**  these type of soil developments.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:41):**  But you can also see more people that have that have a lot of that have a lot of land  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:49):**  in which and where they want to create better, better soils upon that they they get different  
**[0:35:53-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:53):**  earning models as well.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:55):**  So there are some investments to be made.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:35:56):**  It's not just the products that come from the land, but also the knowledge around it  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:36:01):**  can help governments.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:36:04):**  I heard the story about actually in the Netherlands that the soils that are better, that have  
**[0:36:10-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:36:10):**  more organic matter work better to kind of absorb water.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:36:14):**  So you can actually help create you can actually keep the the the the grounds and the and the  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:36:22):**  soils for agriculture while it would absorb more more water.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:36:27):**  So you don't have to give back to nature.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:36:31):**  You just can work the land in a more nature full way and that would also absorb more water.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:36:38):**  So the government will also be paying to get these experiments to a next level.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:36:42):**  And if you can invest in those lands, that's almost like that's almost like a real estate  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:36:46):**  investor.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:36:47):**  And the investment type don't even becomes new then.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:36:51):**  They also have people like that are working with blockchain or with new ways of financing  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:36:57):**  or or intermediate ways of financing or more long term, the forestry investments that we  
**[0:37:03-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:37:03):**  have that we've heard of.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:37:05):**  And if you put that together, you can see that you can build a very diverse asset class  
**[0:37:08-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:37:08):**  already with type of things that can help you regenerate soil or to protect soil or  
**[0:37:15-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:37:15):**  to be active in a very organic way of of agriculture that can actually make a difference and doesn't  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:37:25):**  necessarily have to is definitely more healthy and doesn't necessarily have to be less productive  
**[0:37:31-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:37:31):**  than than what's happening in the regular or should I say old fashioned chemical?  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:37:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:37:39):**  So actually, that's a perfect end question.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:37:44):**  There's a there's a full room of smart impact investors that are that are on the journey  
**[0:37:48-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:37:48):**  of understanding soil and the potential and potential and regenerative agriculture, et  
**[0:37:54-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:37:54):**  cetera.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:37:55):**  What should they look out for?  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:37:58):**  Where would you not giving them investment advice, obviously, but where should they start  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:02):**  if they are listening to this?  
**[0:38:03-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:03):**  And yeah, yeah, of course, I what's a what's a nice start of the journey?  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:11):**  The boring question would be look at your own investment strategy and kind of look at  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:15):**  which products there that that fit that.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:17):**  Because if you're a more long term patient investor, then definitely just invest in the  
**[0:38:21-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:21):**  lands that are being regenerated.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:23):**  Right.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:24):**  So that's that's kind of it's also kind of what what an investor really wants to as his  
**[0:38:28-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:28):**  own strategy.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:29):**  It's a bit of the boring answer.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:30):**  But what I would say is that another part of that would be to clean up your portfolio  
**[0:38:33-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:33):**  first and see where you're not regenerating soils for sure, like fossil fuels and none  
**[0:38:39-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:39):**  way work against it mining.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:42):**  Where are you working against it?  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:43):**  Mining literally or mining in agriculture or some fossil fuel companies that probably  
**[0:38:48-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:48):**  are part of it?  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:49):**  Yes.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:50):**  Not as an investment advice, of course, but divest from Monsanto a buyer, for example.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:56):**  That might help.  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:57):**  Do two at the same moment.  
**[0:38:58-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:58):**  That might help.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:38:59):**  Yeah, it's probably the same the same share right now.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:03):**  So it makes it easy.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:06):**  But yeah, there's of course, there's a lot to do.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:09):**  But I think it's also the fun thing actually is if you want to kind of put your toe in  
**[0:39:13-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:13):**  the water in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:16):**  That's probably a lot of that's probably a product that fits the rest of your product.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:20):**  So that fits what you're familiar with.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:22):**  So so what we are we are doing at Heavis Impact investment is really to invest in early stage  
**[0:39:28-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:28):**  companies.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:29):**  That's because of my background as an entrepreneur and a business angel.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:31):**  And how can you regenerate soils if you are investing into these early stage companies  
**[0:39:37-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:37):**  that need to scale and stuff like that?  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:39):**  That can only be done if you are if you are considering if you look at soils from from  
**[0:39:44-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:44):**  a complete organic agricultural value chain from from from soil to soil to fork, if you  
**[0:39:53-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:53):**  want to call it that way.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:55):**  And then and then you can invest in the companies that are actually providing the seeds, for  
**[0:39:59-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:39:59):**  example, as we mentioned, or that are processing everything that comes from the land to a product  
**[0:40:05-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:40:05):**  that makes it new and cool and good again to eat to eat this healthy, local, authentic  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:40:13):**  foods.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:40:14):**  The baobab always remains remains like this big story, I think.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:40:20):**  It's a it's a it's a fruit that they were actually considered by the by the local people  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:40:25):**  everywhere as as poor people's food, but it had an amount of nutrients in it that's that's  
**[0:40:30-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:40:30):**  unknown.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:40:31):**  It has like 12 times the amount of vitamin C as as an orange, I was told.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:40:38):**  So there's there's a lot of a lot of health to be to be captured from these from these  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:40:42):**  fruits that were just laying rotten on the field while the farmers were building mice.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:40:48):**  And that that's that's a way if you can if you can bring the end product of this baobab  
**[0:40:54-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:40:54):**  or the baobab powder, if you can can actually brand that in such a way that it becomes a  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:41:00):**  nice taste enhancer for people that want to live more healthy or you can add it to the  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:41:06):**  to the school feeding program so you can get porridge with with a bit of a bit of a bit  
**[0:41:11-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:41:11):**  of a vitamin orange like taste to it.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:41:15):**  You're actually doing you're actually doing it all.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:41:18):**  You're providing more income to the farmers without them having to do much more extra  
**[0:41:23-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:41:23):**  work.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:41:24):**  You get healthier, healthier diets on schools and in the supermarkets and you can create  
**[0:41:30-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:41:30):**  a company that could actually make make quite a good return from from actually processing  
**[0:41:36-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:41:36):**  these these baobab fruits.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:41:38):**  So there's a lot of opportunities also within the company investments, but they are they  
**[0:41:43-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/23/martijn-blom/#t=0:41:43):**  are broader there as well.

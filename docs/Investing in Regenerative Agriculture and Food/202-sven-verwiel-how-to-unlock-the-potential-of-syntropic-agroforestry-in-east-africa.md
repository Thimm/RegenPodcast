### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course, or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:00:14):**  Unbacking the potential of syntropic agroforestry in Kenya and what we can learn from the over  40 year experience in Brazil and what is needed to apply this at scale in the local East African  context.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:00:25):**  And why is the African continent the crucial and most interesting place to apply regenerative  practices?  Plus some conversations about the role and place of annuals like cereals in syntropic  
**[0:00:36-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:00:36):**  agroforestry and why investing in unlocking water is the most important thing to do now  or actually yesterday.  Plus some thoughts on water cycles.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:00:46):**  Enjoy  This is the investing in regenerative agriculture and food podcast investing as if the planet  mattered where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:59-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:00:59):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:11-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:01:11):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:24-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:01:24):**  attention to the dirt soil underneath our feet.  To make it easy for fans to support our work, we launched our membership community and so  many of you have joined us as a member.

**[0:02:02-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:02:02):**  brand that utilizes centropic agroforestry.  They combine a wide variety of indigenous and commercial produce to recreate natural  biodiversity, replenish soil health and grow food with high nutritional value.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:02:15):**  Welcome co-founder and director Sven.  Thank you very much Koen.  It's a pleasure to be here.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:02:21):**  It really is.  And as you know, you're a fan of the podcast.  You've listened to a few episodes.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:02:27):**  We always start with a personal question.  Why soil?  How did you end up in a centropic agroforestry in Kenya?  
**[0:02:35-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:02:35):**  Yeah, well, I actually grew up with food in restaurants as my parents are in the hospitality  sector and but at the same time I had a big passion for spending time on the ocean in  the African wildlife and in forests, surfing, fishing, diving.  
**[0:02:52-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:02:52):**  So I was quite connected to the natural world.  And then yeah, I always really had a thirst to understand the world from a biological  perspective.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:03:02):**  So I thought, how can we marry environmental regeneration with sound food production?  And that was really where it all started.  I then went and did a degree in aquaculture and fisheries management, but it didn't really  
**[0:03:16-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:03:16):**  matter what module I was doing.  It was all monocultures from fin fish to bivalves and crustacea, algae.  It was all just mono.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:03:24):**  We did a little bit on the integrated multi trophic level stuff and biofloc.  So that really led me into my dissertation in aquaponics and into my sort of first intro  to the permaculture world.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:03:39):**  And that's really what led me then to the soils because I wanted to come back home after  studying abroad.  And at home, aquaculture was really in its infancy and you only really had sort of tilapia  
**[0:03:50-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:03:50):**  and catfish to choose from.  And so that permaculture world opened up a lot of doors for me.  I started off our own consultancy and training company straight out of uni.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:04:05):**  And so that really led to where we are today and everything I've done in the last 10 years  since I finished and into what we're now focusing on heavily is, you know, with forest foods  is the centropic agroforestry, but also with our other company, Leaf Africa, working on  
**[0:04:21-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:04:21):**  getting larger scale regen projects off the ground in this part of the world.  So that's what led me to this oil really in a nutshell.  And I mean, if you study agriculture, but also aquaculture, like you mentioned, the  
**[0:04:38-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:04:38):**  track to go into or the path, let's say, or the path dependency to go into monoculture  is very, very strong.  Do you remember what triggered or how you stumbled upon permaculture?  
**[0:04:51-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:04:51):**  Because I can imagine there wasn't a permaculture class in your aquaculture studies.  Like what was the path that you took left or right out of this beaten path that normally  leads to large monoculture farms?  
**[0:05:06-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:05:06):**  Yeah, no, good question.  I mean, we're lucky enough that you need to be able to do two placements every year.  And that's sort of led me all across the world.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:05:16):**  And I did meet some very influential characters, I would say, who introduced me to that permaculture  concept.  And I just started learning it during the degree.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:05:27):**  So I just did an online PDC, as it's called.  And it was only actually in my second year that I discovered the power of aquaponics,  using the fish to produce the nutrients for the plants and then the plants to clean the  
**[0:05:45-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:05:45):**  water to then go back into the fish system.  So I think it was that combination of permaculture and aquaponics in the sort of end of my second  year that led me to think about aquaculture in a very different manner.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:06:04):**  And it was just so much more interesting than some of the modules at uni.  Just because it was circular, it had, everything had a purpose, everything had a design element  to it.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:06:20):**  And that's what really changed the shape of my degree.  I was actually going to go and study bluefin tuna aquaculture in the very early days of  my degree.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:06:30):**  And then in the end, I ended up in love with the permaculture and aquaponics side of things.  Sure, yeah, I can imagine.  And syntropic, when did that enter the journey?  
**[0:06:41-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:06:41):**  Well, to answer your question, I mean, I was born in Kenya, and I only spent a couple of  years abroad during my degree and really wanted to come back to Kenya.  And so I just became an entrepreneur out of university.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:06:55):**  But the syntropic, I mean, I suppose in permaculture, there's quite a lot on food forests, which  I always thought was quite interesting.  And so when I had a previous company of mine together with a best friend, we did actually  
**[0:07:09-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:07:09):**  set up quite a lot of food forests in different areas on different scales for different clients.  But it was really when we moved to the desert, we got a big contract for an oil company to  set up farms in the desert, community farms.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:07:22):**  And that's really where the journey started.  And of course, watching a lot of YouTube movies, trying to decipher a lot of Portuguese literature  from Brazil.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:07:31):**  And it was only really when I went to Brazil for the first time in 2018, to go and visit  some of these amazing projects that we'd watched online, that I really started to understand  it a lot better.  
**[0:07:43-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:07:43):**  And I've been lucky since then to be quite connected with a couple of the early students  of Ernst Gotch and some of his colleagues.  So I suppose that really gave me the proper insight into how these complex systems work.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:08:05):**  And then of course, the drive to bring them back home.  I wouldn't say we're by any means the only ones doing centropic agroforestry in East  Africa, but we certainly seem to be the only ones trying to push it on a commercial level  
**[0:08:19-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:08:19):**  and spread it across all the agroecological zones.  So I think we can take so many amazing examples from Brazil, but we still need to remember  that there's a huge amount of work to do here in East Africa to actually incorporate a lot  
**[0:08:35-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:08:35):**  of the native species as well.  Yeah, so how do you quote unquote translate that to the local context, which is of course  East Africa?  
**[0:08:47-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:08:47):**  Like how do you take that, what works really, really well in Brazil?  And we've actually featured Felipe Passini on the podcast who's trying to apply that  in Portugal, actually successfully in Portugal and Spain and now in Italy.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:09:01):**  And so how do you bring that to another context like Kenya and what is needed to translate  that into something that makes sense in a local context?  How complex or complicated is that?  
**[0:09:12-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:09:12):**  Well I think what's so beautiful about the Brazilian models, and actually I owe that  to one of my business partners, Marcos.  He's been in Kenya for 25 years and if you take the map of Brazil and you put it over  
**[0:09:30-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:09:30):**  the African map, you'll find that there's a huge amount of similarity with Central Africa,  East Africa and parts of Southern Africa.  And so without reinventing, yeah that helps a lot because without reinventing the wheel  
**[0:09:44-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:09:44):**  we can take a lot of their models, their successful models, be it in the agriculture sector, be  it in the livestock sector, be it in the forestry sector and localize them to fit into the East  African or African context.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:09:59):**  So a lot of their climates, a lot of their biomes, a lot of their soils are not too dissimilar  from Africa and so by tweaking what they've already been doing very successfully for 40,  50 years, we don't need to reinvent the wheel and start from zero.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:10:19):**  Whereas I think a lot of the temperate, centropic models that are being developed at the moment  in the temperate regions, of course the fundamentals are of course the same, but that tweaking  I would say is a lot more severe than doing it here in Africa.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:10:35):**  So if you had to, of course I'll put some links below, but if you had to describe, which  for sure you've done a gazillion times by now, centropic agroforestry to or centropic  agriculture in general to someone who's new to it but interested, how do you start or  
**[0:10:51-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:10:51):**  how do you describe it?  Just for people that are listening and that haven't heard it somewhere but don't really  know what it means specifically, what is your go-to intro?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:11:00):**  Yeah, I mean I think we need to respect that term a lot and I think someone like Ernst  Gotch, the godfather of it all, would frown upon many people using that term incorrectly  but I think without trying to fully incorporate his definition, I would say from the way I've  
**[0:11:21-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:11:21):**  always seen it really is to use the fundamentals and the dynamics of forests and forest models  and translate those into the landscape because every landscape, no matter which part of succession  it's in, has the ability to become forested or to become a paradise in terms of plants,  
**[0:11:49-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:11:49):**  even in desert and dry land environments.  So I would say it's really using the fundamentals of the forest to create and drive production.  I know that the…  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:12:03):**  And that word succession seems to be key as well, right?  Absolutely, absolutely.  It's not a static…  
**[0:12:08-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:12:08):**  No, absolutely, it's an ever-changing dynamic production system and I don't think there's  one exact answer, there's fundamentals that can be followed but there's no exact recipe  like each place has its own recipe and at the end of the day, the people in charge of  
**[0:12:27-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:12:27):**  that piece of land or the project are ultimately in charge of what the design looks like in  the end.  So as long as the fundamentals are followed, then the end result can be beautifully different  
**[0:12:40-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:12:40):**  depending on what you want.  And I think Africa is the place for it really.  And so what is your recipe for forest foods?  
**[0:12:48-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:12:48):**  Yeah, it's a good question.  In these early phases, we find it very important to not only be the pioneers of bringing commercial  syntropic systems here but I think through our brand of premium produce, I think initially  
**[0:13:07-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:13:07):**  it's very important.  So obviously creating very high-end food, be it both fresh and in the near future value  added.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:13:16):**  And I think there's no limitation to what we can do in the medium to long term because  we've obviously got the incorporation of all sorts of amazing timber varieties that are  found across this continent as well as a lot of fruit, nuts, botanical species and ultimately,  
**[0:13:39-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:13:39):**  how amazing would it be if we could also do most of the arable crops in a syntropic manner.  So everything from your daily staples like mace is a really big one here in Kenya, a  lot of bean varieties, sorghum, millet, cassava not so much but sweet potato is quite big  
**[0:13:58-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:13:58):**  as well.  So it would be just incredible to be able to do this across different agroecological  zones on scale as well using small to medium acreages but lots of them and being able to  
**[0:14:10-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:14:10):**  produce even staple crops like this, I think that's really where the vision is.  And then of course livestock too, I mean there's no need to end it at plants.  So just walk us through it.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:14:23):**  I mean walk us through an example of how mace for instance would look like or how mace looks  like now in the predominant, let's say local system or the predominant system you see and  how would it look like in a syntropic one.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:14:38):**  Keeping in mind obviously that we're in a podcast so you have to talk visually and describe  it if people close their eyes now or what bring them to a before and after or a comparison  one.  
**[0:14:48-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:14:48):**  Sure, sure.  I mean I think I need to start with you know I'm 35 years old now and obviously quite a  lot has changed in this country since I was a little fellow but I think one of the most  
**[0:15:02-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:15:02):**  evident changes is that you know lots of farming societies across the country have kind of  lost their historical polyculture approach.  I'm not saying it's lost completely, not at all, don't get me wrong and I'm really not  
**[0:15:21-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:15:21):**  trying to generalize here but you see more and more acreages going into, they might not  be only monocultures, it could be maize and a bean variety for an example but you see  more and more maize on maize on maize you know very few rotations, lots of ploughing  
**[0:15:41-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:15:41):**  and I think there's certainly parts of Kenya that produce really good maize and I suppose  they're just a bit more skilled or a bit more climatically lucky than some of the other  areas in the country but I think you're seeing more and more landscapes going into a single  
**[0:16:03-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:16:03):**  crop and I think from a succession perspective you're always going to run into problems if  you remain only in or if you try and drive your field to stay in one part of succession  right because obviously maize falls into that early to mid grass stage of succession and  
**[0:16:23-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:16:23):**  if you're constantly trying to keep in that stage you're always going to end up fighting  nature's way of moving succession forwards right and so I think historically across the  continent there was a lot more polyculture and a lot more clever polycultural systems  
**[0:16:45-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:16:45):**  that allowed for longer term crops and longer term presence on the same piece of land but  that seems to be disappearing that and I don't know if it's the knowledge of polyculture  is disappearing or just people are becoming a bit lazier with their farming strategies  
**[0:17:05-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:17:05):**  but that's certainly something I see more and more of as you drive across the country  and there's obviously also a hell of a lot less forest cover I think we're down to about  five to seven percent forest cover depending on what literature you read and that's just  
**[0:17:24-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:17:24):**  simply not enough.  And now let's take us to an ideal system with my maize included because I think many people  think of syndromic agroforestry rightfully so as agroforestry so a lot of trees, tree  
**[0:17:38-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:17:38):**  crops but don't really know unless they have done a deep dive into YouTube or have been  to Brazil don't really know how annuals and how these grasses because at the end that's  what we're talking about here can be incorporated into a syndromic agroforestry system so now  
**[0:17:54-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:17:54):**  take us to an ideal one that you would already have designed and has been running or something  you would design and how does it look and feel and smell and sound for all of us that  are stuck in the city and can't even imagine that so take us on an audio journey to a syndromic  
**[0:18:10-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:18:10):**  agroforestry system with annuals actually included.  Yeah sure no problem yeah I mean I think myself personally I haven't grown as much maize as  some of my Brazilian partners and colleagues but if I'm to describe what it would look  
**[0:18:25-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:18:25):**  like there's obviously lots of different recipes for these systems and so you've got to take  sun orientation into mind right and so I think if people were keen to grow certain cereal  crops or early to mid grasses for as long as possible then obviously your tree lines  
**[0:18:46-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:18:46):**  would be wider apart than if you're trying to create shade quite quickly you'd also have  to orientate them east-west to maximize as much sunshine that's on the equator anyway  where we are but I think the beauty with growing maize which is really actually a placenta  
**[0:19:02-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:19:02):**  crop really and it can be grown with so many other things because it's actually an emergent  so if you look at its stratification.  So I have to ask you what is a placenta crop just to just to frame it for the audience  
**[0:19:18-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:19:18):**  that's not a syndromic and terminology expert.  Yeah great well I mean placenta really refers to like it does in a mammal you know it's  where everything starts it's where I suppose babies are nurtured and so I think in the  
**[0:19:34-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:19:34):**  early phases of agroforestry systems there's certain placenta crops that are grown to maximize  photosynthesis to open up the ground and so like cassava is one of the kings for an example  but cassava and maize can also grow very well together because they have different stratification  
**[0:19:51-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:19:51):**  A and they have different time frames of how long they're in the ground for right and so  I think for the audience to imagine what a really nice syndromic maize field would look  like is you know you could potentially consider the three sisters you know like a ground cover  
**[0:20:12-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:20:12):**  like pumpkin a climber like a bean and then maize in the middle for an example if you  wanted to really take it to simplicity with tree lines and as long as those tree lines  don't provide too much shade you can continue growing these crops in those combinations  
**[0:20:33-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:20:33):**  until the land is ready to receive a perennial crop for an example so I don't know if I'm  doing a good job there in trying to make that visual for the for the audience but I think  the three sisters is a great little example of how how simplistic and these systems can  
**[0:20:55-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:20:55):**  look like on scale as well and you know three annual crops grown together  Yeah because that's I think a good point as well on the scale on the scale piece which  many and the three sisters I'll put a link below I think it's a very famous but if you  
**[0:21:11-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:21:11):**  haven't dive deep into it example I think from from Central America originally like  how to yeah have three annuals which which of course is not ideal but incredibly incredibly  abundant if you do that well together but on the scale piece because always people are  
**[0:21:29-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:21:29):**  like oh yeah the first tree is great food forest, asymptotic, blah blah blah blah blah  but I would never scale it's always nice on a few hectares a few acres and things like  that but I know many people are and we're going to do for sure some interviews on it  
**[0:21:41-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:21:41):**  on how to like what's the role of machinery and automation and what's what is the strategy  to scale but if you would have to summarize it because of course you you have to when  you talk to investors like okay how does this go from a few hectares here and there to an  
**[0:21:56-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:21:56):**  agriculture system or a production system that is scalable like how do you reply to  the scale a question which you must get all the time  Yeah no great so that's a wonderful question and we get asked we get asked that all the  
**[0:22:12-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:22:12):**  time I think my probably a better way to answer it is that there's constantly new machinery  and technology being developed for the larger scale agroforestry systems I would also like  to you know to bring up that in places like France they've also got quite serious I mean  
**[0:22:39-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:22:39):**  they're not as complex perhaps as some of the tropical asymptotic systems but you know  they've got some very successful arable agroforestry systems that have I don't know 15-20 years  old and so that's just a matter of bringing in your planting equipment and your harvesting  
**[0:22:58-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:22:58):**  equipment and making sure your tree lines can can handle that and in some other cases  some of your spraying equipment and I think in the context of scaling this across much  larger landscapes I think there's plenty of good examples in in Brazil as well and just  
**[0:23:17-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:23:17):**  off what I visited in some of the states in Brazil some of the work in Brappa has been  doing which is their research facility for agriculture and forestry they've got I think  over 225 million hectares of I suppose restored rangelands that were once heavily degraded  
**[0:23:40-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:23:40):**  and probably overgrazed but simply with four or five species you quite often see you know  hundreds if not thousands of hectares with the what they call the integrated forestry  and livestock system which has lines of eucalyptus and generally brokaria underneath and then  
**[0:24:02-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:24:02):**  livestock grazing in the shade in them but before the brokaria grass or before the panicum  or one of the tropical fodder grasses was added you would have had rotations of soya  and maize and just that right now those systems are being marketed as carbon neutral systems  
**[0:24:22-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:24:22):**  because the livestock all the methane and all the the gases that the livestock are producing  are combated by the or neutralized rather by the combination of trees and pasture and  I think to be able to do that in a place like Brazil over like I say I think the figure  
**[0:24:39-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:24:39):**  is 225 million hectares is just shows you what the potential is if we if we wanted to  scale these types of agroforestry systems even here in Africa.  And so are you saying with scale you lose a certain level of complexity?  
**[0:24:57-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:24:57):**  Well I think most people on scale want to simplify the process right and so I think  that's one of the beautiful aspects of the Centropic model is that you can go as complex  as you want on a small to medium scale but then maybe when you when you're doing it across  
**[0:25:14-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:25:14):**  thousands of hectares you'd want to simplify it a little bit right just so that the machinery  required wouldn't need to be too advanced because obviously you're harvesting and you're  planting equipment and mostly needs to be taken into consideration.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:25:30):**  But that's not to say that you can't make it as complex.  And are you in that camp or are you yeah are you in the camp or are you saying we should  like it loses too much if we make it less complex thus we need to create the conditions  
**[0:25:46-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:25:46):**  or the context that we can do this at scale with the complexity biodiversity nature soil  needs and want?  No I'm totally for I'm totally in the camp of doing it on a large scale with complexity  
**[0:26:01-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:26:01):**  because if you look at what I just described in Brazil you know the the the pasture grass  that was planted after four or five rotations with soya and maize for an example and only  eucalyptus I mean we can go so much further than that like eucalyptus is is a emergent  
**[0:26:19-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:26:19):**  it has an emergent stratification and so there would be so many more species that we could  integrate into that model already and make it a bit more complex just based on stratification  because really with those eucalyptus systems we've got a nice ground cover and we've got  
**[0:26:36-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:26:36):**  an emergent but we're missing all the other layers in between there.  What I'm trying to say is if they're able to do it already now in Brazil on that scale  then it's just a matter of tweaking the recipe and getting in those different stratification  
**[0:26:51-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:26:51):**  and different layers to be able to produce much more food, fiber, fruit and timber even  you know so.  And how easy is it to like integrate to complexify after you already started the system like  
**[0:27:08-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:27:08):**  like like these systems are on millions of hectares and are four or five species way  more complex than your normal soil corn rotation and way more complex than only livestock obviously  but not nearly as complex as could be like is it are you then relatively path dependent  
**[0:27:27-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:27:27):**  and you're stuck or is it relatively easy okay we we put a base layer where 20% or 10  or whatever and now we're gonna tweak and add and cut and like complexify over time  is that a doable strategy or do you need to do that from the beginning?  
**[0:27:41-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:27:41):**  Yeah yeah I mean it's a great question and I've made I've burnt my fingers quite a lot  in the past by trying to introduce new seedlings in a system that's already a couple of years  old and I think the nicest analogy is of football actually if you try and take a small child  
**[0:28:02-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:28:02):**  and get him to play with a professional football player they're in a very different class you  know in a very different league and so what I've learned is that the best way to do all  this is when you plant things together and that's why planning these systems is so important  
**[0:28:20-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:28:20):**  and using past experience and past research is so important and I'm not saying it's impossible  I think you could quite comfortably get rid of a whole bunch of eucalyptus and replant  different species but you do need to realize then you're going back to in many ways the  
**[0:28:41-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:28:41):**  early stages of succession and so you probably need again to introduce some placenta species  to be able to get that those tree strips ready for a native variety for an example and I  think this is where the conversation of using natives and non-natives is so important because  
**[0:29:01-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:29:01):**  there's so many people who are against natives or again I mean sorry non-natives and you  know I think they get such a bad rep but we need to remember that there's like every landscape's  in a different position and if I think so many tree planting initiatives fail all across  
**[0:29:20-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:29:20):**  the world because there's a big heavy focus on planting native species but if the landscape's  not ready to receive those native species then they're never going to survive or they're  never going to thrive they might they may survive but they'll never thrive and so I  
**[0:29:34-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:29:34):**  think this is where we need to stop criticizing species based on where they come from and  start figuring out how to work with them as a combination right because a lot of the time  the non-native ones will support the native ones until the native ones are ready to thrive  
**[0:29:57-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:29:57):**  and at that point you get rid of them so back to your initial question is it too late to  change things once you've already got your plantations up and running in a lot of ways  it's it's much easier to just start with that diversity in the beginning but it's got to  
**[0:30:13-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:30:13):**  be planned very well in terms of space and time and that's not that complicated you know  you need people who have some experience with forestry and you need people with experience  in planning and putting together projects to make that a reality and I don't think finding  
**[0:30:28-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:30:28):**  that combination is impossible it really isn't yeah but it's it is I mean it it doesn't sound  too complicated but at the same time it's such a paradigm shift even in forestry to  think in layers and even in forestry to think in time and in agriculture of course completely  
**[0:30:47-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:30:47):**  to to think in the different stages and succession and layers that it might not be too too difficult  but it's my it seems to be quite far away from from the current status quo in many places  so that maybe makes the jump so difficult and what do you say I mean we're gonna get  
**[0:31:05-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:31:05):**  to forest foods in a second but what would you say to to investors that are interested  or people that are in the financial sector that are tasked with putting money to work  where would you say like in in the succession or in the phases where is in Tropicago forestry  
**[0:31:22-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:31:22):**  you would say maybe globally but also definitely regionally where you are in terms of succession  etc where where are we are we ready for for big investments are we still in the placenta  stage and what where where do we find ourselves now we're talking at the end of 2022.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:31:38):**  No that's a great question Kun and I appreciate that but I think what's become radically clear  is that the conventional system has and continues to fail us I mean I won't get into what I  think the history of sort of pre-colonial farming is on you know in South America in  
**[0:31:56-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:31:56):**  Africa but I think the conventional systems just continue failing us and so anyone who  wants to invest in tomorrow needs to understand that there's other models out there and that  there's better models out there when it comes to the whole region question I think it's  
**[0:32:12-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:32:12):**  a bit different than the centropic question just because you know the oldest centropic  systems to date are nearly 40 years old some of them actually maybe a little bit older  and so we're no longer in the trial phase like there are thousands of consortias or  
**[0:32:29-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:32:29):**  combinations rather that have been developed in South America that just need a little bit  of tweaking to fit the African context so I would say investment like I would say centropic  agroforestry is definitely investment ready and we of course here with what we're doing.  
**[0:32:50-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:32:50):**  So we're in this scale up and implementation space like it's no longer tweaking the solar  panel to take the renewable energy analogy but it's now okay how do we develop large  enough scale projects make it bankable and investable and put it on a lot of roofs.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:33:07):**  Absolutely and I think this is you know time to also mention that I think the profitability  per acre you know we need to we need to really focus on that and when we talk about the layers  and in space and time and the ability for the centropic model to be you know 220 efficient  
**[0:33:32-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:33:32):**  I mean that that's really the bottom line is you know how can we be as profitable but  also as productive and as biodiverse as possible on a per acre basis and any of these models  that beat the current conventional model should be considered as key things to invest in when  
**[0:33:50-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:33:50):**  it comes to food systems I think.  And so what I mean bringing a question forward that I sometimes ask a bit later on but if  you had a billion dollars or euros what would you invest in obviously without giving investment  
**[0:34:02-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:34:02):**  advice and I'm not asking for a dollar amount but I'm asking what would you prioritize of  course you might prioritize your own company but maybe you put it in machinery or maybe  in software or what would you do if you had quote unquote almost unlimited resources.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:34:17):**  Yeah no that's a great question and I actually I'm gonna I'm gonna keep it Africa centric  for now I think this continent has and should be a powerhouse in terms of producing food  fiber and timber, medicinals you name it but that's from a terrestrial perspective right.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:34:35):**  What about the entire African coastline and all the inland freshwater habitats so I mean  I think if I had a billion dollars I would split it equally into terrestrial and aquatic  systems and a lot of Africa is untapped and you know we've got 365 days of sunshine a  
**[0:34:55-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:34:55):**  huge amount of natural resources so I would yeah I would turn it into large-scale and  agroforestry systems and then of course to try and do a very similar thing in the water  yeah both marine and freshwater.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:35:11):**  And what would be your approach like would you buy a lot of land or a lot of leases for  for coastal areas or would you focus on the consumer side of things or what would you  what would your structure be or your approach be to develop these large-scale agroforestry  
**[0:35:30-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:35:30):**  systems?  Yeah no great question I think I would probably take a similar approach to what we're doing  currently with forest foods in that we there's a huge amount of idle land or unproductive  
**[0:35:42-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:35:42):**  land across the continent huge and so whether it's a matter of purchase or I don't think  owning outright you know massive tracts of land is the way forward I think there's a  huge amount of community engagement that needs to happen there's a huge amount of capacity  
**[0:36:04-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:36:04):**  building like you know training hundreds of thousands if not millions of people under  the age of 35 to create careers in this because you know I think that's the beauty when you  compare agroforestry this style anyway to other forms of farming is this really allows  
**[0:36:22-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:36:22):**  for a career path because there's so you know an agroforestry system is so complex and can  last so many years that you're actually you never stop learning and so you know that capacity  building from I think setting up really top-end schools for both the private sector and the  
**[0:36:42-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:36:42):**  public sector would be key in capacity building and creating literally hundreds of thousands  of experts across the continent we have so many different biomes in Africa that anything  is possible but I think that doing it through people the education of the people from a  
**[0:37:03-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:37:03):**  production side is the most important thing and then from a consumer perspective obviously  mass education in guys how can we create nutrient-dense food systems and why is that so important I  think another massive change since I was born in Kenya anyways that there's a lot more new  
**[0:37:26-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:37:26):**  diseases and ailments hitting the local populations that were never there before and then you  ask yourself okay well what's the reason for that and I mean again I'm not gonna try and  pretend that I've really dive deep into the science behind it but is it because there's  
**[0:37:44-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:37:44):**  a lot more chemicals in people's diets is it because there's a lot more kind of fast  food in people's diets nowadays but all those things in combination are good reasons why  you know from a consumer perspective there needs to be that engagement in the educational  
**[0:38:03-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:38:03):**  aspect of why these food systems can be so much better than what's currently on offer  in the market.  And so let's unpack your current work I'm sorry we take away the 1 billion for now but  
**[0:38:16-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:38:16):**  let's unpack first foods a bit and what you're building at the moment and what you're of  course planning to build in the near future.  Yeah sure go ahead I mean because I could talk for hours and days about it so maybe  
**[0:38:32-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:38:32):**  a specific question.  Yes sure so forest foods comes out of experience you already had and have and why is it such  a logical next step in let's say your entrepreneurial path I was gonna say career but it sounds  
**[0:38:47-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:38:47):**  a bit wrong.  Sure no great I think there's three main points that all of us in the team share and about  why we think this is such an important business to be setting up right now and I think one  
**[0:39:05-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:39:05):**  of them is you know obviously profitable reforestation I think Africa's had a lot of philanthropic  money thrown at it and a lot of sort of grant and NGO money thrown at it but like unless  reforestation is profitable it's not gonna happen and it's so important that a continent  
**[0:39:26-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:39:26):**  like Africa that's gonna be the next boom has a prosperous environment right you can't  create prosperous nations if the environment isn't there and so one of the main reasons  is create profitable reforestation modules that can be rolled out across different biomes  
**[0:39:48-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:39:48):**  that's number one.  Number two really is making small and medium acreages shine again because you know that's  the other thing is it's still very much the case that you know over 70% of the food produced  
**[0:40:06-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:40:06):**  in this continent comes from small and medium acreages and so how can we make those shine  again because I personally don't think the small holder has much of a future if they  are not mechanized and if their production systems don't improve and if they don't have  
**[0:40:23-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:40:23):**  access to a thriving market and I think lastly the extremely messy fragmented supply chain  that's currently devastating a lot of the smaller scale farms is a real big problem  and that's something that needs to change but on top of that really where can consumers  
**[0:40:55-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:40:55):**  get consistency, traceability, transparency that just doesn't really exist and if it is  traceable and somewhat transparent then it's all being exported to the European supermarkets  or to the UAE and stuff so where is Africa's food security if we can't look after and make  
**[0:41:20-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:41:20):**  our own small to medium acreage shine again because still the vast majority of the food  on this continent is produced on those scale farms so what can we do to improve that.  Okay and so what can we do?  
**[0:41:39-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:41:39):**  Well we can improve the vitality of them number one and that's by changing what's produced  so like I said you know in the last I don't know 20-30 years it becomes more and more  evident when you drive around the country that just number one acreages are being split  
**[0:41:57-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:41:57):**  into smaller acreages because when it goes from one generation to the next inevitably  you know what was once maybe a thriving 20 acre farm 15-20 years ago is now being split  into 20 one acre parcels and it's a lot harder to make one acre shine with one or two crops  
**[0:42:18-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:42:18):**  or to have the ability to invest in making an acre work in terms of capex versus something  that might have been 10 times the size 15-20 years ago so what are we going to do about  these acreages to make them productive again and personally I think the rest of the team  
**[0:42:42-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:42:42):**  agrees fully well that you know the Centropic model is certainly one fantastic solution  I'm not saying it's the only one but it's certainly a fantastic solution and I also  think there's no point for a farmer to be growing the same crop for 20 years you know  
**[0:42:59-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:42:59):**  at least with these systems the work gets easier and you know the profits really do  improve in time and I think the more models we can because you see the unique thing in  Africa too is that a lot of people look over their neighbour's fence like if the neighbour  
**[0:43:20-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:43:20):**  is growing tomatoes really well hey let's do tomatoes too and then suddenly everyone  grows tomatoes and the market's flooded and you know people are no longer as profitable  or disease comes and wipes out everything so by building in this resilience and creating  
**[0:43:37-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:43:37):**  models that the neighbours will want to copy and get involved in is one way of creating  a domino effect you know.  And so now we're talking the end of 2022 which is still weird to say honestly but where are  
**[0:43:54-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:43:54):**  where is forest foods and now how would you describe it I'm not saying elevator pitch  because we're not an elevator but in a couple of minutes where what is on the ground where  are you selling what are you growing and mainly how etc and then we'll talk about the near  
**[0:44:09-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:44:09):**  future.  Yeah no great question so we've got two models for the high altitude zones of Kenya where  actually most of the farming is being done and we've got a model at 2400 meters above  
**[0:44:24-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:44:24):**  sea level and we've got another one at 2200 and we're about to start a third farm at 1600  meters so I say this because those are very important altitudes for Kenya because that's  where the vast majority of agriculture is currently happening whether it's arable whether  
**[0:44:45-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:44:45):**  it's coffee whether it's vegetables whether it's cereal crops so to have models in those  agro-ecological zones that we can then go and teach is extremely important that's where  we're at now and you know having three fully functional farms up and running and as we  
**[0:45:05-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:45:05):**  enter 2023 is I think is a really good milestone I think the second phase and perhaps the sort  of series A round can become a lot more interesting because we can go to the semi arid areas of  Kenya which are fast Kenya is covered by 65% semi arid land as a minimum we can also go  
**[0:45:30-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:45:30):**  to the coastal regions which I think is even more interesting because there's very little  agriculture there and whatever is there I mean it's really an industry that needs to  be brought to life again and then of course there's everything in between so I think having  
**[0:45:51-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:45:51):**  these what we refer to as our own nucleus farms in these different agro-ecological zones  and starting to do the training where we offer people you know two year minimum contracts  with us before we sort of allow them to go and set up their own farms on our behalf and  
**[0:46:13-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:46:13):**  become out growers for us I think is the key next step to trying to build capacity and  to create these models for the rest of the country before we start rolling them out on  scale so I would say in a nutshell that's where we're at we're definitely selling into  
**[0:46:28-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:46:28):**  a premium market mostly in Nairobi the capital city but with time and scale we should be  able to penetrate different market segments and look into value addition as well I think  that's going to be a key part to our success as well.  
**[0:46:46-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:46:46):**  And what are the crops you sell at the moment just to give people an idea what comes out  of these two and soon to be three farms?  Yeah sure so I mean at high altitude unfortunately you can't grow most of the warmer loving crops  
**[0:47:04-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:47:04):**  you know most of your solanaceae and stuff so a lot of this you know a lot of salad varieties  a lot of sorry lettuce varieties and some really niche crops like blueberries and avocados  as well there's a bit more long term crops but anything that goes into a sort of average  
**[0:47:20-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:47:20):**  weekly shopping basket is what we're growing really successfully at altitude and then the  next farm will be able to integrate a lot more of the warmer climate crops so maize,  beans, pumpkins, tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, aubergine, capsicums and start playing around  
**[0:47:38-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:47:38):**  a bit more with some of the cereal crops which do well at altitude but I think you know we  need we need more scale at altitude to be able to to grow more staple crops right now  our farms are a little bit too small to grow them at scale.  
**[0:47:53-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:47:53):**  And you mentioned you sell them to Nairobi does it mean you go to the market or how do  you make sure you capture that premium or so reach the consumer and of course bring  that premium back to or the margin back to the farm?  
**[0:48:10-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:48:10):**  Yeah 100% so we very much believe in doing direct sales with our customer base we sell  into a couple of online retailers at the moment as well as chefs and restaurants our aim is  to be in quite a few schools as well in the not so distant future and yeah we're kind  
**[0:48:32-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:48:32):**  of focusing on impact retailers at the moment people who really care what they're selling  and selling a story as well that's got nothing to do with saying that we will remain in that  premium class forever obviously with scale we can infiltrate the middle class in Kenya  
**[0:48:52-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:48:52):**  which is by far the fastest growing sector I would say of the demographic and that's  of course our longer term target market but we need a bit more scale to be able to penetrate  that market.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:49:11):**  And in terms of accessibility I mean we talk a lot about nutrient density on this podcast  but also always with or try to always take the angle okay where can it have the biggest  impact which is definitely where people eat let's say the worst quality food at the moment  
**[0:49:28-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:49:28):**  or have access to only that which is food deserts in the US or many other places which  is probably people with with certain medical conditions etc how do you see that because  going into the middle class is amazing but probably in many cases they can already afford  
**[0:49:43-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:49:43):**  or at least they have access to okay let's say food of course not the nutrient density  you would like but is there any thought or plan is where let's say to get nutrient density  food into the hands of where it matters most and if so what is your approach I completely  
**[0:50:00-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:50:00):**  understand you have two farms small at the moment it's not something that is easily it's  easier said than done but what are your thoughts there?  Yeah no 100% Kun I think that's a very valid point I think from a you know we're a private  
**[0:50:15-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:50:15):**  business a startup it's there's nothing to say that we can't venture into you know when  we scale create an SPV or maybe perhaps even a nonprofit arm or even set up a you know  secondary business that looks only into processing for an example right because there's very  
**[0:50:34-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:50:34):**  many clever innovative ways of preserving nutrient in foods nowadays and value adding  it right just so that the shelf life is better and that you're not running around with huge  volumes of very perishable produce right so I think that's a two you know I can answer  
**[0:50:57-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:50:57):**  that in two ways number one I think with scale and as soon as we enter our second phase where  we will be working with other landowners as well as organized groups of smallholders and  communities there's definitely going to be you know an impact straight away there with  
**[0:51:18-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:51:18):**  penetrating the average market right the market that the average person has access to but  then there's also the ability to be able to have multiple grades of produce right and  nutrient density is not going to change from a grade A to a grade C leafy green for an  
**[0:51:38-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:51:38):**  example the nutrient is still there it's just how it's presented and how it's  which you might sell to a restaurant but yeah the quality inside doesn't change how it looks  from the outside and like Kenya's just getting into this into this movement of you know supporting  
**[0:52:00-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:52:00):**  discard like oddly sort of the rescue the rescue side of things you know and I think  that's like I say as Kenya is such a dynamic place and it's changing so quickly and the  middle class is also changing or growing so fast rather that I think there's going to  
**[0:52:18-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:52:18):**  be enormous potential in having all sorts of crops grown like this at scale but then  entering marketplaces where you're not earning a premium for them but you've got scale on  your side right and so it becomes a volume game rather than a than a price point game  
**[0:52:37-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:52:37):**  so our goal is never to be more expensive than anything that's considered organic here  our goal is actually to come below the organic price and but when I say we're not you know  keen on selling to supermarkets and stuff it's because we're we're quite keen to keep  
**[0:52:56-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:52:56):**  the vast majority of that margin within the direct control of either our farms or the  farms we're working with what's the community angle here you mentioned it a few times and  outgrowers you've mentioned in the current phase and what is the future model look like  
**[0:53:14-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:53:14):**  in the ideal phase which I'm imagining is not going to go towards a colonial owning  every owning half of Kenya and employing a lot of people under very very bad circumstances  yeah sure no no absolutely absolute great question so I think there's a again it's it's  
**[0:53:35-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:53:35):**  kind of two-sided in in that there's a lot of people living in the urban cities that  have land in their ancestral home areas right and these people range from lawyers and doctors  all the way to I don't know anything that fits into that sort of middle class bracket  
**[0:54:03-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:54:03):**  but they're not really doing anything with their land or it's not really productive and  there's a lot of people who would like to sign in on this model I say that because most  of the time when we do our farm tours or we have visits and people are actually like wow  
**[0:54:19-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:54:19):**  we really want to to do this on our land and so I know that there's an abundance of idle  land that's sitting there and that people are willing to to improve or invest in they  just don't know what to do right so I think it's that's important to say because a lot  
**[0:54:38-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:54:38):**  of these people have either have access to the finance or already have the finance to  put together some of the capex that's required to to set up these systems right of course  you need to you need money to make money and then there's of course the community aspect  
**[0:54:54-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:54:54):**  slash the smallholder aspect and I and I bunch them into two different categories because  most of the time the smallholder won't have access to funds won't have access and to what's  required from an infrastructure perspective to get them on the right path and so I think  
**[0:55:12-0:55:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:55:12):**  clever partnerships with third parties that specialize in dealing with either the smallholders  or the cooperatives and would be our approach for that and we'd always want to make sure  we have our own strong nucleus farm and in the middle of that geographical area so that  
**[0:55:32-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:55:32):**  we can provide the required support and both from a excuse me both from an expertise perspective  but perhaps also from a capex perspective and you know we'd have cold storages on our  farms we'd have machinery and access to irrigation and little agro shops where the where the  
**[0:55:56-0:56:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:55:56):**  you know the the small others could buy some of their equipment from us from so I think  there's that approach and then there's the the landowner who wants to do something with  their idle land but just lacks the knowledge or lacks the inspiration to do something with  
**[0:56:12-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:56:12):**  it and that's how I think we're gonna  And basically for for for them you provide sort of a plug and play like I would love  this on my land as well but I live far away in Nairobi and I can't or I don't want to  
**[0:56:30-0:56:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:56:30):**  and you would lease it long term they might invest in and you would manage it basically  long term for them and sell the produce and then somehow split the the the revenue or  the profit or they might even invest in that because they have the means to do that but  
**[0:56:47-0:57:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:56:47):**  just not the means to actually do it on the ground  Correct and I must be very honest with you are a lot of works gone into some intensive  spreadsheets both from a production perspective and planning but also into a financial perspective  
**[0:57:02-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:57:02):**  and a lot of that work has gone into our own nucleus farms which are currently geared to  be upwards of four hectares and we need to have those strategically up and running in  the different parts of the country that we want to operate in first I say this because  
**[0:57:18-0:57:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:57:18):**  those farms will create our brand a very trusted brand which we're going to need our customer  base buy in for first before we start off taking or promising off take from our future  partners be them the communities be them the the landowners and so that we can guarantee  
**[0:57:41-0:57:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:57:41):**  their you know these products end up in the market so I think we're doing a little bit  opposite to what most people try  Are you going to test the quality or how do you going to secure how do you going to make  
**[0:57:55-0:58:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:57:55):**  sure the of course if it comes from your own farm you know but if it starts you start buying  from others you're going to test the nutrient density or are you going to measure I mean  I don't know Omega 3 and 6 ratio depending on like on animal protein how do you keep  
**[0:58:10-0:58:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:58:10):**  quality control and let's say as that's your your main focus of course like it has to come  from a synthetic but how's entropic system like how do you make how you're going to make  sure of course is a hypothetical question  
**[0:58:22-0:58:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:58:22):**  Yeah I mean again this is where the capacity building becomes so important and this is  where I think building an army of you know Kenyan experts who represent us either as  field scouts or who are who end up being you know senior supervisors on these outgrower  
**[0:58:39-0:59:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:58:39):**  projects that's really where I think the first point of traceability and transparency lies  I also think that with us managing them for the vast majority I would say means that you  know it has to be to our standards I think the one of the critical things moving forward  
**[0:59:01-0:59:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:59:01):**  for us and I think for the for the centropic movement globally is actually going to be  its own certification because I don't think we want to follow the organic route I think  the centropic deserves its own certification scheme and so that's one thing that I think  
**[0:59:21-0:59:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:59:21):**  will be key to develop in the future of course testing nutrient density or making that available  and affordable is going to be key and I think there's plenty of grant money out there to  hopefully help us in creating some of those requirements right I don't think we per se  
**[0:59:42-1:00:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=0:59:42):**  need to be investing in that ourselves and then I think really like what we're currently  building internally because we've tried we've tried buying software in the past but you  know unfortunately it seems it's not quite fit for our production systems but we're creating  
**[1:00:03-1:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:00:03):**  our own dashboard which allows us to enter a lot of data and production data, harvest  data, waste data, it allows us to create a digital twin of our current farms and all  the different crops and the different varieties and stuff and I think the legitimacy and the  
**[1:00:23-1:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:00:23):**  quality of this data on the eventual blockchain is going to be worth gold moving forward because  we're going to be able to prove a lot of things and having it on the blockchain I think is  going to be key to securing the legitimacy of everything we're saying we're doing right  
**[1:00:42-1:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:00:42):**  and so I think as that technology becomes more and more available to the everyday person  I think that's going to be where we're going to find ourselves spending quite a lot of  time and effort and I myself am not very well versed with blockchain but luckily some people  
**[1:01:02-1:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:01:02):**  in our team are so yeah looking forward to the value of the data we collect over the  next couple of years I think is going to be super important.  And I want to be conscious of your time as well and I'm looking forward to checking on  
**[1:01:17-1:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:01:17):**  this in the future but to end with a few questions we always like to ask what do you believe  to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't believe to be true and this  is definitely inspired by a question John Kempf asks often so where are you contrarian?  
**[1:01:33-1:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:01:33):**  Yeah and you know I think the biggest thing for me having taught myself a lot of what  I know by reading a lot of books and you know investing in a lot of books and doing courses  online both physical and online I think what I would like to see be the biggest change  
**[1:01:59-1:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:01:59):**  is that we need to start creating tropical literature for the regenerative world I think  a lot of it is tempered and so what I believe to be true versus false from your question  it really comes down to which part of the world right and so I think regenerative is  
**[1:02:16-1:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:02:16):**  a very feasible option for us I think it's one of the only options actually we've got  as a civilization moving forward so I believe in everything that it stands for but whether  all the different approaches work that's a separate question but the reason I'm talking  
**[1:02:38-1:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:02:38):**  about the temperate versus the tropical is because there's very little on tropical region  how to if you like manuals and stuff and so I think I've tried a lot of stuff that I've  read in the books and watched in the movies from temperate regions that don't necessarily  
**[1:03:01-1:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:03:01):**  fit the tropical context because we don't have a winter and we don't have a die off  and you know we have 365 days of sunshine and so a lot of what is currently being described  for the temperate regions isn't per se transferable to the tropics and so that's I think one of  
**[1:03:20-1:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:03:20):**  my biggest goals or our biggest goals with what we're doing now is to create literature  that's Africa centric right and so I think we need to prove a lot more by having partnerships  with universities and researchers and proving all this stuff on a local context before I  
**[1:03:45-1:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:03:45):**  could fully answer what do I believe is true or not about the model right because I think  a lot of the successful pioneers are operating in the in the US or Europe or Australia and  New Zealand you know so yeah I hope that answers that question.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:04:04):**  And it leads perfectly to the last one actually I can imagine the answer but I'm still gonna  ask it what if you have a magic wand you can change one thing overnight what would you  change in the region or in the agriculture and food space or wider if you want but let's  
**[1:04:23-1:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:04:23):**  keep it to agriculture and food for now if you had to change one thing and you had the  power to do it what would that be?  Sure I think for me yeah so I think the single most delicate as well as the single most fragile  
**[1:04:44-1:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:04:44):**  component in the agri and forestry space moving into the future is water I think we if I had  a magic wand I would literally unlock water because I think water will become the most  expensive input in the future it already is and countries companies organisations regions  
**[1:05:07-1:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:05:07):**  that invested in water in the last 20 30 years have done the best thing they could do I think  there's obviously you know massive concerns about the very finite resource of fresh water  we have available to us in a you know in a liquid form on this planet but I think especially  
**[1:05:32-1:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:05:32):**  in Africa with 98% of the agriculture being done in a rain fed manner and with a crazy  crazy changing climate I mean it happens every rainy season we're seeing massive changes  so I think for me unlocking water as either an opex or a capex is gonna be the most fundamental  
**[1:05:53-1:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:05:53):**  change that I would like to see happening over the next five to ten years and if we  don't do it now then it's gonna be even more and this is gonna be a whole whole different  kind of words but yeah if we don't do it now so no it's just if we don't do it now it's  
**[1:06:10-1:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:06:10):**  only gonna become more expensive and it's only gonna become more difficult in the future  if we don't start doing it now and when I say we I'm talking about as individuals as  organisations as governments as areas like we need to unlock water and it needs to happen  
**[1:06:31-1:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:06:31):**  now  when you say unlock what do you mean?  well I mean like right now I'll take our context for an example is you know nobody or not enough  
**[1:06:42-1:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:06:42):**  people are using rain and storing it for an example so I mean rain is the best form of  investing in water because it's the only renewable form you've also got obviously aquifers and  there's a lot of bor holes being drilled and you know yes in some situations water is safest  
**[1:07:02-1:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:07:02):**  underground where it's not being contaminated or being changed but water is a very expensive  infrastructure in this part of the world whether you drill for it whether you build reservoirs  to capture it from the sky or whether you abstract from you know rivers and lakes and  
**[1:07:26-1:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:07:26):**  ponds which actually isn't really allowed anymore but the reason I say unlock is because  the key to what I'm saying 98% of our of the continents agriculture still being done with  rain as in rain fed systems non-irrigated systems so when I'm talking about unlocking  
**[1:07:47-1:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:07:47):**  water I'm talking about unlocking it for the use of irrigation but of course sensible irrigation  and I think there's plenty of models that use water very irresponsibly and of course  that should never be allowed but this is why I'm such a fan of agroforestry especially  
**[1:08:08-1:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:08:08):**  the centropic way because if you use irrigation to create profitable models it's very common  to switch that off after four to five years or use it very sparingly after that because  you've built such a resilient system and so my point is let's unlock it now and make it  
**[1:08:31-1:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:08:31):**  available and make it affordable so that we can create these systems on scale and on mass  because unlike a conventional veggie patch or a conventional farm that uses irrigation  to produce the same crops for 20 years this system of ours allows you to switch it off  
**[1:08:52-1:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:08:52):**  after a while and I think that's what's so key is create these systems that inevitably  will create more water and more rainfall in the future because of their architecture and  use these resources while we still have them available to us now.  
**[1:09:11-1:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:09:11):**  Asking a potential rabbit hole question and then we're gonna wrap up but you mentioned  it very nicely at the end of the last sentence like these systems create more rainfall is  that something you're actively designing for or taking into consideration and into account  
**[1:09:27-1:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:09:27):**  like how do these systems at scale influence local or smaller water cycles and even larger  ones and bring back rains or even almost not rains and not water to literally in that case  also unlock water is that something that is part of because I know it's part of the largest  
**[1:09:48-1:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:09:48):**  in tropic agroforestry movement also the region movement and I think we need to talk about  it a lot more we're most likely going to do a series of water cycles next year to really  change the dynamic or change the conversation to we can influence rain and water cycles  
**[1:10:04-1:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:10:04):**  at quite a large scale and we need to have that discussion how to do that is that something  you're designing with or playing with or thinking about is it part of your vocabulary?  I think it really is Kun because when you I mean there's plenty of evidence of areas  
**[1:10:24-1:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:10:24):**  not per se agroforestry even reforestation or afforestation but there's plenty of data  and research that proves that you know areas with mass ground cover and in different stratification  create micro climates I mean it's a given but I think the biggest mistake is that people  
**[1:10:47-1:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:10:47):**  look at everything from an above ground perspective they ignore the below ground perspective but  what happens when you've got root systems that again like you do similar above ground  have different stratifications from a sort of canopy perspective you've got the same  
**[1:11:04-1:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:11:04):**  in the root system and so you know when you're building these pumps below and above ground  it's a no brainer that you're creating I mean you're influencing the hydrological cycle  so not only are we using this precious amazing water that we should be accessing now to create  
**[1:11:22-1:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:11:22):**  and plant these systems eventually they're going to do it for themselves.  I quite often like to use an example of you know what are the daily requirements per hectare  of a flower farm or a conventional veggie patch or a center pivot versus our usage I  
**[1:11:43-1:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:11:43):**  mean let's take flower farming that on average in this part of the world uses 50,000 liters  per hectare per day rain or shine because most of it's done in greenhouses and let's  convert how much acreage we could set up with that same amount of water.  
**[1:12:02-1:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:12:02):**  Kickstart.  You know I think the answer is obvious.  And just out of like what is the ratio there it's like 1 to 50, 1 to 100, 1 to 5 because  
**[1:12:15-1:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:12:15):**  you needed a number of years but then you don't need it anymore or depends a bit on  the crop of course like just in terms of scale of course I don't need an exact number but  just to give us an idea.  
**[1:12:24-1:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:12:24):**  I think a lot of it depends on the rainfall if you're me personally from everything I've  seen and everything I've experienced if you are in an area of rainfall of less than a  thousand mils a year then you probably need irrigation for the first five years you could  
**[1:12:38-1:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:12:38):**  probably get away with cutting it out at three years depending on what crops you've chosen  to focus on but then in areas where there's only between 300 and 700 mils I think you  might have to tickle irrigate for the years five, six, seven and eight until really you've  
**[1:12:59-1:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:12:59):**  got enough humus and enough fungal dominance in your soils to be able to know quite safely  that you've got the water capacity in your soils and in your above ground biomass.  So I would say it all depends on you know if you're above a thousand mils you're in  
**[1:13:18-1:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:13:18):**  a different category if you're below a thousand mils but again with all the rainfall being  so different nowadays you know you might get 500 mils of rain falling in three days and  then any landscape is going to get severely hampered by that because the vast majority  
**[1:13:35-1:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:13:35):**  of that water is not going to infiltrate into your soils you know so I think it really depends  on the natural hydrological cycle and but I would say give it an average of five years  and you can switch off most of your irrigation forever.  
**[1:13:52-1:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:13:52):**  And which means that that 50,000 I think you said gallons of per day what would it get  you like how many instead of a patch of flowers which you can honestly also argue do we need  that but that's a different discussion.  
**[1:14:06-1:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:14:06):**  In terms of agroforestry farms like how many hectares would it get to you like in a in  a three to seven hundred mil is that 20 hectares or 50 and in a thousand mil like the ideal  situation just to give us an idea of the potential here.  
**[1:14:21-1:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:14:21):**  Sure sure so I think just off my last four years experience up here and I would say that  a you know 50 cubic meters which is currently used on the flower farms per hectare we could  probably do between two and four hectares with that same amount of water quite comfortably  
**[1:14:40-1:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:14:40):**  depending on the crop we're focusing on or the crops we're focusing on.  And then after a couple of years you can do another two to four and like this is a renewable  source if you do it well and it just should get easier over time it's using the solar  
**[1:14:56-1:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:14:56):**  panels to make more solar panels.  Exactly exactly but I mean everything depends on the initial quality of that irrigation  water too you know.  
**[1:15:03-1:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:15:03):**  Of course of course.  The problem we have here is there's a lot of salts in the in the boreholes so that's  why rain is by far the best fertilizer on the planet is rainfall.  
**[1:15:15-1:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:15:15):**  Perfect I want to thank you so much for your time we went quite deep and diverse and hit  some very very important points and I want to want to thank you for sharing of course  for the work you do to really kickstart a new African agriculture renaissance and to  
**[1:15:34-1:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:15:34):**  make sure it is let's say future proof.  Koon likewise thank you for having us.  I really appreciate the time and I really appreciate what you guys do and on behalf  
**[1:15:47-1:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:15:47):**  of the rest of my team and yeah very grateful for this opportunity and yeah I would love  to check in with you again in a year or two's time to see how we've evolved.  Absolutely.  
**[1:16:01-1:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:16:01):**  Thank you so much for listening all the way to the end for the show notes and links we  discussed in this episode check out our website investinginregenerativeagriculture.com forward  slash posts if you like this episode why not share it with a friend or give us a rating  
**[1:16:18-1:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:16:18):**  on Apple podcasts that really helps thanks again and see you next time.  Dear friends of the podcast I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:16:47-1:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:16:47):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course after a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of  audio asking the question how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been  
**[1:16:59-1:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:16:59):**  following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was  time to share our lessons learned what have we seen in the space over the last years how  have we built our decision making framework what to focus on with the podcast how have  
**[1:17:14-1:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:17:14):**  we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask what is happening in the space  what should you read what should you listen what should you watch how to approach this  space.  
**[1:17:25-1:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:17:25):**  For whom is this course you the soil builders and investors in the space the soil builders  people working in this space entrepreneurial farmers fund managers vehicle builders crowd  investing platform builders agtech companies farm to gut food companies permaculture key  
**[1:17:40-1:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:17:40):**  line designers holistic management consultants etc etc people that are building soil at scale  and the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[1:17:54-1:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:17:54):**  foundations institutional capital banks insurance companies etc.  Is this course free?  No this is pay what you think it's worth meaning I have no way of knowing what this course  
**[1:18:06-1:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:18:06):**  will be worth to you and I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast we have  people with very different means so I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you  and if you have the means to consider paying what you think it's worth thank you.  
**[1:18:22-1:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:18:22):**  So what is this course it's currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15  minutes plus PDF slides so you don't have to ride along we're gonna look into why investing  in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture is so risky how to invest what  
**[1:18:39-1:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:18:39):**  kind of frameworks you could and I think should build what to invest in what kind of co-investors  you could find or what kind of investors you could find if you're a soil builder every  lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports what kind  
**[1:18:53-1:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:18:53):**  of interviews what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper we're  gonna look at nutrient density landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not it's not a list of investable deals unfortunately that doesn't exist in  
**[1:19:06-1:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:19:06):**  this world we're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution  it's also not investment advice before making any investment please find professional investment  advice.  
**[1:19:18-1:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sven-verwiel#t=1:19:18):**  So get ready get a cup of coffee a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking click on the  link below sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

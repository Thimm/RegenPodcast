**[0:00:11-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:11):**  Now, on to the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:13):**  You will listen to an interview with Brad Clover on how he and his team put 160 million to work in regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:21):**  There are lessons learned on how we can scale this to the size which is absolutely necessary.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:26):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:33):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:47):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration? Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:56):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:05):**  In March last year, we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support our work.

**[0:01:31-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:31):**  Welcome to another episode of the podcast. I'm Koon Fon Sei, your host and today I interview Brad Clover, co-founder of Impact Ag Partners, which manages over 150 million Australian dollars in land assets.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:43):**  On behalf of international and domestic investors in Australia. Welcome, Brad.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:47):**  Thanks very much, Koon.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:48):**  To start with a personal question, how do you end up managing land, agriculture land on behalf of international clients and mostly focusing on soil?  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:59):**  Well, that's a good question. It's quite an interesting journey, I guess.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:04):**  And I guess it starts back from being a child living on a family farm in southern New South Wales in Australia and, you know, growing up on a family farm and I guess farming originally in a traditional way as my father and grandfather and forefathers had and what was standard practice in our community and our industry.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:27):**  Our farm was a sheep farm that we know we produced wool and, and meats and lambs and we started based on immigration from England and Scotland and I was part of a generation of farmers.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:42):**  So that's kind of the early days in my life.  
**[0:02:46-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:46):**  And that's quite a transition. I mean, you could have still man, I don't know what happened to the farmers, they still managed that farm, but actually, you did not you continue to move to a much more financial side of things. How did that happen?  
**[0:03:01-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:01):**  Yeah, so, you know, to continue on with that story, I, after going away, I'm working on in some corporate agricultural roles, some university study in agricultural economics, and some study in sustainable agriculture.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:18):**  I got really interested in the data associated with farming and I was very lucky to be involved in a what we call a benchmarking group of farmers, which is a collective of up to 30 farm businesses and a facilitator brings together all of those producers that are interested in comparative analysis, improvement and trying to understand what drives productivity and profitability on farming.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:44):**  So early in my career, and I'm going to say this is in my late 20s, I was on the family farm after being away for a few years and came back with, with a view on what can we do with this family farm to scale it up, make it more profitable.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:57):**  And I got involved in this benchmarking group and I got really interested in what drove superior performance.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:03):**  And I think from that deep dive into farm data and farm information and understanding what drove efficiency, what drove productivity, and then the outcomes of that, what drove profitability.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:16):**  So in that vein, then I started to look at besides financial performance, what else was happening in those ecosystems and, and I guess I soon started to realise that I felt that in some ways, economic performance was an outcome.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:36):**  And that outcome was at the cost of the environment and the society, the greater society.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:40):**  And I felt that there had to be a better way in terms of how we farm.  
**[0:04:45-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:45):**  And so I started to get more interested in sustainable agriculture, started to ask questions around how can we do this better, because we'd gone through good times in agriculture here in Australia, but there was also, you know, some tough times associated with drought.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:04):**  And through understanding farm data, I quickly understood that, you know, 60% of our farm profit was coming from only 20% of our years.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:14):**  So we had to really maximise those good years, because there was going to be some tight years.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:19):**  So how could we take out that variability?  
**[0:05:22-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:22):**  I was asking questions of our own business around, how can we take out volatility of our financial performance?  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:30):**  And how could we reduce the variability in the production of our plants?  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:36):**  And, and, you know, a lot of that came back to the soil.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:39):**  And a lot of that came back to how can we build resilience in our systems?  
**[0:05:44-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:44):**  So that we could be longer term more sustainable and build real resilience, not only at the financial level, but within our environments and resilience within our plants and also the animals that we're using as well.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:57):**  So that's kind of how I got to, I guess, thinking about creating a business, which became Impact Ag Partners.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:07):**  And, you know, Impact Ag Partners, we really believe that we only borrow our natural assets from our children.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:15):**  And we believe that, you know, in the production of food and fibre, it shouldn't be at the cost of the environment, and it shouldn't be at the cost of the human race globally.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:25):**  So our mission is about how can we have an impact and our objective here is to sit between the financial sector and the operating sector, which is the farming sector and help both of those participants deliver better than average, triple bottom line results.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:46):**  So that's economic results, environmental results, and results for the society at large.  
**[0:06:53-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:53):**  Wow, there's absolutely fascinating and there's a lot to unpack. I definitely want to dive deeper into how you're doing that.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:00):**  But I want to take one step back. When you started asking those questions to maybe to your family, but also to your peers in that benchmark group, what was the response?  
**[0:07:11-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:11):**  I think the response initially, and this is in the 1990s, when, to be perfectly honest, a lot of the agricultural community was very focused on driving profitability, scaling up, understanding efficiencies, where the next productive game was coming from.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:32):**  Like you were when you when you came back, you said, I wanted to scale it up and make it more profitable.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:37):**  That's exactly right. And if you take a step back from that, in Australia, and this is a little bit reflected globally, in the 1940s and 50s, we had the invention of mechanised agriculture, we saw machinery and tractors coming, which really changed the industry.  
**[0:07:51-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:51):**  And then in the 1980s, and the 1990s, we started to see the introduction of chemical agriculture, and we started to see the use of herbicides and, and less mechanisation and, you know, the chemicals such as glyphosate come into play and the impact that's had.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:07):**  And then in the early 2000s, we started to see businesses in agriculture, engage further up the value chain and start to be involved in vertical integration. And we saw a lot of investment come into vertical integration from the outside investment community.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:22):**  And then when here we are now, we're at a position whereby productivity gain is very minimal, one, 2%. We're seeing our consumers and our society saying we want ethically produced food and fibre, and we have an expectation of you the farmers that you're going to do the right thing.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:43):**  So it's an interesting journey. And I think we're really at an interesting point in time in terms of agriculture, food production, and how the consumers globally view agriculture and its output.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:57):**  Yeah, I think I can only imagine because I'm not in the sector for too long. Imagine the difference between the last 30 years from the 1990s till now, I think there's a momentum shift, I already see the last few years.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:11):**  And so getting back to impact ag partners, which is six, seven years old, if I'm right, what triggered that to start? Because it's quite a step from managing or wanting to scale up and make your family farm more profitable to actually managing quite a lot of land and quite a lot of assets on behalf of others.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:32):**  Yeah, that's a good question. Because I guess following on from being involved in, you know, getting a deep dive into farm data and what drives farming performance, I started to get asked to do external work off farm in terms of consulting and feasibility studies for third parties.  
**[0:09:51-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:51):**  And in that process, I got involved with some larger family offices that were farming here in Australia that were having some challenges in their business actually, and they and they came to me and said, Look, can you come and help, you know, work with our team on the ground and in improving productivity and with an idea towards driving better profitability and ensuring we've got a sustainable business model and looking for opportunities where we can extract more value from the market.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:19):**  Were they seeing the same things like, like the 60% of their profit came from only 20% of the years? Because that's quite a staggering data point.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:27):**  It is indeed. And I think, you know, investors were finding snippets of that data, but they're also also seeing what was happening on the ground and they're looking at their landscapes. And, you know, they come from a sophisticated business community, the majority of investors, and they understand that they have a social license, and they're astute, and they are always looking for areas of improvement.  
**[0:10:52-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:52):**  And I think they were looking and they were coming to me and saying, Can you find areas where we can improve and help my team improve to deliver better outcomes, you know, what we call better triple line outcome.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:04):**  So that's kind of what started the journey for impact ag partners. And from that, you know, our business has grown primarily through referral where people have either seen what we've done, heard about what we're doing, they've spoken to other family offices about agriculture as a, as an asset class, and that's driven interest.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:25):**  I mean, it's quite interesting because, you know, primarily, our investors are family offices. And, you know, UBS did a did a study on global family offices in 2018. And they delivered a report. And they did the survey of 311 family offices primarily out of North America that had about 1.1 billion under management.  
**[0:11:49-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:49):**  And 30% of those respondents have a direct investment in agriculture, which to me was encouraging. And 17% of those respondents had planned on allocating more in future.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:04):**  And I found that quite interesting in the early years of researching for impact ag what the opportunity was. And then we soon realised that what we were doing was actually delivering real impact.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:19):**  And when you think about how the impact investment movement has changed in the last five years, it has really grown and and the same 311 family offices that I talk about 40% said that in the next generation of those family offices, there was going to be a greater amount of their investments were going to be focused on impact investments.  
**[0:12:43-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:43):**  And agriculture is now seen in the family office community as the third greatest sector where they place their impact funds besides housing and education. Agriculture now is seen amongst the family office community as a class for investment and a real impact investment.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:01):**  Yeah, it's exactly the reason I'm doing this podcast coming out of the impact investing world and seeing agriculture high on the list of wish sectors or sectors I would like to allocate more capital to, but usually not high on the list of sectors, families and high net worth individuals actually allocated capital to so there's a gap there. And that's, I mean, that's why we're running these interviews to to interview the people that are shaping that sector and helping to put money to work big and small. And I think it's,  
**[0:13:31-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:31):**  it's starting to be seen as a sector maybe next to energy as well, which is an absolutely massive one, obviously, but one that actually can deliver and not just less negative impact, but actually positive impact in terms of food, but actually in terms of carbon as well. And so many sectors are touched by the food and agriculture sector, the way we we farm and use the land basically. So that that growth, I think is just going to continue and especially the next generation. I see it with the members. I work with  
**[0:13:58-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:58):**  at tonic that the next generation is really, really shifting gears and going into a whole new level when it comes to impact impact measurements allocation different systems that we never thought would be possible in portfolios and also portfolio build up very, very interesting and encouraging. And what was the first because you very deliberately called it impact egg partners. So what was the first project or one of the projects you say, okay, that's a typical that's what I'm very proud of something you you've managed to do in the past few years.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:28):**  With impact egg partners.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:30):**  I think one of the first assets under our management where we implemented real change, and we implemented change at multiple levels was an asset whereby it was it's in a strategically amazing landscape with very fertile red basalt soils, and a really fresh in Australian standards, reliable, consistent rainfall. And it was about taking that asset that had been under conventional farming until we purchased it.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:59):**  And then look at it and say, how can we extract better value? And how can we take this asset and have real impact for future generations? So one way we did that was primarily to change the way the livestock business was being run. We we changed the grazing management into a more large scale dynamic rotational grazing system.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:24):**  And we we went in there, and we utilised changes in the asset design in terms of the size of each field, the location of the water, we reduce the amount of chemical fertilizers, we used more biological products. We did a whole suite of measurement when we started the change management, that soil carbon, soil pH, fertility, cation exchange, you know,  
**[0:15:52-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:52):**  magnesium calcium ratios, a whole suite of measurements on the soil, a bunch of measurements on our plants that we were growing throughout our pastures in terms of biodiversity, the vegetation, identification, all of those sorts of things so that we could help demonstrate our impact.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:09):**  And then probably the third part of major impact was we were asking ourselves the question, how can we monetize? And how can we commercialize some of the impact we're having? So a way we did that was through a vertically integrated beef business. And so we tried to take that business to the market. And we actually sold wholesale beef and retail beef, both domestically here in Australia and exported under our own brand that helped  
**[0:16:39-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:39):**  try to bring more capital back to the farm gate, based on the story of regenerative agriculture and ecosystem services, and focusing on low stress stock handling, and humane treatment of animals and all those sorts of things in the story around the landscape. So that project kind of ticked a lot of the boxes for us in terms of proving our thesis, but also giving us the confidence to say yes, we want to do more of that.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:09):**  And there's a lot more to explore.  
**[0:17:39-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:39):**  Yeah, a lot of lessons there. And I think one of the things we did was trying to really understand consumer preference, consumer behavior, and what the conscious consumer was looking for. And I think, you know, we learned early on that, in terms of the red meat space, consumers in the market we were targeting, were quite confused. And they were confused about what grass fed meant grass fed, what they were looking for. And I think that was a really interesting thing.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:07):**  They were confused about what grass fed meant grass finished, free to roam, you know, they'll try and understand what good animal husbandry means, what's regenerative agriculture, what's sustainable agriculture. So there's a whole education process. And I think it's one that is still not fully understood. I still think there's a lot of work to be done there. But it's a really hard business when you're trying to differentiate a product that is sitting alongside  
**[0:18:37-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:37):**  conventional product. And especially when, and we'll probably talk about this a bit later, it's something I'm passionate about is the metrics that need to be associated to differentiate something like a product that's grown ethically and sustainably, as opposed to the metrics that are kept for a conventionally produced product.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:56):**  Yeah, because it seems the same when I'm at the shell, but obviously, hopefully it tastes very different. But then I only know when I'm in my kitchen, and I prepared it. So you have basically the packaging to play with when when you're there. Am I right?  
**[0:19:11-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:11):**  Well, that's right. And it's about, you know, how much space you've got on a label to tell your story? And what certifications can you utilise to differentiate yourself? And how robust are those certifications? And are the other certifications on your competitors? Are they being third party audited? And so there's a whole education process there. And it's really the sophisticated consumer that can understand the differences between products.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:38):**  So, like most consumers, they're time poor, and they're looking for convenience. And it's got to be a succinct message, a sharp message and not confusing. So as an industry, there's plenty of work to be done.  
**[0:19:51-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:51):**  And when you look at the metrics, you mentioned you did a huge survey or a huge metric work at the beginning. What were the results over time? I'm imagining you measured over time as well. How fast did you see certain things change? Imagine I'm, we are the investor that commissioned this work. What would I see in the field? Or what would you be able to tell me after year three and then year five, in terms of differences? And in this case, obviously, I'm not a farmer.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:21):**  So I might see that all the animals are in the same group. And I might see some other small things. But what would be the differences that I can see from the old system of management to basically a few years out in the new system?  
**[0:20:33-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:33):**  Okay, so I'll break this down in three pieces to start with, with the soil. Primarily, we would see scientific data that would demonstrate something like our carbon levels went from 1.5%.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:47):**  Which is extremely low, just to put it in perspective, right?  
**[0:20:50-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:50):**  Yeah, exactly. 1.5% in year one, and by year five, that was up to 5.5%. So that was quite a good change in income.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:01):**  And that was without bringing any outside manure etc. in, it was just the management.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:06):**  It's primarily based on getting our plants to work and sequester carbon on our behalf. So that's the soil level, and not only carbon in the soil, you know, we were changing how friable the soil was, the soil's capacity to hold moisture.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:21):**  But carbon seems to be a good proxy there, right? Is what I learned in these 50 episodes I've recorded so far.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:27):**  Yeah, carbon is the proxy for soil health, that's exactly right. And then so from a plant's point of view, we saw a change in diversity. So all of a sudden where we might have seen, you know, four or five variety of plants in our pastures, we were starting to see herbs and forbs and a bunch of other plants.  
**[0:21:46-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:46):**  So we, I think, I haven't got the data in front of me, but something like, you know, species numbers of eight, and then over a five year period, getting up to sort of 23 and 24, purely based on a rotational grazing system and those plants too.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:02):**  So nothing planted for you basic by you basically, plants that were either already there or replanted or refertilized or re spread by your common or your livestock management.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:14):**  That's right. So there was no introduced plants in that that was all just by changing the way that the animals were grazing the plants, giving the plants time to regenerate, and also asking those plants to drive their roots deeper and access nutrients and access moisture at depth to make those plants more resilient.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:34):**  So there's less change within the plant community and the composition of all those plants because they're lasting longer, and they're more resilient. So then, from the animal's point of view, you end up with a more balanced diet, you end up with animals being able to graze a whole suite of products that, you know, those plants are offering all the nutritional requirements that they need.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:56):**  So improved animal health, less requirement for human intervention in terms of animal health, they become psychologically happier, they're calmer over time, those animals, you know, are easier to manage, there's less risk to the people that are working them. And because they're less stressed, they perform better.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:16):**  That's, that's absolutely fascinating. I heard a term that when cows have or livestock have this suite of options, diversity, they basically are able to self medicate, and already prevent a lot of things that we otherwise had to interfere for. And I even heard a story, I think it was in the UK, when cows had the opportunity to, to go on the beach, they actually would eat certain algae, I think it was also an Australian story, actually, I will link it below and eat certain algae, which reduce greatly their methane,  
**[0:23:47-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:47):**  their methane production, and they were able to select which one actually worked for them, obviously, as they have done for for a great number of time. So it was it, there's an interesting thing out there on psychology, and be able to choose instead of one or two or eight types of plants choose from 23.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:04):**  I think, if I look, one year ago, what's changed, I mean, in the last 12 months, what's changed, I mean, we've taken an example like that farm. And based on some of those results, we've seen an increase in deal flow, we've seen new investors who have been introduced to us through a referral, come to us looking for investments in agriculture, and they see ag as a new asset class.  
**[0:24:34-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:34):**  To add to their portfolio, sometimes seen as a real asset, but it's generally there as a long term asset. It's not, it's not liquid. So it's there for long term. And we've seen an increase in deal flow. I mean, that's probably got a bit to do with global financial markets, geopolitical interactions around the world. And I think the whole focus on feeding a global population, and it just so happens that Australia is really well positioned to Asia.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:05):**  Where a lot of that population growth is going to come from, we have seen an increase in deal flow.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:10):**  And then what what excites you at the moment? Or what are the new customers asking for? What's what's on your mind? Like the last few months? What I've been working on? If that's something you can share? Obviously, if there's a specific project you're very excited about, or specific, in this case, client relationship, what is the important pieces that are being worked on at impact ag partners at the moment?  
**[0:25:32-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:32):**  So, you know, I think there's two things that are really exciting at the moment that we're pursuing. The first one is we see more and more opportunity to bring more revenue back to the farm gate for farmers who are delivering ecosystem services. And we're seeing more and more small markets opening up for biodiversity management, carbon markets globally, we're seeing  
**[0:26:02-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:02):**  environmental finance starting to emerge, which is a little bit like green finance. And so what do you mean by that? Do you have an example? Because I've seen the first carbon credits being paid, I think in Australia a month ago, on a farm project, but what do you mean by environmental finance? So we're starting to see large corporations trying to place capital, whereby the outcomes are delivering environmental impacts. So whether it's investment in  
**[0:26:31-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:31):**  renewable energy, or if it's something like green finance, where it's supporting on farm energy efficiency, or even at the point whereby if farmers are delivering ecosystem services, so it might be reducing nutrient runoff, increasing biodiversity, increasing ground cover, reducing waste, we're seeing financial products being designed, whereby they will help reduce the cost of the economy.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:01):**  And that will reduce a farmer's interest rates with related debt to the, you know, the tune of even up to 100 basis points to reduce their finance costs if they're delivering measurable ecosystem services. So these are the sorts of areas that we're working on the moment that we're very excited about.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:20):**  And it's very interesting, because then it hits your your bottom line immediately. And your CFO, if you have one, exactly, very excited about paying less interest. I think it's, I've seen one, not related to ag, but that, I mean, actually, indirectly is obviously because they're known as a huge ag company. But they had a consortium of banks, I think one of them was being paid by the bar. And their loan was the interest rate on their loan was connected to you and had a certain spread, it could follow.  
**[0:27:50-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:50):**  Based on how they were scoring on sustainability. And that was quite a bit of money that it saved them if they would hit certain sustainability targets by having heard, I've been waiting for like this type of outcome based schemes where could be ground cover could be nutrients could be etc. It always depends who is paying for it in this case, it's very interesting that it's connected to certain depth structures. That's fascinating.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:15):**  Yeah, it's fantastic. And so and the second initiative that we're working on the moment is, is we have a client that has created an impact fund. And that fund is purely based around supporting and demonstrating regenerative agriculture. So we're, we're rolling over existing land assets. And we're also investing in things like soil carbon measuring businesses. We're looking at things such as green finance, where biological fertilizers are being used.  
**[0:28:45-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:45):**  As companies, we're looking at technology, and investing in technology. And this is all about regenerative agriculture, and about trying to help demonstrate to the investment community, what we can do from an impact point of view in regenerative agriculture. So that's  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:02):**  so that's basically a fund that is set up. Is it only Australia or is it outside Australia as well?  
**[0:29:07-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:07):**  So some of the assets are outside of Australia. And we are first and foremost focusing here, but quite likely will have global impacts and global investments. So that's a really neat initiative we're very passionate about.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:23):**  Yeah, because it looks across the whole value chain. Basically, it's not because a lot of the region ag funds I see are focused purely on land, we buy land, we regenerate it. That's where the revenue comes from. But you're mentioning looking at biological fertilizer and technologies. It almost becomes a sector fund, but not just focused on land, which is, again, I've been waiting for that, but absolutely fascinating.  
**[0:29:45-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:45):**  Yeah, it is. And look, for us at Impact Ag Partners, we're building the framework and designing how this should look, and helping structure this. So in due course, you know, I'll be able to share with you what that looks like.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:03):**  Please do.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:04):**  I think something that we're really passionate about, and one thing that we're working on in the background is the importance of harmonizing the metrics for agricultural impact investments. So what are all the metrics that we need to capture? You know, they need to be production, they need to be around financial performance and profit, but they need to be about the soil metrics, the plant metrics, you know, all the environmental metrics.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:33):**  And then on top, there's all the social implications as well. So one of the initiatives we're working on with some some other global players from Europe, and the US is about how can we harmonize the metrics that we measure? And what are the right metrics to measure?  
**[0:30:52-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:52):**  And then how can we streamline this so that we've got something clear, and something that's easily reported on and communicated to the investment community? Because some of the feedback we get from the investment community is that impact investments have metrics that sometimes don't correlate, they are confusing.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:13):**  They're measured in different ways to get the same outcome. So in the agriculture space, how can we get on the front foot in harmonizing these metrics? So it's an initiative that we're working on in 2019. And we're collaborating with a group of other participants, NGOs, foundations, family offices, global asset managers in agriculture. So that's another initiative.  
**[0:31:40-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:40):**  It's a bit like what's necessary. I mean, they're they're consumers at the end. And it's a bit like what's needed in the consumer space as well. What in such a complex story? Like, yes, you can actually use agriculture to regenerate even whole landscapes if you wanted to. But how do you bring that down to a report you send four times a year or twice a year? Or how do you bring it down to basically a label you see for a few seconds before you decide to go left or right? That's going to be on both sides, it's going to be a huge  
**[0:32:10-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:10):**  challenge, but absolutely essential to get much more money, much more smart money into the space. And at the same time, get more and more consumers to actually join the positive side of agriculture and food and not just less negative, which is absolutely key. But we need to switch that momentum to and switch that paradigm to, okay, what are we going to how come are we going to store all that carbon? How are we going to change the agriculture system? Not as metrics are I mean, everybody always talks about metrics in the investing sector, but that  
**[0:32:39-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:39):**  doesn't mean they're not important. And to is that one of the main barriers you see to for the sector to region ag and food sector to scale further, that the lack of metrics or are there other barriers you see that that should be be taken away or should be worked on by by this community?  
**[0:32:56-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:56):**  Yeah, so I think the metrics are there. It's just I think initially, it's to simplify the metrics and make them common amongst those practitioners. Because in order to attract more capital regenerative agriculture, we do have to demonstrate those metrics. And I think one of the reasons why one of the outcomes of demonstrating this is that hopefully we can help monetise more of those ecosystem services. So I think, you know,  
**[0:33:27-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:27):**  if we can monetise ecosystem services, and if we can encourage governments to use a bit of a carrot and stick approach, whereby if you're a farmer, and you're doing the right thing, and you're regenerating your landscapes, and implementing social good, you should be rewarded. And for the farmer that isn't doing those things using traditional methods, you know, contaminating land, not regenerating land,  
**[0:33:55-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:55):**  driving down natural capital, you know, there should be a stick approach, and there should be ramifications for that. So that's why I think these metrics are important. I think if we can monetise the ecosystem benefits, it helps promote and encourage farmers that are doing the right thing to do more of the right thing. And it should give them more access to capital, because access to capital is one of the barriers to more regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:21):**  And if you put that on top of generational change, I think, with succession planning, and you know, farmers are getting older all the time, we need to make agriculture appealing to the next generation. So that if we can help monetise ecosystem services, so that we've got the best farmers farming our land, if we can capitalise those farmers so that they can get on and drive growth businesses, and be prepared to get in and be entrepreneurs,  
**[0:34:52-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:52):**  on their land without a noose of long term debt, and free up the capital market. I think we've got a we're really well positioned to achieve all the things that people like you and I want to achieve.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:05):**  And I don't know if this is an appropriate question, because I don't know if the farm is still in the family. But if that would happen, would, and if that would have happened 30 years ago, would have had been interesting for you to come back to the farm, if the ecosystem services if the what you described now would have been in place, then would it be would have been something for you to be excited as an entrepreneur, and maybe even a regenerative entrepreneur on the family farm?  
**[0:35:29-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:29):**  Yes, it would have been but I still wonder whether it would have been enough to keep me on the farm, whether I would have been stimulated enough on the farm, but no doubt it would have helped scale the business,  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:40):**  you would probably have started a few few side businesses.  
**[0:35:43-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:43):**  Well, most probably because there's so much to do, you know, whether it's technology relating to regenerative agriculture, whether it's businesses that are more consumer facing, I mean, I think one of the barriers, you mentioned barriers to regenerative farmers, I think consumer expectations have and their consumer behaviours have to change.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:36:04):**  I mean, if they, I think, if their expectations are around ethical production, food and fibre, they're going to be prepared to pay for that. And a lot of consumers, you look at consumer survey data, what they say they're passionate about, and then what they actually do with their dollars and how they spend their money are sometimes two different things.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:36:25):**  They say they care about ethical production and the environment, but they don't also always do that with their purchasing behaviour and their decision. So I think if consumers can recognise that in the past, they've bought food and it's been at relatively low financial costs, but it's been at the cost of the environment.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:36:46):**  If we can change their mindset from commodity based food, to premium high quality, nutrient dense food, clean food, slow food, I think that's when we can really start to capture more change.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:36:59):**  And I want to be conscious of your time as well and finish up with some final questions. If you look at the investor landscape, I mean, you're working with some very, very forward thinking families. Imagine there's a room full of impact investors listening to this podcast, let's imagine it's in a gigantic room, a theatre. And they're all starting to get very interested in soil. They've read the books, they've read Kate Brown, they've read Charles Massey, and they would like to start what would be your obviously not investment  
**[0:37:29-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:29):**  advice, but it would be your advice, where to start? What kind of questions should you ask? As you've been in many of these situations, what would be a good first step for for someone that wants to put some of his capital to or her capital to work in regenerating soils?  
**[0:37:46-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:46):**  I think the first thing is to find the right partners. I think it's a long term partnership. And what I've learned with the family offices we work with is that it's a partnership. And you need to find those partners that have got the experience in regenerative agriculture. Number one, they capture the metrics and can demonstrate performance, whether it's financial performance or environmental and social performance. I think beyond that, they also, you've got to be at the forefront.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:16):**  of entrepreneurship around identifying trends around consumer behavior, trends around social license, understanding global supply and demand trends. And you've got to, you know, investors have got to look for those thought leaders that are out there, looking for opportunities that are going to help increase the value of their assets, but also help those businesses that are operating on those assets extract more values through, you know,  
**[0:38:45-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:45):**  their good land stewardship and creating businesses that have the capacity to go further up the value chain and be rewarded for their land stewardship. So you're creating value at the asset level and value at the business level. I think there, that would be my advice finding those people.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:39:07):**  And this is really the final question. If you could change one thing overnight, if you could wave your magic wand, and bet could change one thing in the agriculture industry or the regenerative ag and food industry, what would you change? And what would we wake up to tomorrow? And think, well, that that's completely shift, what would be the one thing if you can dream incredibly big?  
**[0:39:28-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:39:28):**  I think, just off the top of my head, as you asked that question, if we could reward farmers that were delivering environmental and social good, and help them be rewarded to bring more revenue on farm so they can reinvest in their assets and reinvest in their businesses. I think by rewarding those good farmers, that would be a really good start in the sort of change that we'd like to see in the food and fiber sector.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:39:57):**  I think it's a perfect answer. And a perfect finish of this interview. But I want to thank you so much. I'll definitely be checking in dive deeper into the different projects you're developing. They all sound interesting enough to spend a whole podcast on honestly, but we don't have the time today. So I'm going to close it off. And I hope to see you back soon on the podcast. Thank you so much. Thanks very much.

**[0:41:33-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:41:33):**  Why are we doing this course after 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned. What have we seen in the space over the last years? How have we built our decision making framework? What to focus on with the podcast? How have we picked interviewees? And what questions should you ask? What is happening in the space? What should you read? What should you?  
**[0:42:03-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:42:03):**  Listen, what should you watch? How to approach this space for whom is this course you the soil builders and investors in the space, the soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing platform builders, act tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc, etc.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:42:26):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:42:41):**  Is this course free? No. This is pay what you think it's worth. Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast and we have people with very different means.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:42:55):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to consider paying what you think it's worth. Thank you.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:43:04):**  So what is this course? It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:43:14):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:43:30):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper. We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:43:44):**  So what is it not? It's not a list of investable deals. Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world. We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:43:53-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:43:53):**  It's also not investment advice.

### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Fri, 18 Feb 2022 17:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:15):**  Welcome to Soil Builders, a series where we follow who is building soils at scale.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:19):**  This is an experiment, so please share any feedback.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:22):**  Why this show Soil Builders?  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:23):**  I believe that most change in regenerative agriculture and food will come from and is  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:27):**  coming from entrepreneurs building ways to regenerate soil at scale.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:32):**  I call these Soil Builders.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:34):**  Soil Builders are entrepreneurial farmers, ag tech companies, investment funds, food  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:37):**  startups, new seed cooperatives, teams within food companies, robot startups, investment  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:42):**  vehicles, etc. etc. etc.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:45):**  All regenerating soil beyond their own farm gate and with more than their own money.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:49):**  This series allows the community of the podcast, which is you, full of funders, investors and  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:54):**  fellow soil builders to follow their progress, their challenges and their breakthroughs.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:00:58):**  I hope you enjoy it and please reach out with any comments, feedback and ideas.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:01:05):**  Today we have Pete of Ubi, working hard to make local and organic food easy and fair  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:01:09):**  in the UK.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:01:11):**  And Wolfgang of Saving Grains, turning post-harvest losses into profits for smallholder farmers.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:01:16):**  But first over to Pete.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:01:17):**  Pete, could you briefly introduce yourself and what brought you to FoundUbi?  
**[0:01:21-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:01:21):**  Hi Koen.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:01:22):**  I'm Pete Russell and I founded Ubi over a decade ago because I recognize that our centralized  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:01:28):**  global food systems were causing more damage than good.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:01:33):**  That was the industry I was in and I had a firsthand experience of that.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:01:39):**  And it's not by design, but by consequence of economic incentives.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:01:43):**  In the pursuit of greater and greater economies of scale, food corporations have been forever  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:01:48):**  consolidating and centralizing.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:01:51):**  Reproduction methods have been optimizing for maximum yield at minimal cost.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:01:56):**  And the food itself is optimized for the demands of long convoluted supply chains and for merchandising  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:02:03):**  rather than for nourishment.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:02:06):**  So Ubi was founded as a solution, as a short, fast and simple sales and distribution model,  
**[0:02:19-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:02:19):**  which is designed to bring economies of small scale, if you will, which can actually compete  
**[0:02:27-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:02:27):**  with mainstream food at the retail end of the market, whilst ensuring that all the actors  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:02:34):**  within the supply chain, in particular the food growers, are receiving the right proportion  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:02:40):**  of the retail pound.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:02:42):**  And what is the biggest difference for farmers working with you compared to working by themselves  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:02:46):**  or working with others?  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:02:47):**  I'd say the biggest difference for farmers working with Ubi compared to working by themselves  
**[0:02:53-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:02:53):**  or with others is that they have a comprehensive system with Ubi wrapped with full support  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:03:01):**  so that they can easily manage a direct sales model to households and businesses in their  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:03:06):**  local region.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:03:07):**  This means that farmers can often double or even triple their margins without needing  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:03:13):**  to become experts in sales and distribution.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:03:16):**  And what makes Ubi so unique in the direct to consumer marketplaces, which is slowly  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:03:22):**  getting more crowded?  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:03:23):**  What makes Ubi unique in the crowded space of direct to consumer marketplaces is that  
**[0:03:29-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:03:29):**  it's primarily designed around the logistics, coordinating and streamlining the delivery  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:03:38):**  process from gate to plate.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:03:41):**  Collating an ever changing range of perishable goods from small and independent suppliers  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:03:48):**  is a complex task.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:03:51):**  And platforms like Shopify or Etsy, they're great at the initial sales side, but they  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:03:57):**  like any of the logistical tools that are needed by food hubs to sort of manage a very  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:04:03):**  complex supply chain operation in order to deliver on that sale.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:04:09):**  So the first sale to a customer is the easy sale.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:04:11):**  You're just selling an idea really, but it's the second, third and subsequent sales that  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:04:15):**  make a food marketplace work.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:04:18):**  And that heavily depends on the entire customer experience working for the customer, including  
**[0:04:25-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:04:25):**  it arriving on time in the right place in full and as fresh as expected every time.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:04:33):**  So that's our focus.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:04:35):**  It's on optimizing for the recurring sales rather than just acquiring customers.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:04:42):**  And so whilst people can easily buy one off deliveries on Ubi, the system defaults to  
**[0:04:49-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:04:49):**  a subscription model and the customer dashboard encourages add on purchases without disrupting  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:04:56):**  the recurring sales pattern.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:04:58):**  So I think that's how we're different primarily.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:03):**  The customer experience on Ubi is that they know that they're shopping with a local independent  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:12):**  farm and that's the primary experience.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:13):**  They're shopping with someone in their region and with real provenance.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:19):**  But they are also aware that they're doing this via the Ubi platform.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:24):**  So it's similar to Etsy in that way.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:26):**  You know you're buying from an independent vendor, but you also know that you're doing  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:30):**  it on the Etsy platform.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:32):**  The Ubi is visible to the customer, to the household, but it stands behind the farmers  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:39):**  and the food hubs.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:40):**  And the farmers are the champions that are put front and center.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:45):**  Could you walk me through a use case?  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:47):**  Let's say I'm a typical farmer and I'm reaching out to you.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:50):**  How does the process of joining and using Ubi look like?  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:53):**  The use case for farmers is evolving over time.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:05:57):**  At this stage, we're really focused on building out the logistics network.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:06:03):**  And so we're working with farms that also act as distribution hubs.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:06:10):**  These are the farms that may produce a portion of the products for sale to the customers,  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:06:15):**  but they also buy in goods from other producers in order to provide a full range of staple  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:06:20):**  items for the households.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:06:23):**  So in this case, the joining experience is a high touch process where we work closely  
**[0:06:29-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:06:29):**  with the farm hubs to help them to set them up on the platform and to train them on how  
**[0:06:37-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:06:37):**  to run a full logistical operation in order to do home deliveries from their farm.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:06:46):**  In due course, we'll be enabling farmers that don't want to be hubs to simply create a supplier  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:06:53):**  account where they can create a profile and upload their available produce and products  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:06:59):**  to be purchased in bulk by the network of hubs on the platform.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:05):**  So customers will be able to buy from these suppliers via their local hubs, and these  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:10):**  suppliers won't need to deal directly with the thousands of customers.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:15):**  They'll be able to sell in bulk, but they'll have a platform that presents them to the  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:19):**  thousands of customers.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:22):**  And so for these farmers, it'll be a much simpler self-onboarding process in much the  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:27):**  same way as a vendor would set themselves up on something like Etsy.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:30):**  And now to Wolfgang of Saving Grains.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:32):**  Hi, Wolfgang.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:33):**  Welcome to the podcast.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:34):**  Could you briefly introduce yourself and what brings you to focus on grains in West Africa?  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:39):**  Thanks, Goan, for having me.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:40):**  It's a real pleasure.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:41):**  I'm Wolfgang.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:42):**  I worked for the World Food Program for quite a while.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:46):**  They are focused on market-based interventions.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:48):**  Together with the accelerator, they have a great accelerator there.  
**[0:07:53-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:07:53):**  And so we try to address systemic market inefficiencies to help smallholder farmers escape poverty.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:03):**  So after a while, we focus on post-harvest losses.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:07):**  And basically, we've seen this huge opportunity to have a scalable business addressing these  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:13):**  issues.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:14):**  And that's why we found Saving Grains.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:16):**  Now, the reason we went to West Africa to start with our platform was that we simply  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:21):**  got some support from the Austrian Development Agency to get our model up and running.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:26):**  And could you share what Saving Grains is?  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:29):**  Saving Grains is our social startup.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:30):**  We are building a digital platform to revamp the village crop trade in sub-Saharan Africa.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:38):**  And the problem we are addressing is that smallholders always sell during the harvest,  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:43):**  and prices are really low.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:45):**  Now, prices go up within six months towards lean season.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:49):**  And in Ghana, it's a whopping 80% price increase on average.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:53):**  Now, all of this money doesn't stay in the village.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:08:58):**  But smallholders sell to traders, and outside the village, and the value trades outside  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:09:05):**  the village benefit from this price increase.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:09:07):**  Now, we are revamping that.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:09:10):**  But our starting point is not the farmer, but we enable local entrepreneurs to store  
**[0:09:17-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:09:17):**  hermetically.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:09:18):**  We provide them with hermetic storage technology, as well as a loan that we give them and an  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:09:26):**  app.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:09:27):**  Now, this holistic package combined allows them to buy grain in the community from smallholders,  
**[0:09:36-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:09:36):**  and then to store for a long time without any quality issues or any post-harvest losses,  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:09:44):**  and subsequently sell and make on average 80% in profits.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:09:48):**  Now, they also have to invest some money, but due to the loan, it gets very profitable  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:09:53):**  for them.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:09:54):**  Now, since all these transactions and all the money flows run out via our app, it's  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:01):**  possible to automatically deduct the profit share that we pay back to the smallholder  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:07):**  farmer so that they benefit from that value creation.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:12):**  Yeah, this is in a nutshell our first product.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:16):**  And we think it's a very scalable product.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:19):**  Yeah, and at the moment, we're doing this in Ghana and testing our first market proof  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:24):**  with 100 customers.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:25):**  But we have plans to prove that this model works for different crops, for maize, for  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:30):**  beans, for groundnuts.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:33):**  And we also want to enter East Africa and Kenya and maybe to Nigeria to show that this  
**[0:10:38-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:38):**  is not like a local solution.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:40):**  But this is something where we hopefully can get better prices for millions of farmers.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:46):**  And how does it make a difference for the farmers involved?  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:48):**  Now, that one is really simple.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:51):**  And our farmers receive a profit share.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:54):**  So the customers buy from the smallholder farmers, they make a big trading profit, and  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:10:59):**  our app automatically takes a part of the profit and pays it back to the smallholder  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:11:03):**  farmer.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:11:04):**  And what's really neat is that the profit share comes in the lean season.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:11:08):**  That's the time when everybody's broke, when farmers need to invest into their cultivation,  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:11:13):**  but there's no money, the time when the family starts skipping meals.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:11:17):**  So it's money when it's most needed.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:11:19):**  Now, if you look at the numbers, our entrepreneurs make 80% in trading profits on average.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:11:30):**  So 10% of the trading profit we take out of this, and this goes to the smallholder farmer.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:11:37):**  Now this doesn't seem very much, but if you look at the numbers and at the margins that  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:11:43):**  smallholders make, they're fairly low.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:11:46):**  If you look at crop budgets, and I mean, there's variation depending on the type of grain and  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:11:52):**  the type of cultivation and if they need external labor or not, but margins are typically between  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:11:57):**  5% and 20% to 25%.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:12:00):**  Now, if you give an extra 8% on top of this, it is significant.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:12:06):**  And the smallholder farmers we talked to, I mean, obviously they love that because there's  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:12:11):**  no risk on their part, no behavior change required.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:12:14):**  So for them, it's a pure win.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:12:18):**  But there's also like a business reason behind this because we are a social business and  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:12:22):**  we need to make money as well to be able to scale this rapidly.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:12:28):**  So we give a loan to our customers.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:12:33):**  And in Africa, as you well know, you have to make sure that you get the money back if  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:12:37):**  you loan out money.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:12:39):**  Now what is really interesting is that in this model, everybody wins in the village.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:12:46):**  So should there be a problem with the default, then we can communicate to the smallholder  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:12:52):**  farmers and with the traders to find a solution.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:12:56):**  Because obviously, if you farmers expect a profit share, it's a very uncomfortable for  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:13:01):**  a situation for a crops trader not to pay that profit share.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:13:06):**  So it doesn't make sense for our customers to default on their loan and be unpopular  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:13:15):**  in their village.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:13:16):**  There's a big social element of this.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:13:18):**  There's also a social element that we completely underestimated that our customers love the  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:13:25):**  social position.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:13:26):**  They love to be in the position to be the source of a profit share and extra money to  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:13:31):**  farmers.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:13:32):**  So we're very happy about this social element, and we find that it's very well intertwined  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:13:40):**  the social element of the business element.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:13:42):**  And compared to other solutions, how is it fundamentally different?  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:13:47):**  Most sub Saharan African markets are completely dominated by traditional crop trading, which  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:13:52):**  means the trader comes in the village, buys grain, grain travels through aggregation centers  
**[0:13:58-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:13:58):**  and to population centers, and all these indices and the price increases run up in later parts  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:14:06):**  of the value chain outside of the village.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:14:09):**  Now our solution as described is obviously very different and has many advantages.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:14:14):**  We formalize the crop trades to the traders.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:14:16):**  They get a loan, they get a financial history, they get transparency over their own trading  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:14:22):**  activities, and there's profit shares to smallholders.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:14:26):**  So it's a big step to what's currently happening.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:14:32):**  Now there's other digital approaches, very interesting ones like EcoCenter or AFIX Nigeria,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:14:39):**  Safari Comm is also working on solutions.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:14:44):**  But what makes our, what distinguishes our solution from others is that we are completely  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:14:51):**  free platform.  
**[0:14:53-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:14:53):**  Now other solutions are more captive, so they use these crowd elements to basically aggregate  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:15:02):**  themselves.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:15:03):**  They sort of like use this more as an agent model, but the crop is controlled by them.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:15:09):**  Whereas we are a free platform, we really build on the entrepreneurial energy and activity  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:15:16):**  of our customers, and they can buy grain and sell grain to anybody they like as long as  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:15:22):**  it goes through our app.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:15:26):**  There's also an additional element to our business model where we also offer a connection  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:15:31):**  to other markets, especially the urban markets and the big off takers since we have higher  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:15:37):**  quality grain.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:15:39):**  But this is not mandatory.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:15:40):**  We just offer our customers a price for their grain, and they can accept or reject it depending  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:15:48):**  on the other opportunities they have to trade.  
**[0:15:52-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:15:52):**  So we really build on this, being the tool for like hundreds and thousands of entrepreneurs  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:16:00):**  to become small businesses or even bigger businesses in growth.

**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:16:49):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:16:54):**  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, how to put money to work in regenerating

**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:17:02):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:17:03):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:17:08):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:17:13):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:17:55-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:17:55):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:17:58):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:01):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:12):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:14):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:18):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:18:23-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:23):**  different means.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:24):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:29):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:32):**  Thank you.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:33):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:18:34-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:34):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:41):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:42):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:47):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:53):**  invest in, what kind of co investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:57):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:18:59):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:19:04):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:19:08):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:19:13):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:19:14):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:19:16):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:19:18):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:19:22):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:19:24):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-7/#t=0:19:29):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

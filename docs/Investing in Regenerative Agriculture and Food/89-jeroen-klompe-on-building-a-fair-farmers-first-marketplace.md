**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:00:14):**  Why everything starts with biodiversity above and below ground and how one of the most advanced  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:00:19):**  regenerative farmers in the Netherlands is setting up a fair, farmers first marketplace  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:00:24):**  to connect farmers with buyers of ecosystem services.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:00:27):**  Not just carbon removal, but biodiversity and water storage as well.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:00:31):**  It might not be the most sexy part of regenerative agriculture, but it's absolutely crucial.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:00:36):**  How do we pay farmers for all the other services they provide beyond the food, the fibers and  
**[0:00:40-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:00:40):**  the oil they, hopefully using regenerative practices, produce for us?  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:00:47):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:00:51):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:00:52):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:00:57):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:01:02):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:01:06):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:01:09):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:01:12):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:01:15):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:01:20):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:01:24):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:01:28):**  our work.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:01:29):**  And so many of you have joined as a member.

**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:01:49):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:01:50):**  Welcome to another interview of investing in regenerative agriculture today with Jeroen  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:01:55):**  Klompe.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:01:56):**  We're live.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:01:57):**  We haven't done too many interviews live actually in this series or in any of the podcasts.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:02):**  I'm very happy to do that because it always adds a bit, especially after lockdown to be  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:07):**  able to not do this through a laptop.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:10):**  Jeroen Klompe is the co-founder of Klompe Landbouw, Klompe Agriculture and Soil Heroes.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:14):**  And he's building with the team a farmers first fair chain model to connect buyers of  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:20):**  ecosystem services directly with farmers.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:21):**  They have the slogan, don't compensate, but regenerate.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:25):**  And full disclosure, I'm an advisor to Soil Heroes and I'm very much looking forward.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:29):**  We've been talking about this interview, I think for the last three, four years.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:32):**  I'm very much looking forward to learn more.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:35):**  Fair chain, farmers first, compensate, don't compensate, but regenerate.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:39):**  So welcome Jeroen.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:40):**  Thanks, Kul.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:41):**  And we're here at your farm.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:42):**  So we're going to hear some, probably some background noises of large machinery, et cetera,  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:47):**  which is very suitable because obviously we're not in a studio.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:50):**  I know a bit of your background story, but I think it's absolutely fascinating to unpack  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:54):**  that a bit.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:02:55):**  How did you end up running this farm just south of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, just  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:00):**  situated a bit.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:01):**  It's raining outside.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:02):**  We're in July, 2020.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:04):**  How did you end up running this farm?  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:05):**  How did you end up on the soil?  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:07):**  It's actually, it's a family business.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:10):**  So I'm a fourth generation farmer at the moment and the fifth generation is ready to step  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:15):**  in in a couple of years.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:17):**  My background is in farmland management, farmland investment.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:21):**  And I was always busy with building business models on and around farmland.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:29):**  How can we make the best out of a plot which is available?  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:34):**  And then you are going to look in a different way to soils and you can look at it for, let's  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:39):**  build houses on it, but you can also grow very beautiful food on it.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:45):**  And that was the starting point that we were going to start with working with soil.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:49):**  And I'm working with soil now for 25 years now that I've had a normal job for seven months  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:03:56):**  and then I became an entrepreneur and I still am an entrepreneur.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:04:00):**  And you took over the farm you bought actually, the family farm where here, like I said, just  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:04:06):**  south of Rotterdam, can you describe a bit the dimension, what should, as we're in audio,  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:04:12):**  people cannot see where we are.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:04:13):**  What should we imagine when we talk about the family farm you're running at the moment?  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:04:18):**  For the Dutch circumstances, it's not a small farm and not a very big farm.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:04:23):**  We are operating at this moment on 350 hectares and they are in a circle of, let's say, 10,  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:04:32):**  12 kilometers around the center of home.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:04:35):**  It's mostly divided into plots of 40 hectares.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:04:39):**  We are running a very diverse crop rotation.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:04:43):**  I think that 60-65% at this moment is in full transition to regenerative farming and the  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:04:51):**  rest is still conventional but sustainable.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:04:55):**  And on the regenerative side, we have already fields which are in transition for eight years  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:00):**  now.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:01):**  And so let's say eight, nine, ten years ago, was there one trigger?  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:06):**  Was it a process?  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:07):**  What was the trigger to, let's look different at soil?  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:11):**  Because you've been farming, you've been in farming, but you didn't have this super focus  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:17):**  on soil life, soil life, soil life.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:20):**  It actually started all with potatoes.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:23):**  That's probably a first in this podcast that somebody says that.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:25):**  Okay, explain.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:27):**  We were growing potatoes as one of the cash crops on this farm and I had a vision to build  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:32):**  a vertical short supply chain where we could deliver potatoes to families on a very short  
**[0:05:38-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:38):**  way, cutting out the middleman.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:41):**  And the big goal was that the children on the table would ask their mommies, oh mom,  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:47):**  can I get some extra potatoes because they are so extremely tasteful.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:51):**  That was my vision because if it's tasteful, if it's full of nutrients, people are going  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:05:56):**  to buy again and we can make a sustainable business model on it.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:01):**  Really demand driven.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:02):**  Yes, yes.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:04):**  Instead of calling, the opposite being called was my goal.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:08):**  And to achieve this, we're studying how a winery works.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:12):**  They have their own marketing, they have their own packing facilities, et cetera.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:16):**  So what are the ingredients to do this?  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:18):**  And then we learned, oh, you need to have a very good variety.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:23):**  You need to have very good soil and you have to feed those plants on a very right way.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:30):**  And it sounds easy, but it is complicated.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:34):**  So in the end, conclusion, it's all about building soil.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:38):**  If you have a healthy soil, you can grow healthy plants and healthy plants provide you with  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:43):**  healthy food.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:44):**  And what we've learned in the last years, if you have a healthy food with a lot of nutrients,  
**[0:06:49-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:49):**  it's extremely tasteful.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:51):**  So that was the starting point 10 years ago to start building soils.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:06:56):**  And therefore we needed to invest in our soils because you have the cooperation between the  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:02):**  organic matter, between the soil biology and the nutrients, and they have to go working  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:08):**  together.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:09):**  So we have to accelerate this whole system and this process.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:13):**  And that was not an easy way.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:16):**  You remember what was the first thing you did, like when you came to the realization,  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:21):**  it's about soil life, I have to invest in my soils or in our soils.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:26):**  What was the first step?  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:27):**  Because there are 5 million books, 10 million videos.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:30):**  Just the low hanging fruit, our organic matter level was low.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:35):**  So we were thinking, oh, we have to add compost because then we have a higher organic matter  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:41):**  level and then it will flow and it will go working.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:45):**  No.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:46):**  You added compost, but it didn't work.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:48):**  It didn't work.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:49):**  And then we were thinking, oh, our soils are compacted.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:51):**  So we were huge issue here in the Netherlands.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:54):**  We were going to decompact the soils.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:56):**  So we invested in CTF farming and also that kind of thing.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:07:59):**  So what is CTF farming?  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:01):**  So that all our crops are growing in unridden soil.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:04):**  So we're not compacting it.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:06):**  So you're always driving basically for anybody on the same lane.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:09):**  Same trend.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:10):**  Every year you only farm in between the lanes and you never drive on the fields that you're  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:15):**  farming.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:16):**  And then we were, for example, examining the amount of food for the plants in the soil.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:20):**  Oh, it was too low.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:21):**  So we add extra nutrients to it.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:23):**  Still not working.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:25):**  And then we learned through all our journeys around the world and my wife, she's an environmental  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:29):**  scientist.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:30):**  So she knows also a little bit about how ecosystem service works, of how ecosystems systems work.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:36):**  We need soil biology.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:37):**  We need life in the soil.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:39):**  We need more life in the soil.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:40):**  And I'm imagining she probably was saying that for a long time and maybe you were buying  
**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:45):**  your fancy equipment and driving on the same lane.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:48):**  I was not listening to that.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:50):**  Life, life, life.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:51):**  It can all be solved with investing in a lot of machinery.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:55):**  But that's not true.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:08:56):**  It's about investing in a lot of employees in the soil.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:00):**  And that's called earthworms, bacteria and fungi nowadays.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:03):**  So what's the, because there's a lot there and I'm pretty sure we're going to have your  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:08):**  wife Melanie on the podcast at some point as well to really dive deep into that.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:11):**  So let me ask one question on that.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:13):**  What's the weirdest thing you've done to build life in your soil?  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:17):**  Something you've 15 years ago or 10 years ago, even I would never.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:21):**  The weirdest thing would be the most surprising maybe.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:24):**  The most, the most surprising thing is that we have started making our own mother cultures  
**[0:09:30-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:30):**  and bio fertilizers on our farm to accelerate the biology in the soil.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:37):**  And that we could do that on our farm on a low cost base by just multiplying fungi and  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:43):**  bacteria from a very old forest.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:46):**  And it's just multiplying, multiplying, multiplying, and then adding the right nutrients to that.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:51):**  And then fermenting this with compost extractions in it, with the mother culture in it, with  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:56):**  milk, with yeast, et cetera.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:09:58):**  That's such a beautiful process, which is the 30 or 60 days process.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:03):**  And you can do that on your farm and you can use it for plant resilience, or you can use  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:08):**  it for increasing your biomass, or you can make your own inoculants for the compost or  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:12):**  the solid manure.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:13):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:14):**  So the fact that you could do that on the farm, you didn't have to buy a lot of fancy  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:20):**  equipment, but you needed to learn how to do that.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:22):**  And just, I mean, I think many have maybe seen it on very small farms, but this is a  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:26):**  massive 350 hectare farm, meaning you're doing this on a large scale.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:32):**  It's still small.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:33):**  It's not a factory, but it's definitely not a few pans and pots.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:36):**  It's a small brewery within our farm.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:39):**  And I always explained on the right way, you have to listen to nature because nature has  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:44):**  all the solutions for us.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:46):**  But we have lost connection with nature in the last 15, 50 years.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:50):**  And just how does nature solve those problems?  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:54):**  What are the companion crops of a cash crop with a certain disease?  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:58):**  How can they help each other?  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:10:59):**  That's all a way of thinking.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:01):**  And it's just by adding those very strategic fungi in your bio-fertilizers, you can make  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:08):**  the plants more resilient.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:09):**  And diseases won't attack your crops.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:12):**  And it's the same with what Melny has done with 800 kilometers of biodiversity lanes.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:18):**  Just introducing our natural enemies in our farms by combining nature and modern farming,  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:25):**  there is balance again and we don't have problems with efforts anymore.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:30):**  What is a biodiversity lane?  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:32):**  Just for people that...  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:33):**  We have written a computer program that we can calculate what is the most efficient part  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:38):**  of the field where we can farm.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:41):**  Cash crop.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:42):**  Cash crop.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:43):**  We are farming on that part and all the inefficient parts.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:45):**  All the edges.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:46):**  All the parts that you turn with the tractor.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:49):**  You don't really want to farm there.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:52):**  You're farming there in many European countries because you get subsidies for every extra  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:57):**  square meter you squeeze out.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:11:58):**  But you actually figured out it's not efficient to farm there, not effective at all.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:02):**  And you planted something else.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:03):**  Yes.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:04):**  And so we gave that back to nature.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:06):**  So we were sowing flower mixes, grass.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:09):**  You didn't give it back.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:10):**  In a sense, it's not that you just left it and let's see what comes up.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:13):**  No, you very deliberately planted a mix of flowers, biodiversity, plants that provided  
**[0:12:19-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:19):**  a home.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:20):**  That attracts bees, that attracts all the natural enemies of all the insects, etc.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:24):**  So on the island here, there are 800 kilometers of biodiversity edges.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:29):**  And what has been the impact on, let's say, the fields nearby?  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:33):**  It's extremely good for pollination.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:36):**  So all the crops we were growing, which depend on pollination, the yield has increased from  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:42):**  the moment.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:43):**  More than the yield you took away from not planting there.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:45):**  Because that's obviously the next question.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:47):**  Well, you plant a certain lane, a few, let's say, alongside the field, maybe one or two  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:53):**  meters wide or one meter wide.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:54):**  You lose that.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:55):**  It wasn't the most effective piece anyway.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:12:57):**  But it also increased the yield of the cash crop zone.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:01):**  Yeah, there was a leverage effect.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:03):**  From the moment we started with the biodiversity lanes and the field margins, we have stopped  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:09):**  using insecticides.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:11):**  Immediately.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:12):**  And what we've learned is that they can fly 100 meters into the fields and do their job.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:19):**  So if you have a field of 200 meters wide, you need to.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:22):**  You need on both sides, you need a biodiversity edge.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:26):**  And coming back to the bio-fertilizer, if you had to name one example of what has been  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:31):**  the impact on the soil?  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:32):**  What have you noticed over the last years for your main cash crops?  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:37):**  As an example, did you have to irrigate less?  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:39):**  Did you see better growth?  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:41):**  What has been the, apart from the fact that it's fun to make, much cheaper than buying  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:45):**  a lot of bio-fertilizer, what has been the impact on the farming?  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:49):**  What we are seeing after a couple of years is that the water holding capacity is increasing.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:54):**  So in dry periods, there is much more water available for the plants.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:13:58):**  So irrigation is going down.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:00):**  We can see that the depth of the roots is much deeper.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:04):**  We can see that the plants are stronger.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:06):**  They have a natural smile because they have more access to other micronutrients.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:11):**  So the fields feel better.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:13):**  Yes.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:14):**  It's funny because Jon Kemp always says the most advanced farmers, they walk into a field  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:18):**  and they sense, they feel, they see something is off or something is going well.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:24):**  You said these fields where you have been applying the right type of bio-fertilizer,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:27):**  homemade, they sense, they see, they feel better than others.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:32):**  The plants are stronger.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:34):**  They have bigger stems and they have a natural color shining finish on their leaves.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:40):**  And that's...  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:41):**  They seem healthy.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:42):**  Yeah, they seem healthy.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:43):**  So water holding capacity is going well.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:45):**  Plant resilience is better.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:47):**  Less irrigation, a little bit higher yields.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:49):**  And we can see after eight years that the cost price is going down because we are rebuilding  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:54):**  the battery of soils.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:56):**  And this sounds all amazing.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:14:58):**  You have your farm here.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:00):**  And actually I'm going to...  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:01):**  Let's stay with the brewery for a second because we actually have discussed one of the companies  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:05):**  you're a part of in a previous podcast.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:07):**  I will definitely link it below, which is Tomaso with Bert, the soy sauce brewery.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:11):**  I think it is an example of your quest for searching for direct to consumer or director  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:17):**  to consumer.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:18):**  You've done many things.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:19):**  You've done potatoes before.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:20):**  I know you've done others.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:21):**  Experiments, not all successful.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:22):**  Some yes, some not.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:24):**  How did, from the farmer perspective, and then we'll switch to the ecosystem services.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:28):**  How did the soy sauce happen?  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:30):**  Because we heard the version of the soy sauce company, how they found you, but how did that  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:33):**  happen and why is that so interesting from a farm perspective to be in soy, in grain,  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:39):**  in taste?  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:40):**  Because that came back there very strongly.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:41):**  I had to think of that obviously.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:42):**  What was the origin story from your side with the soy sauce company?  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:46):**  Yes, I was searching for new, as I'm always searching for new business models on soil  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:52):**  to have a higher financial impact.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:15:55):**  And therefore there was the upcoming movement of the green proteins and we wanted to have  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:02):**  more diversity in our crop rotation.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:05):**  So we started growing legumes, which are a nitrogen fixer for the soil.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:10):**  So it's good for the nitrogen balance of the farm.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:12):**  And we started with kidney beans, brown beans and white beans.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:17):**  And on a natural flow there came the soybeans also, because it's a product which is used  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:22):**  on a large scale.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:23):**  So I was looking if we can make some plant-based dairy from that or it was just a trial.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:30):**  How many years ago was this?  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:31):**  It's six years ago, I guess.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:33):**  Before the whole movement really took off.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:35):**  I mean, it was going, but the plant-based milks didn't take over the supermarket yet.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:42):**  So because soybeans have a lot of possibilities to provide products with it.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:49):**  So you can make milk of it, you can make soy sauce of it, you can make tofu of it, lots  
**[0:16:53-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:53):**  of possibilities.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:54):**  And fermentate it.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:55):**  Yeah, we can come back to the fermentation.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:16:58):**  And we also saw a movement that there was a big appetite for ancient grains and gluten-free  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:06):**  grains.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:08):**  So therefore I went into a miller.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:10):**  Can you help me with milling my products and maybe we can connect to some customers?  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:14):**  And that was the connection point where a strange baker visited the miller also.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:21):**  And I said, what you want is not mainstream yet.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:24):**  It's very niche and I don't know it yet, but...  
**[0:17:27-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:27):**  I know someone.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:28):**  Two weeks ago there was also a lunatic who wants to do something with grains and soybeans,  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:33):**  et cetera.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:34):**  Maybe you can call each other.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:35):**  Luckily, you made the connection.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:37):**  Yes.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:38):**  And at this same place where we make also our plans for the whole Soil Heroes company,  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:45):**  that in two hours we decided to go working together and we have a successful brewery  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:49):**  at the moment.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:50):**  And focus purely because the whole soil part wasn't part of the origin story, purely on  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:56):**  taste.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:57):**  That was their quest.  
**[0:17:58-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:58):**  Taste, taste.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:17:59):**  And then they discovered the nutrient part, the soil part, the farmer part.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:02):**  And it highlights something very important.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:04):**  You need a market for your products that buy enough.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:10):**  So you cannot go with your potatoes and your onions to the farmer's market.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:14):**  It needs to buy enough and for a good margin.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:16):**  It's all about scarcity and it's all about decommoditizing your products.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:22):**  Which is a perfect bridge because you've worked for probably eight years in creating these  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:28):**  markets for your products, your physical products that come off the farm, that turn into french  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:33):**  fries, that turn into soy sauce, etc.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:36):**  What was the moment, if you remember, if there was a moment, but that you started thinking,  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:40):**  okay, these ecosystem services, not a nice name, but they sound interesting.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:45):**  Are there other markets that we as farmers that are on this journey, because you have  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:49):**  been on a journey, should explore?  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:51):**  Yes.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:52):**  It's a fact that we all are stuck in a system with commoditized food, where it's all about  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:58):**  the cost price.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:18:59):**  And not about the quality.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:00):**  Not about quality.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:01):**  And not about the taste.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:02):**  Not about the taste.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:03):**  Exactly.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:04):**  And we also depend on the, we are in the highest end of the commodities, but it's still a commodity.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:10):**  So if you want to step out of the system, you have to build business models.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:15):**  So you can focus on the niche markets.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:16):**  We've done with the potato, we've done with soy sauce, etc.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:20):**  But then the niche markets are in development.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:22):**  And if you want to have-  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:23):**  Their niche by definition.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:24):**  Their niche by definition.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:26):**  And it takes seven years to build up a company.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:30):**  So what we learned during our journeys around the world and during our practices for soil  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:36):**  improvement, that if you are changing your mind and you start building soil again, that  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:42):**  you are also going to provide a lot of beautiful things nature give us.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:48):**  So water holding capacity, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, stopping of erosion, now bio  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:55):**  based products, a lot of beautiful things soil can deliver us.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:19:58):**  Which are not food.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:20:00):**  And then just by reading the newspapers, what are the big problems of humanity?  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:20:06):**  We have a carbon problem.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:20:07):**  We have a sweet water problem.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:20:09):**  We have big problems with land degradation.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:20:12):**  We have big problems with erosion, with dust winds, etc. all around the world.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:20:17):**  So I was just thinking on a very easy way, if soil can deliver us such beautiful things,  
**[0:20:25-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:20:25):**  which is called nature, and we can see that there is a big growing, extreme money absorbing  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:20:33):**  problem.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:20:35):**  If we can connect those things, then those services, soil is delivered, what we call  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:20:40):**  ecosystem services now, has value.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:20:44):**  So if we can build a cycle of soil improvement for extreme good food, which you can sell  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:20:50):**  in a vertical supply chain with high nutrients and a beautiful taste, and at the same time  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:20:56):**  you can deliver ecosystem services in the way of water holding, in the way of stopping  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:21:02):**  erosion, in the way of carbon sequestration or biodiversity, that are the four big ones  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:21:07):**  at the moment, and you can sell them, you have extra income as a farmer to invest again  
**[0:21:13-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:21:13):**  in your soils.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:21:15):**  So and then we have a positive spiral upwards.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:21:18):**  Because that's what you mentioned, you came to the realization I need to invest in my  
**[0:21:22-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:21:22):**  soils, but there was no market, there was no marketplace and no money willing to say,  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:21:29):**  okay, Jeroen, great, you're going to store a lot of carbon, store a lot of water, restore  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:21:34):**  a lot of biodiversity, let me pay you for that.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:21:37):**  We're very close to Rotterdam, very close to an enormous harbour that has an enormous  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:21:42):**  environmental footprint, and about eight years ago there was nobody able to say, okay, I  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:21:47):**  can pay you for those services, I can pay you for the beauty, I can pay you for the  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:21:51):**  erosion that's not happening, and you decided to start that market.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:21:56):**  What was that click?  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:21:57):**  Because you could have gone, stayed here on the farm, continued your regenerative practices,  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:22:03):**  waited for somebody else to come and say, okay, I can sit here at the kitchen table  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:22:07):**  and I can be the one selling for you those services.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:22:10):**  What was the switch to the entrepreneur saying, I will…  
**[0:22:14-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:22:14):**  It was a repeating process of voices in my head and in my body and from my heart which  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:22:21):**  were saying, this whole system is possible to realize, we can build soil, we can restore  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:22:28):**  all the degraded farmland in the world by just using very natural practices and then  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:22:34):**  we can deliver such beautiful things.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:22:36):**  Soil is a problem but can be a huge solution and all the dots were continuously connecting  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:22:45):**  in my head and that gave me the evidence and the trust in myself that we can do this and  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:22:51):**  we can help other farmers with such a system.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:22:54):**  So we can empower the farmers, bottom up with a beautiful system that they are stronger  
**[0:22:59-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:22:59):**  in the market and that other farmers can also build business models on their soil.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:05):**  Which is very different from, I can see this opportunity, I know a few of the recipes now,  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:12):**  what works, what doesn't work and I'm just going to expand my farm to 3000 hectares and  
**[0:23:18-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:18):**  be fine.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:19):**  No, I'm going to help other farmers, partner with other farms, empower other farmers, you  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:23):**  just said.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:24):**  Why that empowerment?  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:27):**  Because in the essence, I am a farmer.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:29):**  I'm the son of a farming family and if I drive around, I can see every farmer stuck in the  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:35):**  system.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:36):**  He's not happy in the system.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:38):**  He has to deal with the demands of the retail, etc.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:43):**  And there are such more opportunities for them.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:46):**  And there is a big task of the farmers in the future to restore Mother Earth.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:52):**  And we can do that.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:54):**  So let's do that all together because then the impact is much, much bigger.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:23:57):**  And fortunately, I had the vision of that system in my head that if we can build a system  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:04):**  which can monitor what is happening in the soil and if we can put it through a system  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:09):**  where we can calculate the quantity of ecosystem services, then we are also able to monetize  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:15):**  it.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:16):**  And then we can hopefully start a market.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:18):**  So let's unpack that.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:19):**  What is, I mean, it's a very difficult question.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:21):**  What is the system?  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:22):**  What is Soil Heroes at the moment?  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:24):**  We're talking the middle of 2020 and we'll talk about the vision as well.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:27):**  But what I'm a farmer somewhere in the Netherlands, somewhere in Germany, somewhere in the UK,  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:31):**  somewhere in France.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:32):**  And of course, I love the vision.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:35):**  What could Soil Heroes be to me?  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:36):**  I have 50 hectares and I'm making my first steps, but I would love to go faster.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:42):**  What could Soil Heroes be to me?  
**[0:24:44-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:44):**  Soil Heroes is in the essence a platform where the platform can help a farmer, giving them  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:52):**  access to consumers or buyers, companies or governments or nonprofits, etc., who have  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:24:57):**  the willingness to pay for ecosystem services.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:00):**  And this platform is connecting those two parties on a very open and transparent way  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:06):**  to make a peer-to-peer deal.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:08):**  We can help the farmer with a recipe book, how to accelerate the soil improvement.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:13):**  And then we have a protocol of the steps he has to measure in his soil, starting with  
**[0:25:19-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:19):**  timestamp zero.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:20):**  So it's the beginning.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:22):**  And then he starts farming.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:23):**  We start the whole measuring and monitoring process.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:26):**  All those data is going into our models in our calculation system.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:31):**  And then the quantity of ecosystem services.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:33):**  And we are focusing at this moment on water, biodiversity and carbon.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:38):**  Why dose three?  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:39):**  Because we've done the interview with Nori, which is purely carbon focused.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:45):**  Other people, it seems to be that everybody is going crazy for carbon.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:50):**  Why dose three?  
**[0:25:51-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:51):**  Very good question.  
**[0:25:52-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:25:52):**  If you start improving the quality of soil, if you start building soils, you are not delivering,  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:00):**  you're not only sequestering carbon.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:02):**  You need to improve your biodiversity.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:05):**  You need to improve the water holding capacity.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:07):**  So it's not about carbon only.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:09):**  It's about the whole approach of all the ecosystem services.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:12):**  And there are, I think, 12 or 14 different ecosystem services.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:16):**  You're saying we're only focusing on three, but there are actually another 11 that we  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:20):**  are going to focus on.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:21):**  Yes.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:22):**  And they all have a big value.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:23):**  It's called the natural capital of society.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:27):**  You cannot say, oh, I do only the carbon.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:29):**  You put a machine on your land to suck the carbon.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:32):**  And therefore the whole vision of accelerating the soil improvement, then it's also about  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:38):**  a basket of ecosystem services.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:41):**  So I can, as a customer, sorry, so I'm not the farmer now, farmer, I will come back to  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:46):**  that, but I'm a customer that wants to buy, because I'm buying the basket.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:49):**  I'm not buying the water because I'm a big fan of water.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:52):**  I'm buying the full package.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:26:54):**  Because otherwise you might create incentives for the farmer to only focus on, to more focus  
**[0:27:01-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:01):**  on the biodiversity or more focus on the full package.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:03):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:04):**  So as a farmer, that sounds amazing.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:05):**  You can connect me or you through the Soar Heroes Marketplace, I can connect with buyers.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:12):**  You mentioned the monitoring.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:14):**  So it's not model based, but it's what's really happening in my soils, on my soils, around  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:20):**  my soils.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:21):**  How do you monitor that?  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:23):**  Let's make one thing clear.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:24):**  We are not able to simulate all the things which are happening.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:31):**  We are working with the best universities at the moment to build models of what we think  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:36):**  is happening in the soil and what is measurable.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:40):**  So based on what I can easily, cheaply measure and what we can imagine based on the best  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:47):**  models, again fed by more measurements to figure out, okay, we think we probably are  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:52):**  pretty sure that the biodiversity increased by X and the water capacity.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:56):**  And then the next year you measure again and the models become.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:27:59):**  If we can see an improvement, we are adding ecosystem services.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:28:04):**  And just by calculating the reliability of what we are doing, and that's what we do,  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:28:09):**  we can make it transparent and we say, oh.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:28:11):**  So you're saying this basket has a reliability of 80% and then we sell the 80%.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:28:19):**  So that gives also question to water carbon in the market, which says, how sure are you?  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:28:24):**  So we want to build a very open and transparent system, which is based on trust.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:28:30):**  And by being vulnerable in that, we can make it open and that people are checking it.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:28:37):**  It's also a possibility, it's not anonymous.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:28:40):**  A customer is connected to a farmer and a farmer needs to deliver because the consumer  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:28:45):**  or the company is calculating with the offset of his carbon.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:28:50):**  He is going to use that in his annual report.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:28:53):**  So it's about real things happening.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:28:56):**  It's not paperwork.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:28:57):**  And does that mean there, maybe you're not there yet, but in terms of there's trust,  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:03):**  there's commitment, has to be friendly, obviously to use for the farmer.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:07):**  As a customer, I'm switching back to the customer, when I'm going to buy these baskets, do I  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:12):**  need to put down a long-term commitment?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:14):**  Because I can imagine for the farmer, he or she would like to keep going.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:19):**  Is that a couple of years that I need to like an off-take agreement or can I buy once or  
**[0:29:24-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:24):**  is that still in the process of figuring out?  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:26):**  Because obviously you're building this as we speak.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:29):**  Provision is that there is a lot of compensating your carbon emissions.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:34):**  We strongly believe in a regenerative economy.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:38):**  So building soils again, and therefore we are selling the baskets.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:42):**  And by selling a basket of ecosystem services, you are restoring a certain amount of hectares.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:48):**  And it always comes down to?  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:50):**  To hectares.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:52):**  And for example, the carbon component in it, the carbon part needs to be stored for at  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:57):**  least 10 years.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:29:58):**  But it are annual deals, but we are building long-term relationships.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:04):**  And where are you now in terms of soil heroes?  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:07):**  We're July 2020, as all startups, everything changes every two minutes.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:13):**  What is your current status?  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:16):**  And let's say, then we'll go, what would you like to be at the end of the year?  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:20):**  Yeah, the beautiful thing is that our charcoal drawing, which is made a couple of years ago,  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:25):**  based on a large piece of paper, is still there.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:29):**  It hasn't changed a lot.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:31):**  The core is for 100% still there.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:34):**  At this moment we have built, we have launched an MVP, Minimum Viable Product, where we can  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:39):**  connect an onboard and farmer, where we can connect to a buyer and onboard a buyer, and  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:44):**  do a minimum set of data, do the calculations.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:49):**  And for the basket.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:50):**  Yeah, and do a transaction.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:51):**  For those three ecosystem services.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:54):**  Maybe not for the 14 or 12, but for the three core ones.  
**[0:30:57-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:57):**  The three core ones.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:30:58):**  And that's also one thing what we were focusing on, a basket, because in the end we think  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:31:04):**  if we do this on the right way, the carbon problem is there temporary.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:31:09):**  So if we did it on a large scale, we can solve the carbon problem by doing it all together.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:31:14):**  But in the end, it will be about sweet water and it will be about nutrients.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:31:20):**  Even if the carbon, I mean, I love the argument because even if the carbon problem tomorrow  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:31:25):**  morning would go away, the issue with a lot of the sector of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:31:30):**  and food is that we would sort of lose the only argument we had.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:31:33):**  Like it has to be carbon, carbon, carbon, carbon, carbon.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:31:35):**  But actually carbon is a small part of a much bigger story that if tomorrow carbon disappears  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:31:42):**  as a problem, or disappears as an overflow, because we're filling up the bathtub, it doesn't  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:31:46):**  mean we shouldn't transition away from coal, et cetera.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:31:49):**  But even if that would be fixed tomorrow morning, we'd still be in a lot of trouble on the nutrient  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:31:53):**  side, on the sweet water, drinking water, on healthcare, on a lot of biodiversity, a  
**[0:31:59-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:31:59):**  lot of other things.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:01):**  Starting with biodiversity, biodiversity gave us nutrients.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:03):**  That gave you your biodiversity in your soil, gave your soils back.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:07):**  Yes, that's all about.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:08):**  And carbon is just a side effect.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:11):**  Because it went up, because that was the interesting, you said, I put a lot of compost, didn't change  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:14):**  anything.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:15):**  No.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:16):**  But life back in the soil and you're storing carbon.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:18):**  So that's, I think it's...  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:21):**  Nature is a holistic system with all the small ingredients.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:24):**  And if you put one thing out, there is...  
**[0:32:27-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:27):**  Reductionist thing.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:28):**  Yes, and there is unbalance and it's not working very good anymore.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:31):**  So you're now at the MVP, you're able to connect...  
**[0:32:34-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:34):**  We are beyond MVP at the moment.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:35):**  Like the first customer, the first farmer with the first customer.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:39):**  Is that something that by the end of the year you would love to have a few of those?  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:43):**  We are, at this moment, we want to connect to frontrunners, frontrunner farmers on the  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:49):**  regenerative side.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:50):**  Who have a clear vision, who wants to build soil, who wants to build vertical supply,  
**[0:32:54-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:54):**  they want to build business models.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:32:56):**  Who also wants to be an inspiring source for other farmers.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:01):**  So because what we are doing is not visible on a short term base.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:05):**  On a long term base, it's extremely visible because you see the worms, you can see the  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:09):**  bacteria after that.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:10):**  You can see life in soil.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:11):**  You can see all the insects and the birds, etc.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:13):**  That's on the long term.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:14):**  But on the short term, it's not visible.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:17):**  Therefore we need places where you can be inspired and see.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:20):**  So we want to onboard those farmers.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:23):**  Europe, geography wise, where are you looking for if people want to...  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:27):**  The ambition can be big, but we must be realistic and that we are focusing on Europe at the  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:32):**  moment because we are able to build the models for those soil types, those climate circumstances  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:38):**  and this kind of land use.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:40):**  And it's easy to translate it to Africa or Australia, but it takes time and you need  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:46):**  a team to build it.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:47):**  So first, okay, we start in Europe.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:50):**  So you're looking for a number of front runner farmers and I can manage a number of front  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:53):**  runner companies, buyers, NGOs, non-profits, whatever, whoever wants to buy the baskets.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:33:59):**  Yes, who wants to change their business into a business for goods, purpose driven companies  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:34:05):**  and not profit for a purpose, but profit through purpose.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:34:10):**  And that means you're looking for food companies or in the food space that also want to change  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:34:15):**  their ingredients, change their farm grids, or you're looking for the harbor of Rotterdam  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:34:19):**  that wants to regenerate and not compensate.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:34:23):**  If we want to inspire a bigger community, we are focusing on different sectors.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:34:29):**  It can be fashion, it can be natural cosmetics and home and healthcare, it can be food, but  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:34:36):**  it can be also companies who have a connection with their natural sources from the earth.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:34:42):**  So making a tree of furniture or papers or something like that, who have a connection  
**[0:34:49-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:34:49):**  with soil.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:34:50):**  Launching customers and launching farmers.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:34:52):**  That's the phase you're now in, which is very exciting.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:34:55):**  But it's extremely exciting.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:34:56):**  And in the end, we can hopefully bring back nature to the balance sheet because we have  
**[0:35:02-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:02):**  lost the connection.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:04):**  And it was interesting when you mentioned it's not visible and not tangible.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:09):**  Obviously very different from all the short supply chain work you've done because it was  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:12):**  very tangible because you were making the products from the potato, you are still making  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:17):**  the soy sauce, et cetera.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:19):**  Why?  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:20):**  Because it's not a very sexy subject.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:22):**  Ecosystem services, marketplaces, I mean, just the word already.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:27):**  What convinced you or what triggered you?  
**[0:35:29-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:29):**  I mean, you saw it for your own farm, you see it for others.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:32):**  Why focus on the market of something so intangible or so not visible?  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:37):**  I love to ask the question to see your way of thinking of or to see the ways of thinking  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:41):**  of gas, because I'm very interested in the ITN framework.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:45):**  So the importance, tractability, solvability and neglectedness, meaning this is a very  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:50):**  important problem to you.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:51):**  Like what would happen if we fix this?  
**[0:35:53-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:53):**  Would the world be a lot better or not?  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:55):**  Importance.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:56):**  Is it solvable?  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:57):**  Is it doable?  
**[0:35:58-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:58):**  And can we track that sort of?  
**[0:35:59-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:35:59):**  And is it mostly ignored?  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:01):**  And I think somehow this ecosystem services, at least to me, but obviously you're building  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:06):**  a company in that it ticks all the boxes.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:08):**  Like it's huge if we can pay farmers for, if there's a market, I would love to hear  
**[0:36:12-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:12):**  a bit more on that.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:14):**  It's doable because we see it all around the world that despite all odds, actually farmers  
**[0:36:18-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:18):**  are doing this.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:20):**  And it seems mostly neglected because people talk a lot about carbon.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:23):**  There's some offset, but it's a small market and very opaque.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:26):**  What do you see?  
**[0:36:27-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:27):**  Let's say tackle the most.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:30):**  Do you see that there's a market for these baskets?  
**[0:36:32-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:32):**  Because at the end of the day, it's just like your potatoes.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:35):**  You need to have somebody buying these.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:37):**  We can have all the farmers in the world.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:38):**  I think finding the farmers is not going to be the trickiest part.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:41):**  What needs the market?  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:43):**  It needs the customers to buy these baskets.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:45):**  What has been your experience over the last years there in terms of demand, interest,  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:51):**  understanding of complexity, baskets, thinking?  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:54):**  It's a very long question.  
**[0:36:57-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:57):**  Yes.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:36:58):**  The first thing, is it solvable?  
**[0:37:00-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:00):**  Yes, it's solvable.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:01):**  We can solve a lot of problems and we can solve...  
**[0:37:03-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:03):**  We don't have a food problem.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:05):**  We have a nutrient problem and we have a distribution problem.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:10):**  It's already proven that we can grow very healthy food in the desert.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:14):**  If the world population is growing so fast, we are still able to feed them.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:18):**  Maybe we have to eat a little bit less meat because a lot of the crops which we're growing  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:23):**  at the moment is for cattle feed.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:27):**  That problem is done.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:28):**  Doesn't mean it's easy.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:29):**  Turning a round of farm in this current system anywhere in the world is difficult, but it's  
**[0:37:35-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:35):**  possible.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:36):**  It's possible.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:37):**  Okay.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:38):**  So importance.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:39):**  Is it important?  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:40):**  We've talked about that.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:41):**  It's fundamental even if we take out the carbon part.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:43):**  Is it neglected?  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:44):**  Are a lot of people focusing and working on this?  
**[0:37:48-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:48):**  Not yet, but you see, if you look at the awareness of the last two years in all the news at the  
**[0:37:55-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:37:55):**  moment about biodiversity, for example, about very good research papers that biodiversity  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:03):**  must be part of the business models, others are wise.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:05):**  We don't have a produce anymore in the future.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:08):**  So it's not a nice to have.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:10):**  It's an absolutely key to have.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:11):**  It's a key to have.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:12):**  If you don't have biodiversity above and in your soil.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:15):**  We are all connected.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:16):**  It all starts with nature from the earth.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:19):**  And if we as a collective decide to continue destroying it, that's also a decision, but  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:26):**  then we know it's going to end somewhere in the future.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:31):**  And there is a growing group of consumers and companies who feel and see the vision  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:37):**  that we have to do something back for all the things we took from the earth to restore  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:43):**  and make the whole economic systems more in balance.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:48):**  And they see that also as a new way, a new license to produce for the future.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:38:54):**  Meaning that to answer the question of there is interest, there is potential demand, there  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:39:00):**  is the demand side of this basket of ecosystem services, not just I want carbon, I want water.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:39:06):**  You see a change over the last year since you've been diving very deep into this, obviously.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:39:13):**  It's the front runners where we are focusing on at this moment, but they see that they  
**[0:39:18-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:39:18):**  can bind their community of their buyers by doing good, by doing something back, by implementing  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:39:26):**  it in their whole business model, by being carbon or planet neutral or maybe planet positive.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:39:32):**  And if you see the other movement in the true cost accounting, which we totally have forgotten  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:39:37):**  in the last 20 years, it's still there.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:39:41):**  It's a common problem.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:39:45):**  And there is a growing group also of activists and shareholders and investors who are going  
**[0:39:49-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:39:49):**  to ask questions.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:39:51):**  The public media is going to ask questions and we need to prepare ourselves as companies,  
**[0:39:56-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:39:56):**  as consumers to have the answers for that.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:39:59):**  And there is a big opportunity in those markets.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:02):**  And if you calculate the value of this market, it's huge, but we're still in the beginning.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:06):**  So we have to imagine if we are five years further on the road, what's happening then?  
**[0:40:11-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:11):**  What would happen then in your vision five years down the line?  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:14):**  So 25?  
**[0:40:15-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:15):**  It would be normal to talk about bringing back nature on your balance sheet.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:22):**  And it can be an asset.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:23):**  So it's because it has a value, then you can put it on the balance sheet and it's not out  
**[0:40:27-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:27):**  of pocket money anymore.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:28):**  It's not a nice to have.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:29):**  It's a key to have.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:30):**  Especially, I mean, I always say, especially in food, but actually in food, fiber, oils,  
**[0:40:35-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:35):**  every fashion, almost everything we wear, eat, breathe comes out of the soil, either  
**[0:40:41-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:41):**  very deep or slightly more up.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:44):**  And we completely lost that connection.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:47):**  And there's also a social imbalance.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:49):**  And you're solving that problem also.  
**[0:40:54-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:54):**  And so you're in that process.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:40:56):**  So if we would talk in a year from now, like say 12 months later, we'll probably be able  
**[0:41:01-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:01):**  to talk about a number of these deals.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:03):**  The first front runner farmers connected to the first front runner companies, brands,  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:08):**  et cetera.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:09):**  And we'll be seeing some of those exciting ones.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:11):**  We'll definitely check in.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:12):**  We have more data then.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:14):**  And therefore we also have the Soil Heroes Foundation, which is run by Melanie, that  
**[0:41:18-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:18):**  we can tell what has happened on those farms.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:22):**  We can tell the deals we've made.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:25):**  And hopefully that's a big source of inspiration that this new industry, nature inclusive industry  
**[0:41:34-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:34):**  is going to evolve.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:35):**  And now we're talking about big.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:37):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no big picture.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:39):**  But I think if we're such at the beginning, if we don't dream big, then yeah, we're,  
**[0:41:45-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:45):**  we're doomed anyway.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:47):**  So to end with a few questions that I like to ask in general, and I know you have some  
**[0:41:50-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:50):**  thoughts about this.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:52):**  So you're for now, let's say for a few years, no longer the co-founder of Soil Heroes.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:41:57):**  They run by themselves, but you're in charge of a $1 billion investment fund and you come  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:02):**  a bit from the world of investing.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:03):**  So I'm expecting some interesting answers.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:05):**  What would you, how would you put that money to work?  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:09):**  What we see is that transition finance is a hot topic at the moment because you have  
**[0:42:15-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:15):**  to help farmers to go through the starting phase because there is a little bit unawareness.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:22):**  Things go wrong.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:23):**  The market is not there fully, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:25):**  You have to build soils a little bit first before you can deliver the ecosystem service.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:30):**  So there is a startup phase in building soil.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:34):**  So there are, if we can run a $1 billion farm investment fund, I said, there could be-  
**[0:42:41-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:41):**  Could be farmland.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:42):**  There could be anything else.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:43):**  If you want to invest in oil and soy sauce, that's also possible.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:46):**  There are a few big gaps at the moment where we can focus on.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:50):**  It's about spreading your risk also, but it's not one thing.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:53):**  It's about, you can invest in the real assets, in degraded farmland, restoring it, make it  
**[0:42:59-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:42:59):**  available for farmers to grow or expand their farms.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:02):**  It's a very good thing to invest in.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:05):**  And it's a big problem also.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:07):**  The other thing is we can help accelerating the ecosystem service market by investing  
**[0:43:13-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:13):**  in soil impact bonds.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:16):**  So it's a performance agreement that you are going to deliver those amount of ecosystem  
**[0:43:21-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:21):**  service, but you get paid in advance.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:24):**  That's also a way of transitioning finance for the farmers.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:27):**  But that means, because they're not there yet, you probably would invest in actually  
**[0:43:32-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:32):**  setting up the first outcome-based payment scheme to make sure that market-  
**[0:43:36-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:36):**  That's not so complicated.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:37):**  But still, it's not that you can decide tomorrow, okay, I have 200 million, I want to invest  
**[0:43:42-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:42):**  them all in these outcome-based products because they're not there yet.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:45):**  You have to develop them, but it's an investment.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:48):**  If you have an investment fund, it's about building business models also, because then  
**[0:43:54-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:54):**  the value of your money is going to increase.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:43:56):**  The other thing is just helping them with transition loans in a very creative way.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:44:01):**  I have my vision about it, not just a normal loan, but it can be a very creative one that  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:44:06):**  you have that your noses are in the same direction, not from a banking perspective.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:44:12):**  Partnering with farmers, skin in the game.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:44:15):**  And the fourth big thing is we have a food system at the moment, but by helping companies  
**[0:44:23-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:44:23):**  who want to build a different way of making food, and therefore they need the products  
**[0:44:32-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:44:32):**  from the land, it's an extremely interesting growing area where it's about nutrients in  
**[0:44:38-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:44:38):**  the end, where it's about taste in the end, and related to what's happening at the moment  
**[0:44:45-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:44:45):**  where we have a food system where we fill the people and not feed the people, and that  
**[0:44:50-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:44:50):**  market opportunity is huge.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:44:53):**  By building those rather small vertical supply chains, it's-  
**[0:44:59-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:44:59):**  Which is interesting because you have quite a bit of experience with that, and most of  
**[0:45:03-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:03):**  them didn't work out that well.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:05):**  But a few did, so you would definitely invest in more.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:09):**  Some of that investment fund would be put into, let's say, the next generation food  
**[0:45:14-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:14):**  companies that are building food as medicine, nutrient density, because let's say the taste  
**[0:45:20-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:20):**  of the soy sauce is asking for more of those.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:22):**  Are there any products, not products, but let's say, oh, I would love for, you said,  
**[0:45:30-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:30):**  this is a product category I would focus on.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:32):**  Would it be grains?  
**[0:45:33-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:33):**  Would it be potatoes?  
**[0:45:35-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:35):**  Would it be livestock?  
**[0:45:37-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:37):**  Is there anything that if somebody would be building a company, it all has to be rebuilt.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:42):**  But at this moment, what excites you?  
**[0:45:44-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:44):**  What excites me at the most at this moment is the crops a farmer needs to grow to improve  
**[0:45:50-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:50):**  the quality of soil, but which have the lowest profitability.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:54):**  It's not the first time this comes on the podcast.  
**[0:45:57-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:57):**  That's very interesting.  
**[0:45:58-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:45:59):**  So basically buying the whole rotation, but not the cash crop.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:01):**  How can you-  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:03):**  For example, now from we are growing wheat, but we are not earning money on it because  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:06):**  we need the wheat to increase the quality of soil.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:10):**  So it's a rest crop.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:12):**  It's an investment.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:13):**  It's a loss.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:14):**  It's only costly money.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:16):**  If we can make this crop more profitable by connecting it to very interesting business  
**[0:46:22-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:22):**  models, then we are not depending anymore on those very big cash crops, which are extremely  
**[0:46:30-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:30):**  negative intensity for the soil.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:34):**  And it's all about balancing.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:36):**  Figuring out how to make sure you can sell the full rotation and all the crops that normally  
**[0:46:42-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:42):**  I would either would go to animal feed or would just be cut in and plowed into the soil.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:47):**  So if we can grow a super grain, which has the highest nutrient content and that you  
**[0:46:52-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:52):**  can recover very quickly after because the proteins are so good after a hospital visit  
**[0:46:58-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:46:58):**  or something, well, maybe it's so good that you don't need to go to the hospital anymore  
**[0:47:02-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:02):**  in the end.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:04):**  Okay.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:05):**  So we take your investor head away, unfortunately, but you have the magic power to change one  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:10):**  thing in the agriculture and food system industry overnight.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:14):**  So there's one, if one thing you would change, would it be everybody has a nutrient density  
**[0:47:19-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:19):**  meter?  
**[0:47:20-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:20):**  Would it be everybody's focused on taste or all farmers are counting rainworms?  
**[0:47:25-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:25):**  What would be your magic?  
**[0:47:26-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:26):**  You have one shot.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:27):**  Don't ask for two, but what is your one shot?  
**[0:47:29-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:29):**  If we have a nutrient passport with all the food we are growing and providing.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:34):**  We meaning the farmer or the consumer or as society?  
**[0:47:37-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:37):**  As a society.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:39):**  Because that brings us the awareness.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:41):**  And then in the end, we all know that the health care costs are rising enormously fast.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:46):**  And at the end, it will be all about nutrients.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:49):**  When did you realize that?  
**[0:47:53-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:53):**  That's not such a long period ago.  
**[0:47:56-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:56):**  It's about-  
**[0:47:57-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:57):**  It's a process.  
**[0:47:58-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:58):**  It's a process.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:47:59):**  It's just reading a book, talking to people who are busy on this.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:04):**  For example, Dan Barber, who has a vision about the connection between taste and nutrients.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:11):**  It's also about growing some ancient grains and see that they won't become sick.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:17):**  So there has been an evolution of the seed where the seeds are not so strong anymore  
**[0:48:22-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:22):**  that they can protect themselves against fungi and bacteria.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:27):**  And when you look at ancient grains of 600, 700 years ago, they are still green on the  
**[0:48:32-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:32):**  field.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:33):**  And what excites you about that?  
**[0:48:35-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:35):**  Because the yield is a lot lower, but it's a whole different framework.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:39):**  That nature had the possibility-  
**[0:48:41-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:41):**  To grow a grain that doesn't get sick.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:43):**  And we lost that.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:45):**  And just to bring it full circle, I mentioned at the intro a fair model, a fair chain model  
**[0:48:52-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:52):**  of what you're building with Soar Heroes.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:54):**  What is fair about the model?  
**[0:48:58-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:58):**  And why that specifically?  
**[0:48:59-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:48:59):**  Because you very consciously put that in the slogan.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:49:02):**  The fairness is that it's open and transparent.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:49:05):**  Which is something that the agriculture world is not.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:49:08):**  So you want to decommodify an ecosystem service market.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:49:12):**  Also, you have a peer-to-peer deal and we are only-  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:49:15):**  We are a service company to that, just for a fee.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:49:20):**  And so the market is going to develop and the farmers get paid for it.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:49:24):**  And by building a short supply chain in the niche market, you are able to divide your  
**[0:49:30-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:49:30):**  food dollar or euro in your supply chain on an equal basis.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:49:36):**  So because I strongly believe if you have a system of a farmer, which is very talented  
**[0:49:42-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:49:42):**  in growing foods, then you have a processor and a marketeer.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:49:45):**  And if you can work together in your own talented to build this supply chain from farmer to  
**[0:49:52-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:49:52):**  consumer and you decide, oh, it depends on each other's talent, we can also share each  
**[0:49:58-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:49:58):**  food and euro dollar on a fair way.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:01):**  Instead of the brands taking most of the- or the supermarkets, yeah.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:05):**  And if there would be one thing you believe to be true about agriculture or regenerative  
**[0:50:11-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:11):**  agriculture as well that others don't, what would that be?  
**[0:50:14-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:14):**  This question is definitely inspired by John Kemp, who usually asks it in a slightly different  
**[0:50:17-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:17):**  way.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:18):**  What do you believe?  
**[0:50:19-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:19):**  I have an idea, but what do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that  
**[0:50:23-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:23):**  others don't?  
**[0:50:24-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:24):**  I strongly believe that it is working.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:27):**  It's a system in balance which is working and which is improving itself.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:32):**  And by answering that, you are saying that most people still don't or don't believe that  
**[0:50:38-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:38):**  it's possible and working?  
**[0:50:40-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:40):**  There is a big hesitance because we are in a world where we have been grown up and educated  
**[0:50:47-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:47):**  in a more industrialized, cost price driven way of farming.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:52):**  Even when you bring your neighbors, other farmers to your farm, you show what has changed,  
**[0:50:58-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:50:58):**  what is happening because you can show it very nicely as you have some fields that have  
**[0:51:00-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:51:00):**  been in this transition for eight years, some recently joined the family and are much shorter.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:51:06):**  It's still difficult to see because you can touch, you can feel, you can taste.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:51:10):**  And there is always between, if you have two mountains and there is a big valley in between,  
**[0:51:17-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:51:17):**  you have to have the guts to step from this side to the other side.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:51:23):**  And there is a lot of social influence around that, influence of the whole industry around  
**[0:51:29-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:51:29):**  us.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:51:31):**  And you are saying that paying for ecosystem services, however unsexy that might sound,  
**[0:51:37-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:51:37):**  could help more farmers to take that jump.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:51:40):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:51:41):**  Because in the end, if you are getting empowered, bottom up, with extra money, extra business  
**[0:51:49-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:51:49):**  moles, extra income, every farmer wants to have an extra income and they are all working  
**[0:51:54-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:51:54):**  with the biggest assets, that soil.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:51:57):**  And you don't want to spoil that.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:00):**  You don't want to destroy that.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:02):**  But you are forced to do that because you are in a cost price system.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:05):**  Every farmer wants to step out.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:08):**  But is blocked so far, most of them.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:09):**  Yes.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:10):**  And that can be by banks, it can be by your long term contracts, it can be by all.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:15):**  Agronomists.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:16):**  Yes.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:17):**  Your neighbors.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:18):**  Yes.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:19):**  With that, I don't think we could wish for a better end of the interview.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:23):**  Thank you so much, Joon.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:24):**  I don't think it's the last time we'll be talking about this.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:26):**  I'm looking forward and I wish you all good luck of closing the first, or enabling the  
**[0:52:32-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:32):**  first contracts to flow through the system and the first money to flow to the farmers  
**[0:52:38-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:38):**  and first baskets to flow the other side.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:40):**  We have signed the first contracts this week, so we are very happy and looking forward in  
**[0:52:45-0:52:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:52:45):**  a positive way to the next six months.

**[0:53:42-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:53:42):**  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, how to put money to work in regenerating

**[0:53:50-0:53:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:53:50):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:53:52-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:53:52):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:53:56-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:53:56):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:54:01-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:54:01):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:54:43-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:54:43):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:54:46):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:54:49-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:54:49):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:54:59-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:54:59):**  No.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:00):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:02):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:55:07-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:07):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:12):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:55:17-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:17):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:20):**  Thank you.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:21):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:55:22-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:22):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:55:29-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:29):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:30):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:55:35-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:35):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:55:41-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:41):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:55:46-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:46):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:47):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:55:52-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:52):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:55:56):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:56:01):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:56:02-0:56:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:56:02):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/11/jeroen-klompe/#t=0:56:04):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.

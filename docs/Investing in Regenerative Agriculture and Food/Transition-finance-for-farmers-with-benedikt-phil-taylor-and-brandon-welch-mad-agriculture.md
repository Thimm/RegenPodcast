**[0:00:13-0:00:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:00:13):**  What does it mean to truly partner with a farmer to provide a fair and skin in the game  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:00:18):**  transition finance investment in her or his farm to help the farm speed up their regenerative  
**[0:00:23-0:00:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:00:23):**  journey?  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:00:24):**  To answer that question we go deep into the why, the how and the what of mad agriculture  
**[0:00:29-0:00:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:00:29):**  and the perennial fund.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:00:30):**  So take a cup of tea or a cup of coffee and enjoy this long episode with Phil, Brandon  
**[0:00:35-0:00:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:00:35):**  and of course my co-host and partner in crime, Benedict.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:00:49):**  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:00:52):**  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:00:56):**  Why are we recording this series?  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:00:58):**  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:01):**  They have looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the gurus on their  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:06):**  farms, explored farm size regenerative designs and most importantly started their pilots  
**[0:01:11-0:01:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:11):**  and feedback loops.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:12):**  This is where transition finance is key.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:14):**  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of flexibility  
**[0:01:20-0:01:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:20):**  and the farmers lack of collateral.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:22):**  Furthermore there is a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give away.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:28):**  That is why my co-host aspiring to be regenerative farmer Benedict Beuzel and I are embarking  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:33):**  on a journey to find out what are the key principles of transition finance for regenerative  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:39):**  farmers.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:40):**  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative agriculture and food finance  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:45):**  space.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:46):**  They share their insights how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative transition  
**[0:01:50-0:01:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:50):**  on Benedict's 1000 hectares which is almost 2500 acres farm in Germany close to Berlin.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:57):**  This is an open process.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:01:58):**  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:02):**  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:04):**  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other inspiration, people  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:10):**  to interview etc.

**[0:02:21-0:02:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:21):**  Welcome to another episode of the transition finance series where me and my co-host Benedict  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:25):**  are interviewing the key thinkers and doers in terms of transition finance.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:30):**  And today we're very excited, I can say we because I know Benedict is as well, to have  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:34):**  Phil and Brendan of Mad Agriculture and the Perennial Fund on the podcast.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:39):**  And I don't want to take any time away from that.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:41):**  So let's get going immediately.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:42):**  Hi, Phil and Brendan.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:43):**  Welcome.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:44):**  Hey, thanks for having us on.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:45):**  Thanks for having us.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:46):**  It's great to be here.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:48):**  And of course, welcome Benedict, my partner in crime in this series.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:51):**  Yes.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:52):**  Hi, guys.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:53):**  It's awesome to meet you and to hear you.  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:02:54):**  I'm incredibly excited to hear how you arrived at this place, what we were thinking and obviously  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:00):**  telling us a bit about your approach and talk us through some of the steps that you follow  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:04):**  through with the farmers.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:06):**  And I think, you know, not putting up the pressure too high, but you're obviously at  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:09):**  the very forefront of changing the paradigm of thinking about financing agriculture.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:14):**  As of my thinking, you know, one of the big situations as of today is that the debt structures  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:19):**  are overwhelmingly high and that obviously makes people and farmers stuck in the system.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:24):**  And I mean, this is what we have to get out of.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:25):**  So amazing to have you guys.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:27):**  So let's let's have you share the good shit.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:30):**  No pressure, but the listeners cannot see that.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:32):**  But we can see on the video that the sweat slowly starting to emerge from Phil and Brendan  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:37):**  to all this pressure that we're putting on them.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:39):**  No, I'm kidding.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:40):**  I'm kidding.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:41):**  Please.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:42):**  Can you give for anybody that doesn't know that thinks mad agriculture that sounds mad?  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:46):**  What is it?  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:47):**  What's the group?  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:48):**  What's the bit of the backstory?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:49):**  And I will definitely link to some resources, obviously, below a bit of the origin story  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:53):**  there.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:55):**  So mad agriculture is inspired by Wendell Berry's mad farmer poems.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:03:59):**  And Wendell Berry is sort of a great agrarian of our time that wrote a series of poems in  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:04:05):**  the 70s called the Mad Farmer Poems, which call us to a radical reformation of economy  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:04:10):**  based on a set of virtues that we often don't see guiding our current financial economy,  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:04:17):**  our current commerce and those virtues, our love, reciprocity, compassion and a good dose  
**[0:04:22-0:04:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:04:22):**  of radicalism.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:04:24):**  And so we are wholly inspired by Wendell and his work and really stand on the shoulders  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:04:30):**  of his wisdom, among many others, in various wisdom traditions.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:04:36):**  And the madness comes from this really this feeling that the world that I believe in,  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:04:41):**  and that we believe in, is so different than the one that exists that everything we do  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:04:47):**  is touched with a sense of madness and insanity.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:04:50):**  And so we really embody that spirit in the way that we work.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:04:54):**  We're very bold about it.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:04:55):**  And I would say that the emergence of mad agriculture comes from two different lines.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:05:00):**  One is my own journey in life.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:05:02):**  My wife and I founded this two years ago, which was the culmination of many different  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:05:08):**  journeys in life are just profoundly interesting.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:05:11):**  A lot of cyclical light, dark cycles and self discovery.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:05:15):**  And when you're full of passion and zeal and you want to manifest something important in  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:05:21):**  the world, it can take a long time to find that.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:05:24):**  And my wife and I went through a really exciting and challenging journey to through academia  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:05:31):**  and many different dimensions of life where I was like, wow, this is really hard.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:05:36):**  And what happened was, is we realized we really needed to ground into our heart and listen  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:05:42):**  to that wild essence inside of us and listen to this, not only the song of ourselves, but  
**[0:05:48-0:05:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:05:48):**  the song of the universe that's calling for a new and more beautiful and just paradigm  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:05:55):**  to come into being.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:05:56):**  And so the madness, while it's our work, it's also the work of the world.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:01):**  And I think what's so beautiful about it is that the organization attracts people organically  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:07):**  because it feels true.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:08):**  It feels righteous in the best sense of the word.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:11):**  It feels bold, ambitious.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:14):**  And I think that that's our essence.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:15):**  It's our core is revolution.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:17):**  And I'm working in academia for many years, which I really I have a Ph.D. in soil biogeochemistry.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:24):**  I really loved and appreciated my time traveling the world, studying the way the world works.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:29):**  But I wasn't able to freely break the categories needed to create whole change.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:33):**  So how do we pull on poetry and science, head, heart, soul, all the spiritual dimensions,  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:39):**  those lineages, the elders?  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:41):**  How do we bring it all into a manifestation that feels real?  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:47):**  It feels unknown.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:49):**  It feels exciting.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:51):**  It's challenging.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:53):**  And we're just possessed with this.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:56):**  And it's really fun.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:06:57):**  So Mad Agriculture is very much about creating whole system revolution by breaking those  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:02):**  categories open in a way that's very open and excited about the future, not one that's  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:08):**  full of fear and doom and gloom, but potentiality and the power of life that come back.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:15):**  And when humans work with nature and not against it, which is a very lofty ambition, given  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:20):**  the paradigm we've been working in the last 10,000, 20,000 years, when we can start to  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:26):**  tilt the systems into that kind of working with really powerful things can happen.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:30):**  Yeah, that's that's our essence.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:32):**  I can tell you a longer story, but that's the core.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:35):**  Thank you so much.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:36):**  Actually, you touched upon many, many different things we're going to unpack, but also the  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:41):**  story of how I mean, it attracts organically people that are interested in this.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:45):**  And Brandon, could you because I know the background story and actually podcasts play  
**[0:07:49-0:07:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:49):**  an important role in that.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:50):**  How did you end up in Mad and how did you start working with the Mad group?  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:54):**  Yeah, that's a good question.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:07:56):**  It was a winding road and to make a very long story.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:01):**  You're not that old.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:02):**  Come on.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:03):**  Essentially, I grew up in Massachusetts, went to Vermont, went to UVM, went to school there  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:09):**  studying mechanical engineering.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:11):**  It was a little too mechanical, rigid.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:15):**  There wasn't really any room for creativity when you're in Calc three and magnetism, physics  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:20):**  and all of those classes that just didn't seem to, it didn't seem to grab me.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:25):**  So I ended up actually going on a long hike called the long trail through Vermont took  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:30):**  me three weeks with a couple of buddies and along that hike, I just realized I realized  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:35):**  something was missing with just connecting with nature, with being outdoors, with how  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:40):**  I was living my life.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:42):**  And I went back to school that next semester, ended up switching to environmental science  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:47):**  with really no plan.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:48):**  Just wanted to focus on that realm, specifically looking at climate change and environmental  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:53):**  degradation.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:08:54):**  So graduated with that degree, then went on long bike ride, had planned to move to Portland,  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:01):**  Oregon, but I had met my partner right before I left.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:05):**  So I ended up living in Vermont for another year, worked in a water quality testing lab  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:09):**  doing organic volatiles testing for the EPA.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:13):**  Also pretty rigid and didn't allow for any expansiveness.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:16):**  It was just running samples all day.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:19):**  So wanted to get out and figure out just find something new.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:23):**  So my girlfriend and I hopped in the car about a year later.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:27):**  This was in 2016.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:29):**  Went on a big road trip across the US for three months, looking for a new place to live.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:34):**  We weren't really sure where that was going to be.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:37):**  I actually started a podcast myself along the way in order to just learn and listen  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:42):**  to people and just find an easy excuse to talk to people that I was interested in learning  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:46):**  from.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:47):**  So I actually met a guy named Brad here in Boulder, Brad Smith, who had started this  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:52):**  cool EV program.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:53):**  He was the first person I spoke with.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:09:56):**  And then about two months later after I had interviewed him, he ended up sending an internship  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:01):**  opportunity my way to work with a group called Natural Capitalism Solutions.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:06):**  I ended up interning there and then managing a nonprofit called the Colorado Carbon Fund.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:12):**  That is a local carbon offset fund focused around the state of Colorado and investing  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:17):**  in local carbon removal projects.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:20):**  And some of the inefficiencies of carbon markets, they're pretty early.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:24):**  They are very expensive.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:26):**  They take a long time to get up and running.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:28):**  There's a whole host of issues in the world.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:32):**  And I met Phil as he was starting to talk about carbon farming.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:37):**  He was starting Mad Agriculture and it had just begun with a gathering of carbon farming  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:42):**  series with local farmers and practitioners and people who are interested in learning  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:47):**  about carbon farming at the local grain shawl that we have up here in Longmont.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:51):**  So I think it just started with a coffee.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:53):**  And then from there, Phil's magnetic.  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:57):**  He pulled me in.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:10:58):**  I learned about regenerative ag, its potential to remove CO2.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:01):**  And I thought, let's just focus on this of growing good food, helping people get healthy  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:07):**  food into their body, helping farmers make more money, helping sequester CO2, let's improve  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:12):**  water quality, biodiversity.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:14):**  It just seemed like such a better place to focus my energy than carbon markets, which  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:19):**  are kind of external and on the outside of the system versus something at more of a foundational  
**[0:11:26-0:11:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:26):**  level.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:27):**  So, you know, worked for a long time, just kind of exploring the whole landscape of the  
**[0:11:32-0:11:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:32):**  food value chain and the food system with Phil.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:35):**  You know, we were going out to California, meeting all the usual suspects out there,  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:40):**  driving through Kansas, Nebraska, meeting farmers, bankers, you know, people in the  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:44):**  various aspects of the supply chain.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:47):**  And then we landed on our model of change from there.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:49):**  And then we were able to get some donations into the nonprofit and Phil hired me and now  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:55):**  we're here a couple of years later.  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:11:58):**  Well, it's such an incredible story to hear both of your individual backgrounds.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:03):**  And I mean, it's so fascinating how the straight lines never seem to lead to what your real,  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:09):**  you know, I guess task is in life.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:11):**  And having had those different experiences, having, you know, the good ones as well as  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:15):**  the bad ones and shaping your sort of idea and perspective on what it is you want to  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:19):**  contribute, I think it's so incredibly important to have those.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:24):**  And this relates so much to that new way of thinking about farming, I think, because I  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:31):**  just spoke to someone today and we were talking about basically why the hell would I decide  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:37):**  to start a journey on a road on which I'm basically just observing and adapting, observing  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:43):**  and adapting.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:44):**  And there's no end to this and there's no, let's say, like he said, so when are you ready?  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:50):**  I was like, I'm not going to, like, you can't get ready.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:54):**  It's a complex ecosystem.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:55):**  It's a journey, it's an approach.  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:56):**  And he's like, well, so what's the motivation?  
**[0:12:58-0:13:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:12:58):**  I said, what's the motivation?  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:00):**  This is what life is about.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:02):**  I love what I'm doing.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:04):**  This is where I get all my joy from.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:06):**  I have problems, I try to solve them.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:09):**  I have disappointments.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:11):**  Some things work out especially well, but this is what shapes me.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:14):**  This is what brings the energy to my life.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:16):**  This is what brings the energy that draws other people to come here because there is  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:20):**  real life happening.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:21):**  It's the complexity, it's the luck, it's the joy, it's the downfall as well.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:26):**  And I think this is often when you look at the classical, let's say old way farming,  
**[0:13:32-0:13:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:32):**  what is lacking?  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:33):**  We have to start telling the positive stories.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:36):**  We have to tell how much joy it brings, how much the complexity of ecosystems brings that  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:42):**  quality and that color and the body to your life.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:46):**  Whereas today it's very much about how much you per hectare.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:49):**  We're not allowed to use this and that.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:51):**  The consumers want this and want that, but they don't know what the reality is.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:54):**  And instead of putting your energy in some things that are difficult to change, like  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:13:58):**  it's not raining enough, use it for something that you love, that you live in, that you  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:02):**  can build.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:03):**  And I think that is more on a psychological level, but it's fundamentally important because  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:08):**  as a farmer you live farming.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:10):**  It's not a job, it's your life.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:13):**  So you ought to look after using your energy and the inputs on what makes it worthwhile  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:19):**  doing.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:20):**  So yeah, just a little excuse, but it's so fundamentally important and such a huge part  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:24):**  of it.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:25):**  It's a big piece of where we start with any farmer.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:28):**  Before we do anything about talking around markets or finance or community or any of  
**[0:14:33-0:14:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:33):**  these things, we always work with the farmer to really understand their essence and their  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:40):**  value system.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:41):**  And we have a series of frameworks that we use in order to reveal that so that we create  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:46):**  a shared understanding of the value system that's driving their relationship to the land.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:52):**  And then that allows us to more deeply co-create and empower the farmer in their place because  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:14:57):**  it's very easy for a farm planner to come in and say, hey, you should do all this stuff.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:01):**  Then you leave and you're done and then nothing happens.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:04):**  See what you have to do is we have you get in and you empower and you inspire what's  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:09):**  already living within them.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:10):**  You sort of allow them, I think you've used the phrase before, allow them to dream, right?  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:14):**  That's one of the questions you asked, like what can you possibly imagine here?  
**[0:15:19-0:15:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:19):**  What would you love?  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:20):**  What do you dream about?  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:21):**  That's right.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:22):**  We try to create the conditions that unshackle whatever's holding them back and give them  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:27):**  permission to imagine and act.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:30):**  And many, many cases, they're so unfamiliar and don't even have the psychological tools  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:36):**  to go there because they've been working in a scarcity mentality for so long.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:41):**  There's actually significant trauma that we use unrealized across the entire farming.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:48):**  I mean, the entire rural commodity economy has been colonized, whether they acknowledge  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:53):**  it or not.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:54):**  They've been as the entire middle of America is in a welfare state on the farm bill and  
**[0:15:59-0:16:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:15:59):**  it's so unhealthy.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:00):**  The entire thing has been extracted by the corporate behemoth that's extracted the soil,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:06):**  the heart and soul, the value of the entire economy.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:10):**  It's very difficult to see outside of that system and know how to change.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:15):**  The Perennial Fund was designed in order to liberate farmers out of the traditional financing  
**[0:16:21-0:16:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:21):**  systems and give them permission to dream big and go for it.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:24):**  And that's really, we can get to the Perennial Fund in a minute, but what we do is we start  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:29):**  with the farmer.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:30):**  There's a series of three concentric circles.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:32):**  The middle circle that we always work on first is the farmer and the value system, their  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:37):**  essence.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:38):**  Not only the essence of the farmer, but of the whole decision making team.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:41):**  And so Alan Sabre would call this the holistic context.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:44):**  What's the vision of the farmer?  
**[0:16:45-0:16:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:45):**  What's the conditions?  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:46):**  What's the sacredness, the sense of stewardship and belonging?  
**[0:16:50-0:16:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:50):**  Most farmers aren't there to turn a dollar and make money.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:52):**  They're there because of heritage, of other reasons due to their long history, intergenerational  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:16:58):**  immigration and all of that is wrapped up in the story.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:01):**  And so we asked them what story you come from and what story do you want to create?  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:06):**  And after we do that significant grounding...  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:08):**  How do you do that?  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:09):**  You sit down at the kitchen table, have a lot of coffee and spend hours on this, I'm  
**[0:17:14-0:17:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:14):**  imagining.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:15):**  Well, sometimes it's implicitly, sometimes it's explicitly.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:18):**  And that's where we sense, we have to be careful in our sensing.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:21):**  With someone that might be far more on the conservative end of the spectrum and their  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:24):**  fresh relationship to us, it might be several meetings where we build trust.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:29):**  And we have story after story where I'll be in the middle of Nebraska in a truck and the  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:34):**  farmer will literally pull over on the side of the road as we're scanning their fields.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:38):**  The farmer has clearly voted for Trump, I've clearly not voted for Trump.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:42):**  And the farmer says, my goodness, I shouldn't agree with everything you're saying, but I  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:46):**  agree with everything you're saying.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:48):**  How can we be friends?  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:49):**  I mean, these are real conversations.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:51):**  And when you start having that softening across the polarizations that typically divide us,  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:17:57):**  you know that you're getting somewhere on that deeper human level of shared beliefs.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:02):**  And many people call this the radical center.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:05):**  And that's where we like to operate around shared human values, which are far more common  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:09):**  than our differences.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:10):**  And so we have human strategies and approaches that we use to do that.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:17):**  And sometimes it's explicit.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:18):**  Like if we work with a group of fellows in a workshop, we have a series of frameworks.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:22):**  A lot of it's inspired by a mix of the best TED talks we can find.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:27):**  And then a lot of the work from Carol Sanford, the regenerative life and her work.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:32):**  She's been an amazing elder in the regenerative movement and has provided a lot of frameworks  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:37):**  that we've adapted and used to help farmers sense themselves and guide that visioning  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:43):**  process.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:44):**  And so, yeah, it's interesting because people immediately, well, this isn't scalable, but  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:48):**  it's entirely scalable.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:50):**  It's called human change at the grassroots level.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:52):**  It's called community.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:55):**  And that's where real durable change happens.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:18:57):**  And we have to trust that, even though it doesn't sometimes feel like a big policy win  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:02):**  or feel like a big title shift that you can see.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:05):**  It's happening, it's happening quick.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:07):**  And so I think, going back to our framework of change, we start with the farmer deeply.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:14):**  And then we consider in the next concentric circle the farm itself.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:17):**  And so we use seven of the 10 scales of permanence.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:20):**  It's a PA Yeomans, Regrarians adaptation where we systematically work through things that  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:27):**  the farmer cannot change about their operation to the things that the farmer can change,  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:31):**  has more influence over.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:33):**  So we start with climate and then we talk about water and geography, landform, infrastructure,  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:39):**  the tools and equipment they have, the plants and the animals they work with, the balance  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:43):**  of wild and cultivated spaces, and then the soil.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:47):**  And so we work systematically through those lenses of the farm and we slow down.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:51):**  Because a farmer might want to immediately talk about markets because that's where they  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:55):**  think the solution is.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:19:56):**  But if we don't slow down and acknowledge and inspect where the strengths and weaknesses  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:01):**  are in each of those lenses, sometimes we miss where they really have strength to make,  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:07):**  they already have strength in their corner or a weakness that everything hinges upon.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:13):**  And so we use that scale.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:14):**  And then the third concentric ring outside the farmer, then the farm itself, is then  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:20):**  how does the farm interact with the world at large?  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:23):**  And there are three or four dimensions in which it interacts with the world.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:27):**  The first is who is your community of change?  
**[0:20:30-0:20:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:30):**  Who are you surrounding yourself with?  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:32):**  Now who you surround yourself with is who you become.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:35):**  And so you've got to be very careful about where you source and curate wisdom, who you  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:38):**  lean on, who you laugh with, cry with, who you read poetry with, what YouTube channels  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:44):**  you participate in or Instagram feeds you follow.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:47):**  All of that matter.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:48):**  It's real.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:49):**  And then that community of practice really can span the kind of grassroots level stuff  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:55):**  all the way to the policy stuff.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:56):**  So we kind of hold that whole dimension.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:20:58):**  The second lever of change that really can influence how a farm interacts with the world  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:03):**  is what capital they source from.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:05):**  Not all farms need money.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:07):**  We can talk about that.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:08):**  But many farms do.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:11):**  And many farms lean on an annual operating loan.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:13):**  And so what we do is we design farms that take full advantage of whatever public dollars  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:19):**  are available for the farmer, which often they have trouble getting access to because  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:23):**  it's number 10 on their to-do list.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:26):**  And then the other thing we do is we design farms that access new sorts of private money.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:31):**  We went out looking for innovative working capital and operating capital.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:35):**  We found none.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:36):**  And so Brandon led the creation of the Perennial Fund, which is an alternative bank for farmers  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:42):**  to transition to organic using regenerative practices.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:45):**  So the farm is now interacting with the community.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:48):**  It's interacting with capital.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:49):**  And then the third big dimension is the markets.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:53):**  How do you get paid for your products?  
**[0:21:55-0:21:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:55):**  Your animals, the plants you're working with?  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:57):**  What's your business model?  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:21:59):**  We really work hard to decommoditize the crop.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:01):**  We believe there should be full transparency soil to shelf.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:05):**  Value systems need to be fully articulated.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:08):**  Right now, the supply chains that wrap the world hide injustice all too well.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:14):**  And we've got to resolve that.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:15):**  And so we really work on reimagining supply sheds.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:20):**  We do that on two parts.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:21):**  We work on behalf of the farmer to decommoditize and find new locations for their crops.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:26):**  And then we also work with brands to revamp their supply chains back down to the soil.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:31):**  So last point, and I'll finish my monologue, is we also work to help farmers get paid for  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:40):**  building public good.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:42):**  And in this case, we're starting with helping them get paid for sequestering carbon and  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:46):**  soil.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:47):**  We've worked really closely with Nori pretty recently, the fresh carbon drawdown marketplace.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:54):**  And we're really in the deep end with them on measuring, monitoring soil carbon, using  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:22:59):**  kind of the latest, coolest, greatest things out there.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:02):**  It's a big challenge.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:03):**  But I would say that I'm highly cautious about commoditizing nature and do not like the term  
**[0:23:09-0:23:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:09):**  ecosystem services at all.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:10):**  It's a very utilitarian.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:11):**  I don't think anybody likes it in this space, to be honest.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:16):**  So we're just calling it public good.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:17):**  We do believe that farmers should be valued for the whole wealth that they're creating.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:23):**  And how do we do that?  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:25):**  And so for me, Regen Network and what Soil Heroes is working on and what Nori is working  
**[0:23:31-0:23:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:31):**  on are sort of the gold standards from a philosophical grounding that supports these kinds of virtues  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:39):**  that I'm hoping become more part of the current world.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:43):**  So that's kind of our general framework of working, we have all kinds of theories of  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:47):**  change that actually underpin that sort of general model.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:51):**  But that's how we work with every farmer.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:54):**  And it takes a process, it's a human relationship.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:23:57):**  We don't come on the farm trying to peddle chemicals or this or that.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:01):**  We show up and build authentic relationships rooted in trust.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:05):**  And a sense of shared destiny is critical.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:08):**  I spent tons of time in academia, all around the world overlaying my white man imperial  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:14):**  ideas over all kinds of interesting people with the best intentions.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:19):**  But it was completely, it didn't work practically.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:23):**  And then I think it missed the whole point of being human, which is crafting a shared  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:29):**  sense of a healthy, vibrant future together.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:32):**  I will link some of the interviews below.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:33):**  Actually, we had Paul of Nori on the podcast.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:36):**  We're going to have Jeroen of SoHero soon and also Regen Network completely at the beginning.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:40):**  I have to do a check-in interview with them.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:42):**  But I think one of the earliest talks with them on that, but I will definitely link them  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:46):**  below.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:47):**  Thanks.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:48):**  Getting a bit sort of on the actual, let's say management questions and production ideas.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:54):**  What would be sort of after the phase where you get to know, build the relationship, get  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:24:58):**  a shared sort of vision once you basically look into each other's eyes and say, okay,  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:04):**  let's do this.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:05):**  What is the first step?  
**[0:25:06-0:25:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:06):**  Obviously, you probably analyzed sort of the background, but how is that first tipping  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:13):**  the toe in the change as in on the field?  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:16):**  How does that happen?  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:17):**  Where do you start?  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:18):**  And what's the sort of communication or reaction that you have come across?  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:22):**  The key is to start small and find an early win.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:26):**  We really believe that taking risk is not easy for a farmer.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:30):**  Even with how robust the systems that currently prevail are, we've got to be really careful  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:36):**  in how we disrupt them.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:38):**  And the change has to be attuned to their appetite for change.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:44):**  And so we do a lot of work.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:46):**  For instance, I'll give you an example.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:48):**  We have a farm that we work with.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:49):**  It's a broad acre farm, 376 acres, two pivots swirling.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:54):**  They typically grow alfalfa for organic dairy.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:25:58):**  And organic dairy is a confined feedlot kind of dairy.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:03):**  So it's not the pinnacle of organic production.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:07):**  And they want to reimagine how that farm is used.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:11):**  And so we still have one pivot completely on alfalfa.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:16):**  That's sort of their breadwinner, their anchor, their foundation.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:18):**  But the other pivot now, it has Kernza on it.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:21):**  It has a perennial sandphoene.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:23):**  Just for the list, what is Kernza and what's the other one you mentioned?  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:26):**  Okay, yeah, I'll start back up.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:29):**  Kernza and sandphoene are both crop innovations coming out of the Land Institute in Salina,  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:35):**  Kansas.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:36):**  The Land Institute has long been the thought leader around how do we perennialize agriculture.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:41):**  10,000 years ago or more, humans made an interesting decision to work with annual-based plants.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:47):**  And annual-based plants, it makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:50):**  They have all of their nutrition in their seed heads.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:53):**  And so to harvest the seeds and eat them is really nutritious and it's a great way to  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:58):**  feed ourselves.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:26:59):**  And so as we domesticated plants to work with, we favored annual plants.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:04):**  The big downside of annuals is that you have to get into the field and you have to till  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:08):**  the soil every year.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:10):**  And you're basically running your system in a state of emergency year after year after  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:13):**  year.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:15):**  And you're basically working with primary succession in an ecosystem.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:20):**  And if you know anything about primary succession in ecosystem, it's where invasives come,  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:24):**  it's where weeds feel the most happy.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:26):**  It opens up all of the space for invasion.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:29):**  It's really difficult to manage, it requires tons of tools, it requires tons of inputs,  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:34):**  it requires pesticides for management.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:36):**  So all of these things that we bemoan about our current industrial system are a product  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:41):**  of our early relationship with annual plants.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:44):**  And so one of the ambitions of the Land Institute and many others now around the world is to  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:49):**  create a perennial agriculture where you never have to go in and disrupt until you're creating  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:54):**  perennial polycultures that you can still harvest with the best of technologies.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:27:59):**  So it's not going back, it's kind of going back looking for lost virtue while reimagining  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:28:04):**  a new system with the best of human innovation.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:28:07):**  It's a nice little marriage of a lot of different ideas and philosophies.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:28:12):**  So the Sanfoy and Kernza perennial wheatgrass are really front edge kind of leading ideas.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:28:20):**  And we have local markets within a couple hours of this farm where we can directly place  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:28:25):**  these kinds of things into.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:28:26):**  We have several different mills that are popping up.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:28:29):**  These bills will pay a premium dollar for these things, they can capture that margin  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:28:33):**  to their direct consumer pricing.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:28:36):**  And so we've been working on annual, basically perennializing part of it, working on annual  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:28:42):**  grains on another part of it, and then working on hemp on the other part for seed actually,  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:28:48):**  not for CBD.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:28:49):**  And so it's taking a traditional farm that is ready for some change and being very cautious  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:28:56):**  about how we create the change and lining up early wins where it's like, oh, we can  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:29:01):**  sell this wheat per pound at least 50 cents, if not a dollar per pound.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:29:07):**  And when you can sell it at that rate, the farmer is going to pencil out favorably for  
**[0:29:11-0:29:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:29:11):**  the farmer.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:29:12):**  Because right now, for instance, wheat, wheat's four and a half cents a pound on the open  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:29:16):**  market, which is unbelievably low.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:29:19):**  And when you can sell it, you can sell a wheat directly for human consumption in a local  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:29:24):**  market for 50 cents a pound or a dollar a pound, your economics, your net profitability  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:29:30):**  goes way up, even if the yield is like four or five times lower.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:29:34):**  You know, on these heritage ancient grains that are land race varieties, you can take  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:29:40):**  a huge yield hit and be far less extractive on the soil and require far less inputs and  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:29:45):**  still pencil out within that profitability of two or three X.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:29:50):**  That's an example of how we will work with a farmer and use our full wealth of connections.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:29:55):**  That's why we don't just do farm planning.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:29:58):**  We do farm planning with cognizance of market, farm planning with cognizance of capital,  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:30:03):**  farm planning with cognizance of community, so that we can bring that whole system of  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:30:07):**  change to bear when we work with a farmer.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:30:11):**  It's really critical to not, you know, we've been told for generations that do one thing  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:30:17):**  and do one thing well, specialize, reduce, be reductionistic.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:30:21):**  And for Madag, our secret sauce is being generous and being a community and just being free  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:30:28):**  flow with all the dimensions of humanity.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:30:31):**  I mean, it's so much fun.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:30:33):**  And it's where all the good work happens.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:30:35):**  And I'm just thinking it's definitely where all the fun happens and the interesting people  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:30:40):**  are and I mean, they find you as well.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:30:44):**  And then because he said the connection to capital and you didn't find anything, you  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:30:48):**  decided to set it up yourself, which is, I mean, I think many people imagine, okay, I  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:30:53):**  wish there would be a bank for transition finance and I wish, but then going from that  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:30:57):**  wish doing that, it's an enormous step.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:02):**  Can you share a bit about the journey?  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:05):**  How did that happen?  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:06):**  Where are you now?  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:07):**  We'll get into that.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:08):**  But how did that happen?  
**[0:31:09-0:31:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:09):**  Like when was the first time you said, okay, I wish there was a perennial fund.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:12):**  And then somebody probably said, oh, let's build one as a joke.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:15):**  I can imagine over a few beers, maybe on a Friday afternoon, but how did that happen?  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:20):**  Both Brendan and Phil actually, because you were both there.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:23):**  Maybe even just share a lot really quickly on the concept itself so that if some of the  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:27):**  listeners don't know it yet, that you just have an idea which direction it is going that  
**[0:31:31-0:31:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:31):**  would be great.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:33):**  Unlike any startup, I think we thought it was going to be easier than it's been.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:38):**  It's taken a lot of effort and a lot of learnings to get it to where it is now.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:43):**  The idea had initially come about, it was early 2019.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:48):**  Phil and I were just sitting in a boardroom at a previous coworking space.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:54):**  We were, I think it was a Friday, we were about to go into the weekend and we were just  
**[0:31:59-0:32:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:31:59):**  kind of spit balling ideas of where is help needed and how can we create something that  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:32:06):**  would actually make sense for farmers to transition to organic specifically.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:32:11):**  Because through 2018, we had come across the obvious organic premium, especially in grains  
**[0:32:18-0:32:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:32:18):**  where it's two to four X.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:32:20):**  We had learned the difficulties that it takes for farmers to get there, experiencing T yields  
**[0:32:25-0:32:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:32:25):**  at conventional prices, which usually result in the loss of profitability through the transition.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:32:32):**  And we didn't find any banks willing to lend on profitable land.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:32:37):**  So just to unpack that a bit, that means that the period of a farmer when he or she goes  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:32:40):**  for certified organic, obviously in this case, we're talking regenerative organic, maybe  
**[0:32:45-0:32:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:32:45):**  not certified regenerative organic, but not the feedlot organic you mentioned before.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:32:48):**  So don't be scared.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:32:49):**  Listen, we're talking about regenerative agriculture here, but we're going for certified organic  
**[0:32:52-0:32:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:32:52):**  because of the premium and there is that three year period where you're being paid for basically  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:32:59):**  as you were still extractive agriculture, which you're not, but obviously you're making  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:03):**  the investments and you have, if depending on how bad your soil has been treated, you're  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:07):**  taking quite a yield hit, meaning that you're losing money for a number of years.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:11):**  And you were looking around, is anybody willing to fund that gap basically?  
**[0:33:16-0:33:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:16):**  Exactly.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:18):**  And the gap kept coming up again and again and we weren't finding anybody that was funding  
**[0:33:23-0:33:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:23):**  it.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:24):**  Would you imagine that somebody would do that?  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:25):**  I mean, there's a ready market after there's a two, three, four X you mentioned even in  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:29):**  terms of price of grains.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:30):**  And if you get your, I mean, I hear the best regenerative grain guys and girls are almost  
**[0:33:36-0:33:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:36):**  at par with the best grain ones for way lower costs.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:39):**  So in terms of profitability, margins, et cetera, et cetera, makes a lot of sense, but  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:43):**  you have a gap, but nobody was willing, no bank would say, Oh, that actually sounds very  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:47):**  interesting.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:48):**  Exactly.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:50):**  It just kept coming up again and again.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:51):**  We thought, well, obviously there's a hole here, so let's fill it and let's create something  
**[0:33:57-0:34:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:33:57):**  that will work for farmers to effectively transition to organic.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:00):**  So I think we immediately, we were like, let's put a stake in the ground.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:04):**  We went and we came up with the name pretty much on the spot.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:08):**  We went and bought the domain.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:09):**  And now that we had a website, it was official.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:11):**  So we had to do it.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:13):**  So over the course of the next six months, it was a lot of backend research.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:19):**  So writing a huge white paper, just analyzing different regions throughout.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:24):**  Which is amazing by the way.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:25):**  I still like it.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:26):**  I know you're not super happy with it, but I really like it.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:29):**  I'll update it in time.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:32):**  Those were early days.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:33):**  I feel like we've learned quite a bit since then, but yeah, we basically analyze Minnesota,  
**[0:34:38-0:34:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:38):**  Nebraska, and then Iowa looking at the profitability of organics, the market opportunities, the  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:47):**  banks that were there willing to loan or not willing to loan, the amount of farms and just  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:52):**  did a full bore landscape analysis of what is the state of organics and conventional  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:34:57):**  and farms that are trying to transition to organic.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:35:01):**  And through that, that really shed the light on a lot of holes in the system beyond just,  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:35:07):**  okay, it's hard to find a loan to effectively to transition to organic, but the financial  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:35:13):**  system is just also not working for farmers right now.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:35:16):**  If a bank gives a loan and they don't get their principal plus interest, they're coming  
**[0:35:21-0:35:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:35:21):**  after the farmer's land, they're coming after their tractor, their house, everything that  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:35:25):**  they have securitized.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:35:26):**  It didn't seem as though there was actually really being risk for the bank tied to the  
**[0:35:32-0:35:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:35:32):**  risk that the farmer was taking.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:35:34):**  The bank was essentially, and they still are not taking risk.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:35:38):**  They're backed by the RMA, they're backed by the FSA, they're backed by these large  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:35:42):**  institutions that say, if you give out loans in these specific niches in basically corn  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:35:48):**  and beans using GMOs and glyphosate, we'll make sure that you're made whole even if the  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:35:53):**  farmer is not able to service their debt.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:35:56):**  So none of these banks are taking any risk on their loans basically?  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:00):**  They're basically not taking any risk.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:02):**  So to just couple that with this idea of transitioning to organic, we thought we would start thinking  
**[0:36:08-0:36:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:08):**  of some radical financial ideas.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:10):**  Because none of these banks are going to do that, obviously, because they already make  
**[0:36:13-0:36:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:13):**  very easy money in the extractive space.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:16):**  Why would they bother with these weird transition guys and movements?  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:20):**  And I had a profit margins down the line, but why would I bother?  
**[0:36:24-0:36:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:24):**  So nobody would move if they don't have to.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:26):**  The annual banking cycle, the annual operating loan is really locked in, and that's what  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:32):**  bankers from community banks are familiar with, that's what farmers are familiar with.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:37):**  So disrupting that system, it's foreign, it's unusual.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:42):**  So I think that we just need to wholly reimagine the relationship of the way the public invests  
**[0:36:51-0:36:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:51):**  and helps with farmers.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:52):**  I mean, we just have to reimagine it.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:54):**  The power is completely out of the farmer's hand.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:36:57):**  And I feel like with the markets and the financial system where they are, and the lack of ability  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:37:04):**  to control the cost of inputs and the value of the crop, the farmer is pinched from every  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:37:10):**  possible mechanism into this one type of production system.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:37:16):**  And it's completely constrained their ability to do what they want.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:37:20):**  And so I think back to what Brandon was saying, we wanted to create a farm finance that was  
**[0:37:26-0:37:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:37:26):**  truly in the trenches, so to speak, with the farmer, where we truly share risk and co-journey  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:37:34):**  and live with the farmer so that if they fail, we fail, if they win, we win.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:37:40):**  And so there's a complete skin in the game approach where over that transition period  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:37:45):**  and payback, we're with the farmer, we're providing them technical assistance, market  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:37:50):**  connections, capital.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:37:53):**  Like the whole thing comes with the capital.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:37:55):**  I mean, what capital comes with, dare I say, wisdom?  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:37:59):**  I mean, once you get that money from the bank, you better show up at the end of the year  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:03):**  with interest and pay it back.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:05):**  For us, it's about, okay, let's lend money very strategically to the farmer for what  
**[0:38:10-0:38:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:10):**  they need and let's live with them through the entire process of generating the revenues  
**[0:38:16-0:38:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:16):**  to pay it back.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:17):**  But I'll let Brandon talk a little bit more about the revenue-based financing that I think  
**[0:38:21-0:38:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:21):**  is really important because Gen 1 regenerative finance was all asset acquisitions, it was  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:27):**  real estate plays, it was safe, it was secure, wonderful organizations, SLM and Iroquois  
**[0:38:32-0:38:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:32):**  Valley, Farmland, Dirt, great people.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:35):**  Interviewed them all, yeah.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:36):**  Great people and awesome ideas.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:39):**  There's just not enough innovation in working capital and operating capital.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:43):**  In other areas, there's been awesome financial innovation like in the social impact zone  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:47):**  and around fair trade coffee and in solar financing.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:51):**  But in agriculture, operating and working capital is just untouched.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:55):**  There's an awesome group, Zach Deschanel from the Intertribal Agricultural Council is working  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:38:59):**  on some fantastic stuff that I just got to know.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:03):**  Robbo has an-  
**[0:39:04-0:39:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:04):**  Please share, I want to interview them.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:05):**  Robbo with Pipeline.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:06):**  Yeah, Robbo with Pipeline and that's about it.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:11):**  Carbon yields.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:12):**  Yeah, carbon yields.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:13):**  Sam, but it's not public yet.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:15):**  That's about it.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:16):**  Now that's my great frustration.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:17):**  Where are all the other people?  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:19):**  Please get in touch if you're listening this and you think I should be on that list.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:23):**  But where are the other people thinking about working finance, transition finance and not  
**[0:39:28-0:39:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:28):**  buying the land?  
**[0:39:29-0:39:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:29):**  Yeah, we really like the idea.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:31):**  I mean, there are two big questions that always come up for me, which is what does the land  
**[0:39:36-0:39:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:36):**  want to be?  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:38):**  That's very difficult to reconcile our production systems with, right?  
**[0:39:43-0:39:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:43):**  Asking that question is a big one.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:44):**  That's like a multi-decadal century level kind of question to answer.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:49):**  What does the land want to be and how do we live in reciprocity with it?  
**[0:39:52-0:39:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:52):**  The second is, is colonization, land ownership and all of that, particularly where we are.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:39:59):**  We are white settlers in a foreign land.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:03):**  Everything around us in Colorado and beyond is the product of genocide and trampling over  
**[0:40:08-0:40:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:08):**  indigenous peoples.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:10):**  When we talk about funds, owning land, that's a heavy, heavy, heavy issue to wrangle with  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:17):**  morally.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:18):**  I think we need to crack open our current conceptions of ownership.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:24):**  Like the Agrarian Trust is doing fantastic work in this area.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:27):**  We don't have to get there now because I don't actually have a very sophisticated solution  
**[0:40:31-0:40:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:31):**  or understanding of it.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:33):**  I just know that it's big and we need to go there.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:36):**  Yeah, I mean, for sure.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:38):**  In line with that, if you ask me, is actually a discussion we have to have about the definition  
**[0:40:44-0:40:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:44):**  of capital.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:45):**  What are we talking about?  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:47):**  Monetary capital or is it soil capital?  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:50):**  Is it eco capital?  
**[0:40:51-0:40:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:51):**  Is it social capital?  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:52):**  I mean, there's so much of what we are already addressing in the model that we use the land  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:40:58):**  and work with the land.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:00):**  These are values.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:01):**  These are values that we can measure without a doubt and where we can monetize them.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:06):**  In the realm of thinking about investment and return, on what values, on which capital  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:12):**  are we basing this?  
**[0:41:13-0:41:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:13):**  If we do save the soil, build the soil, if we clean the water, then that's capital.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:19):**  We have to find ways of monetizing that and going the way that you are going, I think,  
**[0:41:24-0:41:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:24):**  from a financial institution's point of view is obviously a tough thing to do because they  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:29):**  are so stuck in their system that obviously they will have difficulties basically getting  
**[0:41:33-0:41:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:33):**  into that realm of thinking differently.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:35):**  But there is some hard facts that we can use in the discussion and they can be used as  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:40):**  a banker just to give you an understanding.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:43):**  If we, for example, in Germany or I guess anywhere, if you do maintenance of your machines  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:49):**  or you care for the machines, you do the service on the machines, that is a value to the machine.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:55):**  So the hypothetical value of your machine is going up.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:41:59):**  If we use cover crops instead of taking some mechanical process to kill the weed, then  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:42:06):**  that's just basically our cost.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:42:08):**  It has no value effect on the soil, although it is basically more or less the same thing.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:42:12):**  So there is actually accountable, measurable numbers and ways of calculating that kind  
**[0:42:19-0:42:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:42:19):**  of capital that as of today is basically ignored.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:42:22):**  So there is different entry points that we can actually use.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:42:25):**  So it would be interesting to hear if you have some regard of that sort of capital.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:42:30):**  For instance, if you speak to one farmer compared to the other, if you see, well, there is so  
**[0:42:34-0:42:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:42:34):**  much basically social maybe on an educational side or bringing kids in or whatever that  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:42:40):**  makes him stand out compared to maybe someone else, you say, well, because he is thinking  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:42:45):**  in this way or that way, we actually want to support him even more so.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:42:49):**  Although maybe on a sort of estimated timeframe until getting into the fun zone, so to say,  
**[0:42:55-0:42:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:42:55):**  it might take a bit longer.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:42:56):**  Is that something you guys can take account of?  
**[0:42:58-0:43:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:42:58):**  Yeah, there is a great, one of the frameworks that we use, Gregory Landois and Ethan Solovey  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:43:05):**  from Howgood wrote the eight forms of capital and early paper in regenerative ag.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:43:10):**  I thought that was really profound sort of constellation of capital understanding and  
**[0:43:15-0:43:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:43:15):**  asking the question, what do we over serve and what do we underserve?  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:43:20):**  The paper dollar is the one that we over serve and the ones we underserve are things like  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:43:25):**  ritual and sacredness.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:43:27):**  I think just going to regenerative ag, we often talk about regenerative ag being the  
**[0:43:32-0:43:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:43:32):**  use of these tools and techniques, but for me it is something far beyond that.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:43:36):**  The use of those tools and techniques toward a vision that creates ritual and reciprocity  
**[0:43:42-0:43:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:43:42):**  with seed and place and the sense of terroir and beauty and long living and right living  
**[0:43:49-0:43:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:43:49):**  together.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:43:50):**  I don't think we talk about that enough in the regenerative paradigm about what we are  
**[0:43:53-0:44:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:43:53):**  moving toward and I think that the eight forms of capital that you were mentioning, Benedict,  
**[0:44:00-0:44:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:00):**  are all wrapped up in that ultimate expression.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:02):**  We have been tampering with that.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:06):**  In the current system that we are trying to disrupt, the paper dollar rules the roost  
**[0:44:11-0:44:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:11):**  and that is what everything, all of our pro formas and everything live and run and die  
**[0:44:15-0:44:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:15):**  by, yet underneath that whether measured or unmeasured is all of that kind of deeper,  
**[0:44:22-0:44:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:22):**  juicier human stuff.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:24):**  We don't have currently a framework for measuring that impact.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:29):**  And non-human stuff.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:30):**  Yeah, and non-human stuff, exactly.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:33):**  Great question.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:34):**  It provokes me to think about a little bit how we analyze the creation of all forms of  
**[0:44:40-0:44:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:40):**  capital in the systems that we finance.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:43):**  We have been currently thinking about how do we, if regenerative ag is both financially  
**[0:44:49-0:44:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:49):**  more profitable and ecologically more profitable, how do we go about measuring that and how  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:44:55):**  do we go about tracking that progress and success over time with kind of a constellation  
**[0:45:01-0:45:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:45:01):**  of metrics, quantitative and qualitative, that really showcase the overall creation  
**[0:45:09-0:45:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:45:09):**  of a better system.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:45:11):**  And it takes a lot of resources to do that well.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:45:14):**  And I think where being a startup non-profit, we don't have all of the expertise and staff  
**[0:45:20-0:45:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:45:20):**  to really go for it.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:45:21):**  But I think you are hitting on something important that I think we are actively talking about  
**[0:45:26-0:45:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:45:26):**  as a piece of the perennial fund is how do we track and monitor and tell the story of  
**[0:45:32-0:45:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:45:32):**  change.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:45:33):**  And we have been working with Farmer's Footprint a little bit about preparing sort of how are  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:45:38):**  we going to showcase a number of these farmers as they transition because particularly around  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:45:43):**  how we think of our theory of change is farmers listen to farmers foremost.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:45:48):**  And if you can have shared experience and eureka moments between farms, it creates pockets  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:45:55):**  of change.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:45:56):**  And if you look at organic adoption, for instance, you will find there is a social factor underlying  
**[0:46:02-0:46:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:02):**  the adoption.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:03):**  And that is very, very true of any kind of agricultural adoption.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:07):**  Particularly any adoption if you look at solar panels, if you look at different garden, I  
**[0:46:12-0:46:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:12):**  mean anything we look at each other and we look at neighbors if they are depends how  
**[0:46:16-0:46:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:16):**  big the fences, how far they are, but we look at each other.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:19):**  Yeah, there's something careful in there from a kind of diffusion of technology.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:23):**  It also keeps you locked, obviously, if you don't have any neighbor going then.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:27):**  That's right.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:28):**  Yeah, there's we find that from like the first movers perspective that a lot of folks that  
**[0:46:33-0:46:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:33):**  are first movers are often iconoclastic and rebellious and actually put a lot of their  
**[0:46:38-0:46:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:38):**  neighbors away.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:39):**  But after maybe a decade worth of work and or even more as they attract what we think  
**[0:46:46-0:46:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:46):**  are like first adopters or early adopters.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:49):**  They're better spreaders.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:50):**  Yeah, then you have people that are part of a social fabric.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:53):**  There's a we're being strategic in who we fund.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:56):**  They're more accessible.  
**[0:46:57-0:46:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:57):**  So you fund the second group, if I'm correct.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:46:59):**  Yeah, you would fund the second group, but I also think that you there are first movers  
**[0:47:05-0:47:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:05):**  that are transitioning.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:06):**  They're starting to attract others.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:08):**  They're starting to attract the early adopters.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:10):**  And so I think from our perspective in the Perennial Fund, what we're looking for are  
**[0:47:15-0:47:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:15):**  lead farmers that will become beacons of change in those communities so that when we expand  
**[0:47:20-0:47:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:20):**  in the PF2 that those become that nexus point in which we can attract, create field days,  
**[0:47:27-0:47:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:27):**  have barbecues, basically live and journey together.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:30):**  A key piece of the Perennial Fund is that all the Perennial Fund farmers will be a community  
**[0:47:35-0:47:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:35):**  of change.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:36):**  You know, there's gonna be quarterly meetings on Zoom and we'll be talking about successes  
**[0:47:39-0:47:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:39):**  and failures.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:40):**  And it's going to be a shared experience where we grow together.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:45):**  And that's just it's critical to have that kind of human social fabric of change for  
**[0:47:49-0:47:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:49):**  a variety of reasons.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:52):**  And then beyond that, another interesting piece is that we're actually going to have  
**[0:47:55-0:48:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:47:55):**  yearly field days where the investors themselves, which are typically black box behind the fund  
**[0:48:01-0:48:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:01):**  or behind the bank or behind a pension, you have no idea where that money's coming from  
**[0:48:05-0:48:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:05):**  and where it's going.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:06):**  Our investors are actually, our LPs are going to be meeting with all of our farmers every  
**[0:48:11-0:48:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:11):**  year to actually put a face behind these loans, behind the land, behind what's transitioning,  
**[0:48:16-0:48:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:16):**  what's being grown and showing that resources and capital come in many different forms.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:23):**  And sure, an investor has the paper dollar, the thing that we value or society is valuing  
**[0:48:28-0:48:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:28):**  most right now.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:30):**  But farmers have the ability to grow food and that is just as important.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:34):**  Which we're valuing a lot actually in this crisis.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:36):**  We're recording this in May, end of May 2020.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:39):**  While still a lot of people are struggling to find food.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:42):**  Do you want to talk a little bit about the revenue based kind of payback?  
**[0:48:47-0:48:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:47):**  Yeah, I should probably do.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:48):**  Or Benedict, do you have a question first?  
**[0:48:50-0:48:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:50):**  No, I mean, I was actually just, you know, we talked about sort of social capital and  
**[0:48:56-0:49:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:48:56):**  that whole universe of value that is being added, you know, as this thing about it would  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:01):**  be amazing to be able to measure energy.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:05):**  Because this is, I think, what happens.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:06):**  You create this incredible energy from which so much then sort of leads to the next and  
**[0:49:11-0:49:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:11):**  this happens and this happens.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:13):**  And you probably can.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:14):**  I think this is what draws people in.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:16):**  You can probably measure like your farm visit day, like how excited are people?  
**[0:49:21-0:49:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:21):**  Like some kind, are they leaning in or not?  
**[0:49:24-0:49:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:24):**  The level of voice they use.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:26):**  Somehow you can probably measure excitement.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:28):**  We often call it a happiness project.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:31):**  I was just going to say, we have to create like a gross national happiness index for  
**[0:49:35-0:49:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:35):**  farming.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:36):**  Do you know what I mean?  
**[0:49:37-0:49:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:37):**  Like this would be just, you know, the best thing.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:40):**  You know, it's so fascinating.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:41):**  And I think this is another kind of imperial lens on how we view the world is there is  
**[0:49:45-0:49:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:45):**  a happiness index that's around.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:47):**  And you know, I think like outliers are like Burma and Costa Rica are surprisingly happy  
**[0:49:53-0:49:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:53):**  given their economic development status.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:49:55):**  You know, and it's conditioned completely around wealth creation.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:00):**  And that's like, so we just have to reformulate the index and always be cognizant that quantitative  
**[0:50:06-0:50:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:06):**  measures often fail to capture the essence.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:09):**  They are important.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:10):**  By definition, they're reductionist.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:12):**  By definition, they're reductionistic, no matter how complicated the index and how many  
**[0:50:17-0:50:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:17):**  things you aggregate in the expression or the number.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:21):**  But it does raise the question.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:22):**  I mean, for us, we're actually our ultimate goal is to work toward beauty and happiness  
**[0:50:27-0:50:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:27):**  and joy.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:28):**  And as you touched on earlier, this idea that like you are curious, your life, your energy,  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:34):**  your color comes from your exploration of how to belong and live with the land.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:39):**  Like that is beautiful.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:41):**  And I think that that is whether a farmer is in that manifestation mode and full consciousness  
**[0:50:46-0:50:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:46):**  or not, that's in there.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:49):**  Whether they have the language tools to express that, often they don't.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:54):**  Often it's much more rudimentary.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:56):**  It could just be a slap on the back or a smile, but it's there.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:50:59):**  That same essence is there.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:01):**  And I think that we're playing with that.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:03):**  We're playing with happiness.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:05):**  And that's the core of all of these complicated solutions and everything is it's about how  
**[0:51:10-0:51:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:10):**  do we create happy people on the land that are deeply considering what it means to belong  
**[0:51:15-0:51:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:15):**  here.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:16):**  It's so fascinating to hear what you guys basically experience and the way you think  
**[0:51:20-0:51:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:20):**  and the way you talk about it, because it's just, you know, I relate to so many of the  
**[0:51:25-0:51:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:25):**  things.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:26):**  It's basically, it's interesting how from very different places on the earth and coming  
**[0:51:30-0:51:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:30):**  from very different experiences and doing very different things, we all see and feel  
**[0:51:34-0:51:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:34):**  and it's fascinating.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:36):**  And I think that is why I am so incredibly positive with regards to the future, because  
**[0:51:42-0:51:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:42):**  I mean, there is this huge, amazingly active, aware group of young people, the Friday for  
**[0:51:48-0:51:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:48):**  Future generation, so to say, they are more aware than we have ever been.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:52):**  And they will bring so much energy now to this table and they will make sure that we  
**[0:51:57-0:51:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:57):**  do change.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:51:58):**  And the fascinating thing and Kun you know this from Jan Gistfeld as well, once you have  
**[0:52:03-0:52:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:52:03):**  realized the potential and you see the beauty and the love and the holistic thinking, it  
**[0:52:11-0:52:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:52:11):**  will never lose you.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:52:12):**  I have never met someone that has actually, you know, grasped it, has sort of, you know,  
**[0:52:16-0:52:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:52:16):**  even if they've been a bit critic, they had some time, they had some interest, they asked  
**[0:52:21-0:52:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:52:21):**  you again, they came to visit again, but if they did, you know, take it in.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:52:26):**  It changed, everything changed, you know, and this is, I think, what we're going to  
**[0:52:30-0:52:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:52:30):**  see in the next couple of years.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:52:31):**  And so I'm just, you know, I'm incredibly hopeful and positive about the whole future  
**[0:52:36-0:52:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:52:36):**  of land use and on that level, on the whole idea of economic systems and that that comes  
**[0:52:41-0:52:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:52:41):**  in, you know, how do we think about capital, the money system, obviously it's not going  
**[0:52:45-0:52:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:52:45):**  to change tomorrow, but there's huge changes in front of us, I think.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:52:48):**  Yeah, just to give one piece of background, the person we mentioned is a long time supporter  
**[0:52:53-0:52:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:52:53):**  of the podcast and has visited, I wouldn't say seen the light, but long time investor  
**[0:52:58-0:53:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:52:58):**  in internet companies, a lot of experience on that side and basically saw the potential  
**[0:53:03-0:53:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:03):**  of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:04):**  And I think like many of us, you cannot unsee that, like there's no going back to what you  
**[0:53:09-0:53:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:09):**  were doing before.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:10):**  Maybe it's taking your experience of before and applying that, which is actually what  
**[0:53:13-0:53:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:13):**  he's doing.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:14):**  So shout out to that.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:15):**  And I think there are many that could, once you, it depends, it could be a TED talk, it  
**[0:53:18-0:53:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:18):**  could be a visit to a farm, it could be a book, it could be, I've heard many of those  
**[0:53:22-0:53:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:22):**  stories because I always ask the first question, why soil?  
**[0:53:26-0:53:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:26):**  But once you've seen that and experienced it and have seen successful regenerative farms  
**[0:53:32-0:53:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:32):**  and farmers, you're not going to unsee that.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:34):**  And so you're going to go back to commodity trading or go back to designing houses.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:38):**  I mean, it's very difficult to unsee.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:42):**  Two important things I think come to mind.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:45):**  One is, I forget who said this, but once your consciousness has expanded, it'll never take  
**[0:53:51-0:53:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:51):**  its original shape again.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:53):**  And I think this is the importance of eureka moments for farmers where they have ahas and  
**[0:53:59-0:54:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:53:59):**  going, oh my goodness.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:01):**  And then you have a breakthrough and to whatever degree you can create the container in which  
**[0:54:07-0:54:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:07):**  they self-experience that is the best thing.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:10):**  They have to own it.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:11):**  Facilitate it.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:13):**  It has to be completely their agency, authentic experience.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:17):**  And so that's the, I would say it's an implicit goal.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:20):**  We don't like set up to create that.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:22):**  It's just an implicit goal in which we look for those wins.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:26):**  I think it's time to dive a bit into the technical weeds, Brendan, because we've touched upon  
**[0:54:31-0:54:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:31):**  the perennial fund.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:32):**  We've mentioned revenue sharing and flexibility, et cetera.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:35):**  So what is the current iteration?  
**[0:54:36-0:54:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:36):**  We're in the end of May, 2020.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:38):**  I'm probably going to ask you in a few months it again, what is the perennial fund as we  
**[0:54:43-0:54:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:43):**  speak now?  
**[0:54:44-0:54:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:45):**  Good question.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:46):**  59 minutes in, a lot of foundational philosophy that we're grounded in now.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:50):**  I would say six seconds that we're in an hour.  
**[0:54:54-0:55:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:54:54):**  So the perennial fund is an organic transition operating loan that helps farmers transition  
**[0:55:00-0:55:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:55:00):**  conventional acres to organic.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:55:03):**  We couple in our technical assistance.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:55:06):**  So all of the farm planning that Phil went over, we wrap the payback in a revenue share.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:55:11):**  We cap the payback with a return cap at one and a half X.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:55:15):**  And at the end of 10 years, anything that the farmer owes that hasn't been paid back  
**[0:55:20-0:55:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:55:20):**  is forgiven and their debt is erased.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:55:23):**  So to get into the nitty gritty of how that works, what we're doing is issuing operating  
**[0:55:27-0:55:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:55:27):**  capital through the transition, which takes 36 months via the USDA organic certification.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:55:34):**  So from the last application of a prohibited substance, whether that be glyphosate or planting  
**[0:55:40-0:55:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:55:40):**  a GMO seed, you can then begin the transition to organic.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:55:45):**  The issue there is that you cannot sell it as an organic crop.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:55:48):**  You can only sell it as a conventional crop while experiencing reduced yields.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:55:53):**  So usually that results in losing money on an acre by acre basis.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:55:57):**  So we're doing is giving out operating capital through those transitioning years that is  
**[0:56:03-0:56:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:03):**  flexible on its payback during those 36 months.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:07):**  The farmer pays what they can through the transition.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:10):**  Sometimes we can even give them a grace period if that's warranted, but likely they might  
**[0:56:15-0:56:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:15):**  be paying 50, 100, $150 back on our loan.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:19):**  So they'll definitely be coming up short through the transition.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:23):**  And that's us understanding that they are seeing a loss on an acre by acre basis during  
**[0:56:29-0:56:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:29):**  those years.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:30):**  Once they hit certified organic, then the payback on the loan begins.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:34):**  It's based on a revenue share targeted on a five-year payback until one and a half X,  
**[0:56:39-0:56:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:39):**  whatever we loaned out is paid back.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:41):**  So let's say we were to give a loan of $100 an acre per year for three years, $300 total.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:48):**  That farmer would then owe $450 over the total life of the loan.  
**[0:56:53-0:56:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:53):**  So let's say they took a three-year grace period.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:55):**  They didn't pay anything during the transition.  
**[0:56:57-0:56:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:57):**  They're now certified organic.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:56:59):**  We would base the $450 payback on a five-year payback.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:57:03):**  So $90 a year for the course of the next five years.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:57:07):**  And that would fluctuate depending on the anticipated rotation and what we would expect  
**[0:57:12-0:57:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:57:12):**  between what they're growing, what they're yielding, where they're selling to over the  
**[0:57:16-0:57:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:57:16):**  course of those five years.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:57:18):**  It's likely to range between 20 to 40% of a revenue share.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:57:23):**  Really the highly dependent factor there is whether they own or lease the land.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:57:27):**  The cost of leasing is about twice the cost of ownership.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:57:31):**  It's between paying rent at 4% of the land's value versus owning it, which usually is around  
**[0:57:37-0:57:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:57:37):**  2% of the land's value on an annual basis.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:57:39):**  So three years of transition, five years of targeted payback.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:57:43):**  And then we build in two buffer years to account for varying market and weather conditions.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:57:48):**  So those are just zero years.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:57:51):**  If the crop gets hailed out in year six and the farmer can show us that and prove it,  
**[0:57:57-0:58:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:57:57):**  they will not owe us anything at the end of that season.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:00):**  Also because there's hardly any revenue.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:01):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:58:02-0:58:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:02):**  There's nothing to pay us.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:03):**  And there's no discussion.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:04):**  We're not going to take their land or their house or truck or whatever that may be just  
**[0:58:09-0:58:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:09):**  because they couldn't pay back in an individual year.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:11):**  This is an investment in them.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:14):**  It is a loan, but we just think of it as an investment.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:17):**  We're investing into their future over a longer term lens.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:21):**  So it's the total of a 10 year note, three years of giving out capital, five years payback,  
**[0:58:25-0:58:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:25):**  two buffer years.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:27):**  If we can't help connect them to the right markets, attain reasonable yields, help them  
**[0:58:33-0:58:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:33):**  access other types of capital that they might need for equipment and infrastructure, and  
**[0:58:38-0:58:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:38):**  they owe the 1.4x at the end of that 10 year period, and they're still short 0.1, we're  
**[0:58:44-0:58:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:44):**  going to forgive that in that instance.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:46):**  We've tried our best to help them successfully transition to organic.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:51):**  We both agreed to the terms.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:52):**  We went through that together.  
**[0:58:54-0:58:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:54):**  And we're trying to tie our red skin and the risk that they're taking.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:58:59):**  So those are more of the mechanics of how it's laid out.  
**[0:59:02-0:59:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:02):**  And last year, just I guess to build on the story of after we wrote the white paper and  
**[0:59:07-0:59:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:07):**  we realized that it was practical, we applied for an NRCS conservation innovation grant  
**[0:59:14-0:59:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:14):**  through June and July.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:15):**  We were granted that in December.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:18):**  So that's $817,000 over the next three years supported by the USDA to get this thing up  
**[0:59:24-0:59:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:24):**  and running and support our efforts for the next few years.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:27):**  So we're actually not even charging a management fee on the fund in the essence of testing  
**[0:59:32-0:59:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:32):**  this pilot, proving its viability, bringing in the right farmers, putting in the infrastructure,  
**[0:59:38-0:59:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:38):**  you know, financially, socially and farm planning wise so that we can scale up and flinch too  
**[0:59:43-0:59:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:43):**  and go for a more serious $50 million fund, $70 million.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:47):**  As a fund, what's the current, what are you targeting as a fund, let's say in terms of  
**[0:59:51-0:59:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:51):**  size and how many farmers and how many acres because probably it's connected to the farmers.  
**[0:59:56-0:59:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:56):**  What are you more or less looking at?  
**[0:59:57-0:59:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:57):**  What is the potential return?  
**[0:59:58-1:00:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=0:59:58):**  Let me ask the investor question as well, the financial return.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:02):**  What are more or less those pieces?  
**[1:00:04-1:00:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:04):**  Just to understand what we're talking about.  
**[1:00:05-1:00:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:05):**  Obviously you're developing, it's a pilot one.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:07):**  Nobody knows, but you have an idea.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:09):**  Yeah.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:10):**  So it's a $5 million fund targeting a 9% IRR based on the 20 years of historical organic  
**[1:00:16-1:00:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:16):**  data that we've collected and working with various extension agents, FinBin to collect  
**[1:00:22-1:00:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:22):**  all that information.  
**[1:00:24-1:00:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:24):**  Farmer wise, we're looking at 20 to 25 farmers across the upper Midwest.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:27):**  So Iowa, Eastern Nebraska, Southern Minnesota, Indiana.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:31):**  So 200,000, 250,000 per farm.  
**[1:00:35-1:00:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:35):**  Well it's going to be a more diversified approach.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:39):**  I have a couple farms in that 250,000 to 350,000 range and then have many more farms in the  
**[1:00:47-1:00:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:47):**  25 to $100,000 range.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:52):**  We'll have some efficiency in terms of deploying more capital and the farmers that we're very  
**[1:00:56-1:01:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:00:56):**  confident in that are larger and then diversifying and testing different solutions on the smaller  
**[1:01:01-1:01:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:01):**  farmers.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:02):**  So we find there's just varying ideals based on size, varying access to different markets  
**[1:01:07-1:01:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:07):**  or talking local markets that you can sell and direct it to consumer, actually putting  
**[1:01:12-1:01:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:12):**  a farmer's face behind a bag of beans.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:14):**  And then at the other scale, you're filling up an entire elevator with a single farmer's  
**[1:01:19-1:01:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:19):**  crop.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:20):**  So we're trying to diversify, learn, really understand those systems over the next few  
**[1:01:24-1:01:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:24):**  years.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:25):**  So looking at likely 5,000 to 8,000 acres between those 20 to 25 farmers, that could  
**[1:01:31-1:01:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:31):**  vary, could go a little higher or a little lower.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:34):**  Really just depends on who we ultimately choose to work with after running the full due diligence.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:41):**  Right now we have 24,000 acres in the pipeline and 60 farmers in the targeted area that we're  
**[1:01:47-1:01:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:47):**  looking to work with.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:49):**  We've had conversations with all of them and Phil and I are actually hopping in a Sprinter  
**[1:01:53-1:01:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:53):**  van in July and going on a road trip for a month to just get on the land, talk with all  
**[1:01:58-1:02:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:01:58):**  of them, get to meet them in person and hope.  
**[1:02:01-1:02:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:01):**  Sounds amazing.  
**[1:02:02-1:02:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:02):**  Thank you.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:04):**  Yeah, we would have had you come if it wasn't the pandemic.  
**[1:02:07-1:02:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:07):**  I would have been there.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:10):**  Could you maybe shed some light?  
**[1:02:12-1:02:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:12):**  I'd be interested to know, because you're going to so many experiences, many of which  
**[1:02:17-1:02:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:17):**  are going to be very different, but there's going to be quite a lot that are sort of similar  
**[1:02:23-1:02:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:23):**  or kindly similar, like growing that number of farmers on that scale.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:28):**  Do you have any sort of data driven processes?  
**[1:02:29-1:02:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:29):**  Do you have any sort of monitoring process in the back that allows you to take as much  
**[1:02:35-1:02:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:35):**  as you can from the experience that you go through with the different farmers?  
**[1:02:38-1:02:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:38):**  That's one side.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:39):**  And the other side, do you also, on a sort of strategic way, think about basically leveraging  
**[1:02:45-1:02:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:45):**  certain products and certain, I guess, buying behaviors that you can then basically share  
**[1:02:51-1:02:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:51):**  within the group?  
**[1:02:52-1:02:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:52):**  Is that something you also think about?  
**[1:02:53-1:02:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:53):**  Yeah, big time.  
**[1:02:55-1:03:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:02:55):**  We are really starting to develop more of our market dimension, and we'll probably be  
**[1:03:00-1:03:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:00):**  hiring in that zone here soon, where we need someone to be the liaison between the farmers  
**[1:03:07-1:03:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:07):**  and their products with the potential market offtakes with a whole host of CPG brands,  
**[1:03:13-1:03:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:13):**  consumer packaged goods brands that we know.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:15):**  Boulder is an epicenter of consumer packaged food.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:20):**  So we actually can come to the plains with a lot of those connections and do that matchmaking.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:26):**  We're already working, for instance, with Quinn Snacks.  
**[1:03:28-1:03:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:28):**  They sell in hundreds of whole food stores across America.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:31):**  They work on gluten free pretzels.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:34):**  So we've actually been helping farmers here transition and diversify their crops into  
**[1:03:38-1:03:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:38):**  like a food grade white sorghum.  
**[1:03:41-1:03:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:41):**  And that uses less water.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:42):**  It has a short growing season, so you can squeeze it in rotationally.  
**[1:03:45-1:03:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:45):**  But actually, it could be a really good thing for your farm, Benedict.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:48):**  I didn't see that on your crop list.  
**[1:03:50-1:03:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:50):**  And it's good for milling.  
**[1:03:52-1:03:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:52):**  It's great for the kind of gluten free celiac sensitive zone, et cetera.  
**[1:03:56-1:04:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:03:56):**  And so we're starting to pull and develop more relationships.  
**[1:04:00-1:04:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:00):**  Everyone from like Patagonia provisions to pipeline foods, and everyone in between our  
**[1:04:05-1:04:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:05):**  possibilities, it's about what is the most efficient model to kind of hold that portfolio  
**[1:04:11-1:04:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:11):**  of farmers, that wide diversity of farmers, and bottleneck them through these conduits  
**[1:04:17-1:04:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:17):**  and aggregators into those kind of market opportunities.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:20):**  There is clearly a huge need for infrastructure investment to enable regenerative supply.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:27):**  It's something that if we have another fund we're going to launch, it'd probably be dedicated  
**[1:04:31-1:04:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:31):**  to some infrastructure development.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:33):**  It's just hard to convince people to put things into low margin, high volume deals that require  
**[1:04:38-1:04:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:38):**  a lot of operations and maintenance.  
**[1:04:40-1:04:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:40):**  But it's got to happen.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:41):**  We can talk hours with Eric Jackson of Pipeline Foods about that.  
**[1:04:45-1:04:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:45):**  Exactly.  
**[1:04:46-1:04:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:46):**  It's not easy.  
**[1:04:47-1:04:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:47):**  It's very important, but it's not easy.  
**[1:04:49-1:04:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:49):**  But it's very important.  
**[1:04:50-1:04:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:50):**  And so, you know, there are ways to use the existing infrastructure and be strategic.  
**[1:04:56-1:04:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:56):**  We're going to try to bundle as much as we can with these farmers.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:04:59):**  We can work within a community of practice that are already linked through a social network,  
**[1:05:04-1:05:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:04):**  like the Practical Farmers of Iowa, or through Moses, or through a variety of other on the  
**[1:05:10-1:05:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:10):**  ground social fabrics that already exist in those states, then we'll do that.  
**[1:05:14-1:05:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:14):**  Do you then invest in all of them or you pick a few and then create social stress?  
**[1:05:18-1:05:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:18):**  Maybe.  
**[1:05:19-1:05:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:19):**  Yeah, we pick a few.  
**[1:05:20-1:05:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:20):**  We're not going to do it all.  
**[1:05:21-1:05:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:21):**  We don't have the resources and capacity to manage all that diversity, which is part of  
**[1:05:25-1:05:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:25):**  the purpose of our road trip in July.  
**[1:05:27-1:05:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:27):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[1:05:28-1:05:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:28):**  I mean, that community aspect of that is just incredible, right?  
**[1:05:32-1:05:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:32):**  Bringing all these people together who came from, you know, shared certain experiences  
**[1:05:37-1:05:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:37):**  together.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:38):**  Now they see new light, new opportunity.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:40):**  So again, you know, the sort of the effects that you bring on a social level, because  
**[1:05:45-1:05:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:45):**  they're obviously going to talk around in their area and they'll be interested.  
**[1:05:48-1:05:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:48):**  And so this is like, you can see it already spreading and the demand being bigger and  
**[1:05:54-1:05:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:54):**  bigger and bigger.  
**[1:05:55-1:05:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:55):**  And I sincerely think that, you know, on your side, you're going to be like, fuck, what  
**[1:05:59-1:06:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:05:59):**  do we get ourselves into?  
**[1:06:00-1:06:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:00):**  Because now we have just so many people to look at and screen and basically you just  
**[1:06:04-1:06:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:04):**  can't help them because others have to step in and which, again, obviously is a great  
**[1:06:10-1:06:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:10):**  opportunity, right?  
**[1:06:11-1:06:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:11):**  Yeah.  
**[1:06:12-1:06:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:12):**  One of the strategies is we're not Iowan.  
**[1:06:17-1:06:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:17):**  We're not from the upper Midwest.  
**[1:06:19-1:06:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:19):**  And so rather than Madag trying to impose our vision and selves in a place that we actually  
**[1:06:23-1:06:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:23):**  don't know that well, but we share at least a high level vision of where we're going,  
**[1:06:28-1:06:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:28):**  is that we're really working on the ground within existing trust networks and empowering  
**[1:06:32-1:06:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:32):**  the people in place.  
**[1:06:34-1:06:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:34):**  So working with the best people in that place and using our resource flow to actually align  
**[1:06:39-1:06:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:39):**  and empower rather than us trying to hold all those relationships.  
**[1:06:42-1:06:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:42):**  So we're actually actively talking with a bunch of different individuals in that region  
**[1:06:47-1:06:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:47):**  to be the glue of that farmer to farmer network and manage that conversation because they  
**[1:06:52-1:06:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:52):**  already have existing relationships.  
**[1:06:54-1:06:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:54):**  And us not trying to come in there like a bull in a China cabinet with all of our high  
**[1:06:59-1:07:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:06:59):**  ideals and lofty ambitions and financing solutions, it certainly matters and it's good to be there,  
**[1:07:05-1:07:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:05):**  but you've got to ground it, always ground it.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:08):**  And that really means funding the people in their place.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:11):**  So that's a big part of...  
**[1:07:13-1:07:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:13):**  So in the next couple of months, we'll have people with Madag trucker hats in the Midwest.  
**[1:07:19-1:07:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:19):**  Send us some, please.  
**[1:07:20-1:07:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:20):**  Oh, I will.  
**[1:07:21-1:07:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:21):**  Yeah, we'll send you some.  
**[1:07:22-1:07:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:22):**  We'll put you on our journal mailing list too.  
**[1:07:24-1:07:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:24):**  Maybe we'll just swap writing.  
**[1:07:26-1:07:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:26):**  Perfect.  
**[1:07:27-1:07:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:27):**  I think we can literally fill a lot of hours and I know that Brendan has to go at some  
**[1:07:34-1:07:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:34):**  point.  
**[1:07:35-1:07:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:35):**  Phil said he had three hours.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:36):**  Don't worry, we're not going to fill it all.  
**[1:07:38-1:07:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:38):**  But we could, we could.  
**[1:07:39-1:07:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:39):**  Any, I wouldn't say tips because tips sounds too cheesy and easy.  
**[1:07:45-1:07:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:45):**  Any suggestions, ideas for Benedict, who obviously is a farmer that probably now is wishing he  
**[1:07:50-1:07:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:50):**  was in the Midwest and could be part of Perennial Fund, but he's not.  
**[1:07:53-1:08:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:07:53):**  He's in Eastern Germany and is wrestling challenging, loving the challenge, but it is a challenge  
**[1:08:01-1:08:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:01):**  of potentially putting money to work.  
**[1:08:04-1:08:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:04):**  And any, what would be some ideas, directions, suggestions you would, questions you would  
**[1:08:09-1:08:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:09):**  ask, whatever your questions are about, you would ask him.  
**[1:08:11-1:08:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:11):**  Yeah, I mean, I think if I were there with Benedict now, we would take a whole day and  
**[1:08:14-1:08:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:14):**  kind of work through our farm planning process and we'd start with that kind of essence discovery  
**[1:08:19-1:08:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:19):**  and values alignment.  
**[1:08:22-1:08:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:22):**  And we'd spend a whole day together and work through the scales of permanence because there's  
**[1:08:26-1:08:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:26):**  a, the summary of your farm, what you're doing is really impressive.  
**[1:08:31-1:08:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:31):**  The things that pop out to me really quick are maybe some more dry land things and more  
**[1:08:35-1:08:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:35):**  perenniality working with 17 inches of rainfall or 150 millimeters or 150 millimeters rainfall.  
**[1:08:41-1:08:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:41):**  It's just, it's a really delicate zone.  
**[1:08:43-1:08:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:43):**  If you make a mistake, you're going to pay for years.  
**[1:08:45-1:08:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:45):**  And so looking for ways to really, looking for ways to keep the soil and the plant life  
**[1:08:50-1:08:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:50):**  intact.  
**[1:08:51-1:08:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:51):**  And then expanding more into kind of a grazing, ruminant animal husbandry system and linking  
**[1:08:55-1:08:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:55):**  that to your kind of market plays that are clearly direct to consumer.  
**[1:08:59-1:09:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:08:59):**  The ambitions of an education farm are awesome.  
**[1:09:01-1:09:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:01):**  I think that's needed.  
**[1:09:03-1:09:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:03):**  So to whatever degree you can turn it into a regenerative ag center, particularly because  
**[1:09:07-1:09:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:07):**  you have all that deep philosophical underpinning and that belief structure that I think is  
**[1:09:13-1:09:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:13):**  where a lot of people are finding themselves called to being that center of change that  
**[1:09:19-1:09:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:19):**  attracts and turning into that kind of more stone barns type center might be the best  
**[1:09:25-1:09:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:25):**  fit for that farm.  
**[1:09:26-1:09:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:26):**  Just because you're an attractor already, you're eloquent, you have the ability to harness  
**[1:09:32-1:09:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:32):**  social imagination and live with it.  
**[1:09:35-1:09:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:35):**  And I think that your farm is going to be unusual compared to the broad, what a commodity  
**[1:09:40-1:09:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:40):**  farm can do.  
**[1:09:42-1:09:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:42):**  I think it's really hard for a commodity farm to diversify and do direct consumer marketing  
**[1:09:46-1:09:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:46):**  because they often aren't evangelicals for their product and we can't expect them to  
**[1:09:51-1:09:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:51):**  become that.  
**[1:09:52-1:09:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:52):**  And so you have a unique set of personal tool, unique social and language toolkit that I  
**[1:09:59-1:10:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:09:59):**  think is well suited to that kind of direct marketing regenerative ag center type thing,  
**[1:10:04-1:10:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:04):**  which is utterly unique business model.  
**[1:10:07-1:10:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:07):**  If you think about a food hub, it has to be situated deeply in its place.  
**[1:10:12-1:10:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:12):**  And that's a customized process that is unique to the space and the person.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:16):**  And so for me, I sense that that's your potentiality and that's what's to pursue.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:21):**  And we get into the weeds of interesting crops.  
**[1:10:24-1:10:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:24):**  I think sorghum is super interesting, perennializing, grazing, but you're dry and you're brittle.  
**[1:10:29-1:10:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:29):**  And I didn't see if you had irrigation or not or whether it was all rain fed, but if  
**[1:10:32-1:10:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:32):**  you do have irrigation, that's a whole different conversation.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:34):**  If you're all rain fed, that even speaks more to a revitalization of the grasslands that  
**[1:10:40-1:10:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:40):**  were probably there.  
**[1:10:41-1:10:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:41):**  Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure about all the nice and positive things that you said about me,  
**[1:10:46-1:10:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:46):**  but what I can tell you though is that yesterday evening we had another 30 cows arrive, of  
**[1:10:52-1:10:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:52):**  which 20 are pregnant.  
**[1:10:53-1:10:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:53):**  So with the end of the year, we should be looking at around 100 heads going strongly.  
**[1:10:57-1:10:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:57):**  And I mean, I totally agree with you.  
**[1:10:58-1:11:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:10:58):**  I mean, this is pretty much what we focused right on as of having more sort of the whole  
**[1:11:03-1:11:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:11:03):**  grasslands cover crops and basically bring down the acres that we use for grain production,  
**[1:11:09-1:11:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:11:09):**  maybe only on maybe 40, 50% of the whole agricultural potential area and use the rest with the cows,  
**[1:11:16-1:11:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:11:16):**  obviously in the holistic management sense and have basically the cover crops and the  
**[1:11:20-1:11:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:11:20):**  grazing parts basically revitalized through what the cows bring to the table in many fronts.  
**[1:11:27-1:11:33](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:11:27):**  To then, if we grow a crop, we actually go harvesting five tons a hectare, whereas as  
**[1:11:33-1:11:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:11:33):**  of today, we'll be like around three tons per hectare.  
**[1:11:36-1:11:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:11:36):**  And the whole idea of having perennials is something that we are very keen on learning  
**[1:11:42-1:11:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:11:42):**  as much as we can, but because of the missing rainfall, because of the late frost risks,  
**[1:11:48-1:11:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:11:48):**  because of obviously the sandy soil, all we have to do is just to go crazy on species  
**[1:11:54-1:11:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:11:54):**  and kinds.  
**[1:11:55-1:12:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:11:55):**  So we have the highest diversity of plum trees and pears and all those different bushes and  
**[1:12:02-1:12:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:12:02):**  trees because out of a variety of 16 different species, probably only three or four can make  
**[1:12:07-1:12:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:12:07):**  it and as of today, no one can tell you that.  
**[1:12:10-1:12:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:12:10):**  So we have to do that first little step and although it is time consuming, I think if  
**[1:12:14-1:12:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:12:14):**  you don't do it, then it's not a clever decision to invest in that kind of thing because it  
**[1:12:19-1:12:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:12:19):**  could be the wrong species and then you're like, okay, that's a bugger.  
**[1:12:22-1:12:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:12:22):**  But obviously that's also the exciting part of it.  
**[1:12:25-1:12:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:12:25):**  And things move so incredibly quickly.  
**[1:12:29-1:12:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:12:29):**  But if I think back, the first cars arrived in end of April last year.  
**[1:12:36-1:12:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:12:36):**  We founded the company that we're doing all those kind of projects with at the farm level  
**[1:12:40-1:12:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:12:40):**  at the moment only in March last year.  
**[1:12:44-1:12:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:12:44):**  We founded a small agriculture company that we're doing all the sort of different multifunctional  
**[1:12:49-1:12:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:12:49):**  land use models from holistic grazing to agroforestry, centropic agriculture, the called composting  
**[1:12:54-1:13:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:12:54):**  parts, because on paper or theoretically, they're all sort of in the gray zone in Germany  
**[1:13:00-1:13:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:00):**  as far as you're allowed to do certain things, which has no theoretical backing, but they  
**[1:13:06-1:13:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:06):**  just don't fit into the German rules and regulation framework sort of thing.  
**[1:13:13-1:13:16](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:13):**  I'm going to get angry emails, I know already.  
**[1:13:16-1:13:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:16):**  We use that to be more free in the way that we can try it.  
**[1:13:20-1:13:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:20):**  But if we have visitors come and experience it, none of them is going to be say, well,  
**[1:13:25-1:13:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:25):**  that doesn't make sense.  
**[1:13:26-1:13:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:26):**  No, they're all like, wow, fuck, yeah, that's incredible.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:29):**  Let's do that.  
**[1:13:30-1:13:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:30):**  Right.  
**[1:13:31-1:13:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:31):**  So I think that making it experienceable, not just hypothetically talking about, wouldn't  
**[1:13:36-1:13:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:36):**  it make sense in a dry environment to plant thin tree rows spread across evenly about  
**[1:13:42-1:13:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:42):**  the field to reduce erosion, wind erosion, water erosion, also change the microclimate  
**[1:13:47-1:13:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:47):**  within the rows.  
**[1:13:48-1:13:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:48):**  Everyone will be like, yeah, I'm not sure planting trees on the field is such a clever  
**[1:13:53-1:13:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:53):**  idea.  
**[1:13:54-1:13:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:54):**  But once they come and they realize it and see it and also have basically, if you can,  
**[1:13:59-1:14:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:13:59):**  scientific backing and sort of development, then that obviously can leapfrog the change  
**[1:14:04-1:14:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:04):**  in thinking.  
**[1:14:05-1:14:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:05):**  And I think that's so crucial.  
**[1:14:06-1:14:07](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:06):**  Right.  
**[1:14:07-1:14:11](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:07):**  But in the end of the day, to be honest with you, obviously, we have an incredible time  
**[1:14:11-1:14:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:11):**  doing what we're doing, because obviously, there's so many people that come and that  
**[1:14:15-1:14:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:15):**  help us and that work with us and live with us, and it's just an awesome community.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:20):**  But to be honest with you, the idea, of course, is to find land use models that work and that  
**[1:14:25-1:14:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:25):**  can be scalable.  
**[1:14:27-1:14:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:27):**  So what we try to do is bring in technology.  
**[1:14:29-1:14:35](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:29):**  Basically, we try to find groups and friends and like minded people who come from different  
**[1:14:35-1:14:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:35):**  other angles in the industry that develop the machines that we use, because there's  
**[1:14:39-1:14:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:39):**  just such a huge potential and different machines that we can use and that we can develop.  
**[1:14:44-1:14:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:44):**  And I think that is also part of it.  
**[1:14:45-1:14:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:45):**  So I mean, it's just I'm very grateful for being able to do what we're doing or what  
**[1:14:50-1:14:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:50):**  we can do.  
**[1:14:51-1:14:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:51):**  Yeah, I think that I love that.  
**[1:14:53-1:14:59](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:53):**  I mean, when I go to Stone Barns or any other ag center, I think they're really important  
**[1:14:59-1:15:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:14:59):**  for inspiring not only culture and society, but also providing that like tip of the spear  
**[1:15:05-1:15:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:05):**  push that lets others not bear that risk.  
**[1:15:09-1:15:14](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:09):**  So if you're the one experiencing machinery, and farmers can come field days and see how  
**[1:15:14-1:15:20](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:14):**  it's working, like you're de-risking that technological solution and the opportunity.  
**[1:15:20-1:15:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:20):**  I think it's a really important tool for the kinds of institutions that are regionally  
**[1:15:24-1:15:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:24):**  situated.  
**[1:15:25-1:15:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:25):**  The other thing too that came to mind, two things in your farm was what is your pulse  
**[1:15:30-1:15:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:30):**  rotation in a dry land.  
**[1:15:32-1:15:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:32):**  So I think of it, garbanzo beans and lentils, two plant based proteins that are on the rise.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:38):**  They probably do well in your area if you have enough growing degree days and you don't  
**[1:15:41-1:15:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:41):**  get too much rainfall in the late summer.  
**[1:15:44-1:15:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:44):**  What was the first one you said lentils and?  
**[1:15:47-1:15:49](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:47):**  Garbanzo beans, chickpeas.  
**[1:15:49-1:15:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:49):**  Oh chickpeas.  
**[1:15:51-1:15:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:51):**  The other thing is a little bigger idea is the idea of not only demonstrating all of  
**[1:15:56-1:16:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:15:56):**  these possibilities, but also being an aggregator.  
**[1:16:00-1:16:05](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:16:00):**  So if you have an ability to actually create demand, so like let's say you buy a grain  
**[1:16:05-1:16:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:16:05):**  bin for all your grains or you buy a big barn for all your hay, like you can actually create  
**[1:16:10-1:16:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:16:10):**  an attractor for those in your region, which becomes an invitation for others to change.  
**[1:16:15-1:16:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:16:15):**  I wonder if you're yourself moving from that first mover to early adopter, where are you  
**[1:16:22-1:16:28](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:16:22):**  in that sort of level of being a renegade versus a community leader and what's that  
**[1:16:28-1:16:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:16:28):**  kind of personal landscape for you and where you want to go individually?  
**[1:16:34-1:16:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:16:34):**  To be honest with you, I think it's too early to tell.  
**[1:16:38-1:16:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:16:38):**  We are at the stage where everything we do, we do wrong and we don't know anything and  
**[1:16:44-1:16:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:16:44):**  we just do it.  
**[1:16:46-1:16:50](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:16:46):**  And once we think we have figured out something a bit better, we do just as much mistakes,  
**[1:16:50-1:16:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:16:50):**  just different mistakes.  
**[1:16:52-1:16:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:16:52):**  So I'm far away from either being able to tell others how they can do it.  
**[1:16:57-1:17:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:16:57):**  I'm far away from knowing what works.  
**[1:17:01-1:17:06](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:01):**  So basically I think we're doing things that not so many other people are doing right now  
**[1:17:06-1:17:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:06):**  and this has some value in itself because I realize certain things, people that are  
**[1:17:13-1:17:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:13):**  here realize certain things, there's sort of an energy happening from it.  
**[1:17:17-1:17:22](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:17):**  But I would feel much more comfortable if I could look back on a time and say, look,  
**[1:17:22-1:17:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:22):**  this is where we started.  
**[1:17:24-1:17:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:24):**  This is the road that we took.  
**[1:17:26-1:17:27](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:26):**  This is where we are today.  
**[1:17:27-1:17:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:27):**  And I can basically show you certain numbers.  
**[1:17:30-1:17:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:30):**  I can show you certain developments and far as the ecological side is concerned, the economic  
**[1:17:34-1:17:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:34):**  side is concerned, but maybe also on a social attitude or on a social level.  
**[1:17:39-1:17:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:39):**  I think once you have that, you still have to be very aware that this is what worked  
**[1:17:43-1:17:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:43):**  in your context and it has to be far, that's just 500 meter away.  
**[1:17:48-1:17:52](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:48):**  That doesn't necessarily mean it works for her or for him, right?  
**[1:17:52-1:17:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:52):**  So I don't know, what my strongest belief in all of this is that it's the narrative,  
**[1:17:57-1:18:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:17:57):**  it's the doing it, it's the story, it's the passion and the love that you bring into it,  
**[1:18:02-1:18:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:02):**  the energy, because I think I was a really, really bad student and I generally don't like  
**[1:18:08-1:18:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:08):**  being told things, right?  
**[1:18:10-1:18:13](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:10):**  I think there's quite a few of us who are like that.  
**[1:18:13-1:18:19](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:13):**  So I think if we look at ways of how we can change, how we can make others also change,  
**[1:18:19-1:18:23](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:19):**  it's never good to say, well, don't do that anymore because that's bad or whatever and  
**[1:18:23-1:18:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:23):**  do this or do that.  
**[1:18:25-1:18:32](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:25):**  But try to do something yourself that has so much that people feel or see or realize  
**[1:18:32-1:18:34](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:32):**  because they also want that.  
**[1:18:34-1:18:37](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:34):**  They also, oh, you guys are laughing all the time.  
**[1:18:37-1:18:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:37):**  What are you doing?  
**[1:18:38-1:18:39](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:38):**  I want that too.  
**[1:18:39-1:18:40](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:39):**  What is it that you're doing?  
**[1:18:40-1:18:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:40):**  So basically create an energy that draws people in and they come basically to you.  
**[1:18:45-1:18:48](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:45):**  And so we are at the very, very beginning.  
**[1:18:48-1:18:54](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:48):**  So I don't think we're anything than a couple of people who have a certain vision and just  
**[1:18:54-1:19:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:18:54):**  the possibility and the freedom to just plant weird stuff on fields and have animals and  
**[1:19:00-1:19:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:00):**  like do mistakes all day, basically.  
**[1:19:03-1:19:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:03):**  But that's why we're here.  
**[1:19:04-1:19:08](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:04):**  I mean, I was in Berlin, we got connected through a mutual friend and you said, come  
**[1:19:08-1:19:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:08):**  over and that and not even a year ago and look where we end up now.  
**[1:19:12-1:19:18](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:12):**  So I think you already are attracting a lot of that energy and those people that want  
**[1:19:18-1:19:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:18):**  to build compost systems like we discussed in the episode with Robin and attract market  
**[1:19:24-1:19:29](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:24):**  gardeners and attract cows apparently and bees and a lot of other stuff.  
**[1:19:29-1:19:30](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:29):**  Yeah, you're doing it.  
**[1:19:30-1:19:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:30):**  That's exactly what your mantra or your purpose is, is in the doing.  
**[1:19:36-1:19:38](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:36):**  It's like thoughts without action are dead.  
**[1:19:38-1:19:45](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:38):**  And I think that we have to, it's all in the practice and not being afraid of quote unquote  
**[1:19:45-1:19:46](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:45):**  failure.  
**[1:19:46-1:19:51](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:46):**  As we say, we're building this ship as we sail and that's all you can do.  
**[1:19:51-1:19:56](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:51):**  The Germans obviously have a word for this all the way called, we cross the bridge when  
**[1:19:56-1:19:57](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:56):**  we get there.  
**[1:19:57-1:20:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:19:57):**  I'm imagining like this cartoon where you jump out of the plane and on the way you have  
**[1:20:01-1:20:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:01):**  to build or like almost stitch the parachute.  
**[1:20:04-1:20:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:04):**  That's sort of the feeling I think sometimes some of the farmers I know have.  
**[1:20:10-1:20:12](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:10):**  I think it's, I mean, we're one and a half hour in.  
**[1:20:12-1:20:17](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:12):**  I have the feeling we, as always, I say that a lot of times we scratch the surface, but  
**[1:20:17-1:20:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:17):**  I think it's also a good moment to stop and to stop at least for now.  
**[1:20:21-1:20:25](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:21):**  I want to thank, I can open it up obviously for some last thoughts, et cetera, but I want  
**[1:20:25-1:20:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:25):**  to first of all, thank all of you for taking this time early morning, early evening, and  
**[1:20:31-1:20:36](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:31):**  obviously coming here and share from a place of learning and openness and caring.  
**[1:20:36-1:20:41](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:36):**  And I think that's, it doesn't happen enough and it's good to see that it can happen on  
**[1:20:41-1:20:42](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:41):**  this podcast.  
**[1:20:42-1:20:43](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:42):**  Yeah.  
**[1:20:43-1:20:44](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:43):**  Well, thank you, Ken.  
**[1:20:44-1:20:47](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:44):**  It's awesome that you've put this great community together.  
**[1:20:47-1:20:53](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:47):**  You know, we've been able to meet some wonderful people just through this podcast, just through  
**[1:20:53-1:20:55](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:53):**  this now global community that's building.  
**[1:20:55-1:20:58](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:55):**  So I really appreciate both of your works.  
**[1:20:58-1:21:00](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:20:58):**  Thanks for having us.  
**[1:21:00-1:21:01](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:21:00):**  Yeah.  
**[1:21:01-1:21:02](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:21:01):**  Likewise.  
**[1:21:02-1:21:03](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:21:02):**  Yeah.  
**[1:21:03-1:21:04](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:21:03):**  Deep gratitude.  
**[1:21:04-1:21:09](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:21:04):**  It's fun to, I was reflecting on Benedict's comments around how remarkable our cared feeling  
**[1:21:09-1:21:10](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:21:09):**  and sense of purpose is.  
**[1:21:10-1:21:15](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:21:10):**  And I think that's a beautiful thing and that's something larger calling us into being.  
**[1:21:15-1:21:21](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:21:15):**  It's the feeling of emergence and it's the feeling of living in a paradigm shift.  
**[1:21:21-1:21:24](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:21:21):**  And I think we're at that edge.  
**[1:21:24-1:21:26](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:21:24):**  It's tumultuous, it's beautiful.  
**[1:21:26-1:21:31](http://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/16/transition-finance-ep7#t=1:21:26):**  It's like a galaxy expanding and we don't know what's going to come yet, but let's participate.

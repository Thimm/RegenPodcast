**[0:00:55-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:00:55):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:00:57):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:01-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:01:01):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.

**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:01:08):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:01:13):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:17-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:01:17):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:01:20):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:01:24):**  There are more interviews, there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative

**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:01:53):**  Enjoy!

**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:02):**  Ventures, completely focused on introducing agroforestry in existing, operating farms.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:08):**  Basically making sure farmers plant many more trees on their land.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:11):**  I'm really excited to learn more about their work and ask them all about the nerdy details.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:15):**  Welcome Ethan, Jeremy and Harry.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:16):**  Thanks for having us.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:17):**  Excited to be here.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:18):**  So to start with a personal question, and we're going to keep it brief because otherwise  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:22):**  we'll spend the next two hours on this.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:24):**  How did you, the three of you actually, end up individually on the soil and how did you  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:28):**  end up, the three of you, working together on soil?  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:30):**  Yeah, it's a great question.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:33):**  It goes back far into the roots.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:34):**  This is Jeremy here, just for the viewers to know voices.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:39):**  So my roots are actually in family business, in and around stair and railing manufacturing,  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:45):**  which was intimately connected to the housing markets and through my family intimately connected  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:51):**  to the timber industry.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:02:56):**  From there I kind of got a little bit of the start in and around trees and what they do  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:01):**  for the market.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:03):**  And then went to college, started working on organic lettuce and grass-fed dairy farms.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:11):**  After college, took a stint in San Francisco working for a few innovation firms.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:19):**  Learned how to design software and build software.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:23):**  Moved back to New York and survived my software life to return back to working in agriculture  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:30):**  and wanting to try to shift that system.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:33):**  And that kind of led me into back to my roots, wanting to work with tree crops as a result.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:39):**  There's a longer story there as to how Propagate Ventures came into being, but I want to give  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:44):**  these two guys an opportunity before we jump into how we came together.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:47):**  Hi, Koon.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:48):**  Hi, Matt.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:49):**  Thanks for having us.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:50):**  This is Harry here.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:51):**  So I was an athlete for a good amount of my life.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:03:56):**  I was an Olympic hopeful up until 2015 in the sport of modern pentathlon.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:04:03):**  So my performance was dependent on the quality of food I ate, and the quality of food I ate  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:04:09):**  was dependent on the soil that it was grown in.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:04:12):**  And burning so many calories, I not only had to ask where my micronutrients came from,  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:04:20):**  my fruits and vegetables, but also where my calories came from.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:04:24):**  And that led me to look into broad acre agriculture and the status quo of where humanity's sustenance  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:04:33):**  is grown.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:04:35):**  And I grew up at a summer camp, and that land stewardship ethic led me to want to make farming  
**[0:04:47-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:04:47):**  more sustainable, more regenerative with tree crops, having grown up in the forest.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:04:55):**  And my background is in finance.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:04:58):**  So working through the time value of money and combining traditional finance with forestry  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:05:09):**  applied to farmland, that's really where this idea of agroforestry finance came from.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:05:16):**  And I'll hop in here.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:05:17):**  This is Ethan.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:05:18):**  I guess I'm last but not least.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:05:22):**  So my background has been working with startup companies and consumer brands on their sustainability  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:05:28):**  strategy all through the course of small little startup companies through to larger brands  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:05:34):**  like the Super Bowl.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:05:36):**  And so I had an opportunity to see a lot of the movement in the space of impact investing,  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:05:41):**  in the space of social entrepreneurship, and how brands, specifically consumer brands,  
**[0:05:46-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:05:46):**  were playing a role in the next phase in which we're looking at a sustainable future.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:05:55):**  And one of the things I had started to look at through that time was what were the leverage  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:06:02):**  points really focused on the renewable energies and clean tech space for a while and the movement  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:06:07):**  we've seen there, especially in the impact investing front.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:06:10):**  And then what is the next leverage point in terms of the impact that I think we'd all  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:06:15):**  like to see take place?  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:06:18):**  And that led me into agriculture.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:06:21):**  I think the three of us all had an opportunity to engage with agriculture based off of the  
**[0:06:26-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:06:26):**  food we were consuming through health concerns or from on Harry's side of the coin, the importance  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:06:34):**  of the nutrients for athletic performance.

**[0:06:40-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:06:40):**  So the nutrient value of the food I was eating, I found, was intimately connected with what  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:06:47):**  I've been saying is if it's healthy for the earth, it's likely also healthy for me to  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:06:52):**  consume.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:06:53):**  And that is one of the ways in which the three of us really came together and understood  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:06:58):**  some of the leverage points in which to intervene in a system that has an opportunity to create  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:07:04):**  solutions rather than cause problems.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:07:06):**  And that's agriculture.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:07:07):**  Yeah, that makes extreme sense as a leverage point, the land that we have.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:07:13):**  So I want to ask the question, so from that, how do we make land more sustainable?  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:07:21):**  How do you get to agroforestry and introducing that?  
**[0:07:25-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:07:25):**  Yeah, so as an organization, we're the onset of the research that led us to agroforestry.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:07:34):**  We did a lot of travel, talking to farmers across the US and around the world, from anywhere  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:07:43):**  from France down into Brazil, Argentina.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:07:47):**  And a lot of what we were seeing in terms of the motion of the industry of farming and  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:07:53):**  how things were moving was toward some of the regenerative solutions in soil.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:07:59):**  So that the no-till agriculture, grass-fed, holistic managed grazing.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:08:06):**  And what we found was there was a little bit of a gap in areas where land was naturally  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:08:12):**  forest land, but it was still in productive agriculture.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:08:18):**  So we saw that there was a missing void in this regenerative movement to be able to make  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:08:24):**  tree crops a profitable layer to the farm landscape.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:08:28):**  There are a few pioneers that have done this across the world in terms of their research  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:08:32):**  over the last four years that have really gone through the process of feeling into what  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:08:38):**  works and what doesn't.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:08:41):**  And we have a lot of their work to attribute to.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:08:43):**  What we found was that for most farmers, putting their money into tree crops for a long-term  
**[0:08:49-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:08:49):**  investment was too big of a risk relative to their cash generation, whether it be cattle  
**[0:08:57-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:08:57):**  or annual grain.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:08:59):**  So what we wanted to do was to give them the capacity to be able to potentially put those  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:09:03):**  trees in the ground without lowering their upfront risk.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:09:07):**  And that was a real discovery process over the course of a year of talking to a lot of  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:09:13):**  farmers across the entire industry, looking at where the gaps were in investment for deployment  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:09:19):**  of systems that were regenerative.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:09:23):**  Agroforestry as a whole, in terms of the general practice, we landed on primarily out of its  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:09:30):**  regenerative capabilities in terms of its production from an economic standpoint, as  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:09:36):**  well as production from an ecological standpoint to be able to regenerate soil, as well as  
**[0:09:42-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:09:42):**  sequester carbon, prevent nutrient runoff, prevent soil erosion, things of that nature.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:09:50):**  So it was a real journey in conversation to get to where we are, where we landed on agroforestry  
**[0:09:55-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:09:55):**  as the primary lever that we wanted to focus on.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:09:58):**  And during that journey of a year that you described just now, were you already the three  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:10:03):**  of you or how did you find each other during the journey?  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:10:07):**  And if so, who started?  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:10:09):**  Yeah, so Jeremy and I were introduced in the spring of 2016 through a mutual friend.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:10:16):**  And Jeremy and Ethan actually went to university together.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:10:20):**  And Jeremy and I linked up and with Ethan over this, I guess, past almost two years  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:10:29):**  now, we've been on the journey together.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:10:32):**  And so you ended up on how to bring agroforestry to scale basically.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:10:38):**  And can you walk us or me and the listeners through what you ended up developing and what  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:10:45):**  you're currently, of course, it's still under development, but what are the main, what can  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:10:49):**  you offer a farmer?  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:10:50):**  Let's say I'm a grain farmer, somewhere where you're operating, what's currently the process  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:10:55):**  to start getting more trees, productive trees on my land, which I don't have at the moment,  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:11:00):**  at the moment, it's just a flat grain land without any trees, unfortunately.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:11:05):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:11:07):**  So the first thing that we do, we work with farmers is start with their goals.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:11:13):**  We have our first program that every project goes through is called a subsoil, which is  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:11:19):**  our name for it, which is an audit that allows us to determine what the farmers goals are,  
**[0:11:24-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:11:24):**  their existing operation and a system design that fits that operation and that within the  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:11:31):**  budget price points and their goals for how they want to deploy those trees over time.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:11:37):**  And then there's some other stuff that we do in the background as kind of assistance  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:11:42):**  with regards to market analysis to determine the market for those trees through to management  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:11:47):**  workflow analysis to make sure that the labor that will be applied on that project will  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:11:51):**  be there and it will be properly executed to bring those products from those trees to  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:11:57):**  success in the marketplace.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:11:59):**  And then from there, we have two vehicles that are depending on the farmers goals we  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:12:04):**  utilize to deploy those trees.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:12:07):**  One is a debt vehicle, which for specifically for farmers that want to own their own system  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:12:12):**  on their land and operate their own system, where they pay over the course of a three  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:12:19):**  to seven year term for trees that will be deployed over the course of that timeframe  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:12:24):**  across their landscape.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:12:27):**  Over the course of that time, they're buying into that system, we're assisting them through  
**[0:12:30-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:12:30):**  to the deployment.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:12:31):**  After the deployment, they take on ownership and then we have kind of softer market help  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:12:37):**  that we provide as a service with regards to things like helping them get their market,  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:12:43):**  their products from those trees to market.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:12:45):**  On the other side of it, for farmers that don't really want to operate their system,  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:12:50):**  they're focused heavily on grain or grass fed beef, but they still want the benefits  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:12:55):**  of the trees and then potentially some passive income.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:12:58):**  What we do is we enter into a profit share partnership and take on the equity in those  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:13:02):**  trees.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:13:03):**  We do this through taking on a ground lease for the footprint of the trees and a very  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:13:09):**  low cost mix and then they actually engage your profit share partnership on the returns  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:13:13):**  coming off those tree crops in the long term.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:13:16):**  What we do is then bridge project level finance requirements by bringing in outside investors  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:13:22):**  to make up the capital requirements to operate those trees over their lifetime.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:13:26):**  Those are the two vehicles that we have that bring trees to the landscape.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:13:32):**  The goal really being to have productive, economically viable, and with tree crops with  
**[0:13:38-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:13:38):**  an ecological underbelly that provides inherent ecosystem services in the process.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:13:45):**  What kind of trees should I imagine as a farmer?  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:13:48):**  What can I imagine that you are working with now that you could promote to me and what  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:13:55):**  would that look like in terms of products that you mentioned?  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:13:58):**  We primarily focus on fruit, nut, and timber trees.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:14:04):**  Which trees would go on which landscape is dependent really on the goals of the farmer.

**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:14:28):**  The apples would be or any type of fruit would be a better fit for a more social farmer just

**[0:14:40-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:14:40):**  The amount of labor hours for an apple tree to fertilize, spray compost tea, prune it,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:14:48):**  and harvest every year is much greater than the time requirement to plant a timber tree,  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:14:55):**  prune it every few years, and then manage the final harvest after 15 or 20 years.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:15:01):**  It means that if a farmer likes to have people on his or her farm, apples might make sense.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:15:06):**  If they don't, then probably another type of tree is more appropriate.

**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:15:29):**  A note on that also is a lot of the conversation isn't around what the financial goals are

**[0:15:53-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:15:53):**  If it is a question of what with the goals of the farmer in mind, with the goals of the

**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:16:49):**  From the perspective of where a brand might play a role, there's definitely a piece in  
**[0:16:55-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:16:55):**  terms of connecting with what we would define in our office as the aspirationals.

**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:17:07):**  Essentially it's like millennials plus and these are the very conscious consumers that  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:17:12):**  are looking at the inputs of how their food is grown.

**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:17:20):**  These are the consumers that are looking for products that provide some sort of social

**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:17:56):**  in in terms of the development of the products all the way through to the sale of their products.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:18:02):**  The way in which we're understanding this discussion is that by bringing brands in and  
**[0:18:07-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:18:07):**  buyers into discussion earlier, there's an opportunity to engage in pre-purchase agreements  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:18:15):**  that allow to create some certainty for the farmers that we're working with in terms of  
**[0:18:19-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:18:19):**  putting those trees in the landscape.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:18:22):**  In the world of solar, this similar kind of framework of thinking was taking place through  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:18:28):**  the concept of the power purchase agreement.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:18:31):**  It was going to be my next question.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:18:35):**  Can you walk us through that?

**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:18:40):**  They're both a solar business as trees use their leaves, obviously, but maybe that's  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:18:46):**  a bit far-fetched.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:18:48):**  Can you walk us through the similarities and why it makes so much sense to go towards those  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:18:55):**  purchase agreements?

**[0:19:01-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:19:01):**  Yeah, absolutely.

**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:19:06):**  First and foremost being in the landscape, a farmer or a landowner can own their own  
**[0:19:11-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:19:11):**  system and pay in that system over time, or they can lease their land to some sort of  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:19:18):**  installation company that's selling into a utility.

**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:19:27):**  lending into these markets is because utility companies were taking commitments through

**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:19:47):**  in place.

**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:20:23):**  place, or at least a percentage of them do set in at a certain price.

**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:20:34):**  and how that builds better certainty for investors.

**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:20:50):**  excitement is on the side of as brands are engaging in this process, there's certainly

**[0:21:55-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:21:55):**  valuable assets, both tangible and intangible assets that can be utilized from the perspective  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:22:02):**  of a brand that's engaging in this type of work.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:22:06):**  And in terms of concrete brands, because you're a relatively young company, can you share  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:22:12):**  a bit of maybe some names even, but if that's not possible, obviously not, of brands you  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:22:18):**  are, type of brands you are working with that are engaged with you to see how they can get  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:22:23):**  many more trees in the ground?  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:22:25):**  Sure, absolutely.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:22:27):**  And this is a constantly moving process.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:22:31):**  One of the brands that we're excited to be working with is a brand based out of Quebec,  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:22:38):**  a brand in Monaco, they're a personal care brand, and they're looking at the value of  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:22:42):**  apple cider vinegar for shampoo and conditioner products.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:22:48):**  One of the ways that we're working with them through this is producing apples on a farm  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:22:53):**  in southern Quebec, that those apples will go direct into their supply for the creation  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:23:00):**  of these apple cider vinegar based products.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:23:04):**  Now there's an extraordinary amount of carbon offset, or what we like to consider a carbon  
**[0:23:10-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:23:10):**  inset, meaning those offsets that are taking place, the reduction or the carbon sequestration  
**[0:23:18-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:23:18):**  that's happening there, it is built directly into the productive trees that are going direct  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:23:26):**  into their supply web.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:23:28):**  So this is a brand that we're working with, and we're really testing out the model and  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:23:34):**  working very closely with these folks on how this works.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:23:38):**  And there's a few other examples of brands, some in the hard cider space that are also  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:23:46):**  apples direct to hard cider creation and then selling that product.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:23:50):**  So there's a lot that's taking place, an opportunity for different brands to get engaged, and we're  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:23:55):**  increasing opportunities for brands of larger magnitude to engage in this type of work.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:24:01):**  And in this case, the brand in Quebec, how does it work?  
**[0:24:05-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:24:05):**  Are these apple trees are already in the ground or these are extra trees that are planted  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:24:13):**  because you're working with the farmers and the company on the other side and basically  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:24:17):**  connecting them and making sure these trees go into the ground?  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:24:20):**  How does it work in practice?  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:24:21):**  Or will it work?  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:24:22):**  Maybe I don't know how far you are.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:24:23):**  Oh, yeah, no worries.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:24:24):**  So that family farm currently runs not an organic apple orchard, but a conventional  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:24:29):**  orchard, and what they want to do is add an organic system into pasture land.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:24:35):**  So where we are right now with them is in the orchard design process and not just the  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:24:41):**  physical design of the orchard and what that looks like in terms of soil prep and planting  
**[0:24:46-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:24:46):**  and the overall implementation, but modeling the installation costs, the management costs  
**[0:24:54-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:24:54):**  and the harvest costs put together with the expected revenues such that they can understand  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:25:03):**  the present value of the system and what that's going to look like over time.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:25:09):**  So these will be apple trees, sorry, apple trees into a range land basically that currently  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:25:16):**  doesn't have any trees in it.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:25:17):**  This will be a mixed livestock and apple system.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:25:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:25:20):**  There aren't livestock there right now, although there could be in the future.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:25:25):**  It's a forested biome, southern Quebec.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:25:27):**  So it's not like Saskatchewan or Alberta, which is mainly grassland.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:25:32):**  So it's a pasture that will be adding apple trees to not create a forest once again, but  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:25:39):**  create an anthropogenic forest, which is usually just called an orchard.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:25:46):**  And what's the reason for the current non-organic apple orchard to not convert?  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:25:51):**  Yeah, so it's actually really difficult to convert a conventional apple orchard to an  
**[0:25:58-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:25:58):**  organic system.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:25:59):**  It takes between eight and ten years to do that.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:26:02):**  And that lag time generally renders the process to be not profitable at all.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:26:09):**  You basically have to start from scratch.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:26:11):**  Yeah, it's easier to start from scratch.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:26:14):**  Especially during alcohol prohibition, at least in the United States, the government  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:26:19):**  had all of the old heirloom cider orchards cut down and replaced all of that apple orchard  
**[0:26:25-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:26:25):**  with conventional production of a few select varieties that most consumers are familiar  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:26:34):**  with.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:26:35):**  But that was the beginning of the era of 100 percent conventional production when organic  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:26:41):**  wasn't even a known term.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:26:43):**  So we've largely also forgotten how to grow organic apples.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:26:49):**  And rebuilding that industry is a challenge in the Northeast, but it's also an opportunity.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:26:58):**  And just for some reference on that, organic apples in the U.S., as an example, have been  
**[0:27:03-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:27:03):**  growing pretty fast over the last ten years, upwards of 13 percent over the course of the  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:27:11):**  last ten years.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:27:14):**  There's a fun history on a lot of the lineages of how this all works.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:27:19):**  And we can definitely geek out on the details of what the history and the historic value  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:27:25):**  of some of these different crop types in the United States are, from apples to chestnuts  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:27:31):**  and beyond.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:27:32):**  One of the things I do want to recognize on that project with Oneka is we've had the chance  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:27:38):**  to partner with two other great organizations, Regeneration Canada and Docteur, who are working  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:27:44):**  on the soil side and the carbon offset side of that project to kind of bring it to a public  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:27:51):**  audience of what a project can do.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:27:54):**  They've been great partners in that process as well.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:27:57):**  And how many trees are we talking about?  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:27:59):**  Just to have an idea.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:00):**  And how much shampoo is that?  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:03):**  So it starts.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:04):**  So we're starting with two acres, and then each year we're going to be adding additional  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:09):**  acres there.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:10):**  That's anywhere from 60 to 100 trees to 140 trees per acre, depending on the size of the  
**[0:28:20-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:20):**  tree, because apple trees vary in size from anywhere from eight feet tall to 20 feet tall.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:28):**  We're actually not shampoo producers, so we're not sure how much shampoo that will produce,  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:33):**  but it will be more than enough vinegar to satisfy Oneka's needs for now, we anticipate.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:40):**  And the apples that will turn into vinegar will likely end up being the B and C grade  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:47):**  apples.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:48):**  So the highest quality apples can actually be sold just as dessert apples to eat fresh  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:54):**  out of hand.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:55):**  Wow.

**[0:28:57-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:28:57):**  And it's worth mentioning that there's kind of multiple...  
**[0:29:00-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:29:00):**  Right now what we're seeing is a lot of the smaller brands wanting to play around in the

**[0:29:08-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:29:08):**  Brands who are growing pretty fast, but have a really strong team ethic around soil regeneration.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:29:17):**  And the big players tend to move a little slower, but the conversation is really starting  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:29:21):**  to shift into larger and larger brands over time.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:29:25):**  For example, Patagonia and who else was part of their regenerative organic standard and

**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:29:40):**  so aggressively in a good way into that space.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:29:43):**  It was very interesting.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:29:44):**  And one of the big leverage points that they have is by bringing their purchasing power  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:29:51):**  to the table.

**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:29:57):**  The way that we really think about it is this discussion that's being had around regenerative

**[0:30:12-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:30:12):**  In order to get it done at the scale that we think is possible, it's really about bringing  
**[0:30:19-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:30:19):**  all the stakeholders together and seeing the value of everyone at the table and really  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:30:26):**  listening to one another and understanding what those leverage points are.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:30:30):**  As we work together with our different organizations, there's an opportunity to really bring this  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:30:35):**  movement forward in a way that serves our businesses, that serves our livelihoods and  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:30:41):**  that serves the planet.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:30:42):**  That sounds great.

**[0:30:49-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:30:49):**  circles.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:30:50):**  But I want to focus a bit now on the company itself.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:30:52):**  So you've mentioned you're relatively young but at the same time are having all these  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:30:56):**  extremely interesting discussions with larger and smaller brands and a lot of farmers and  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:31:01):**  are planning to plant quite some trees this and next year.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:31:05):**  So if you look one year ago into your company but also the larger regenerative agriculture  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:31:11):**  space, what has changed since February 2017 and February 2018 as we're talking now?  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:31:17):**  Oh wow, that's a big question.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:31:21):**  I guess when we look back a year to a year ago and where the industry was, we were looking  
**[0:31:30-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:31:30):**  at an industry that was in a lot of ways still just beginning to organize around what was  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:31:37):**  occurring.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:31:38):**  And there's different industry leaders trying to forge the conversation forward.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:31:44):**  And it was still pretty young about a year ago but things have seemingly rapidly moved  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:31:48):**  over the past year, at least from what we've seen.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:31:51):**  As a company internally, about a year ago we were looking at a broad spectrum of different  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:31:56):**  solutions that may be leverage points for where we can bridge investment dollars in  
**[0:32:02-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:32:02):**  the space.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:32:04):**  And a year to today we've landed on what we think is a really good deployable solution  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:32:10):**  for investors.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:32:11):**  And we think a lot of the industry is starting to mature in that way, finding some standard  
**[0:32:15-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:32:15):**  operating procedures and standard operating metrics for what would make a successful industry  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:32:23):**  around regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:32:24):**  So we're pretty optimistic with the growth that we've seen in the last year.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:32:28):**  If we would take it one year further, so February 2019, what would you like to have achieved  
**[0:32:35-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:32:35):**  in terms of Propagate Ventures?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:32:38):**  This isn't a perfect world, right?  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:32:40):**  Yeah, you can dream, you can dream.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:32:44):**  I think that there's a few things.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:32:46):**  I think that right now there's a lot of scared, or I'm not sure if it's the wrong word, a  
**[0:32:52-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:32:52):**  lot of patient money waiting for solutions that help mitigate risk and increase liquidity  
**[0:33:00-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:33:00):**  into this market, into this new emerging kind of set of assets that help steward regeneration.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:33:09):**  I think in the next year we're going to really see some kind of us being, we think, a leader  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:33:16):**  in this, kind of some of these companies that have proved out their models and can bring  
**[0:33:22-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:33:22):**  investors a little bit more certainty to the table such that a little bit more of a wellspring  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:33:29):**  occurs where investors start to feel this is a more certain market for them to put their  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:33:33):**  money into, especially in the long term, because a lot of what we're talking about is 10 to  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:33:38):**  20 year investment cycles on some of these assets.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:33:43):**  So generally speaking, a year from now, what we think is going to be seen is a lot more  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:33:50):**  investor readiness to come to the table and help scale some of these solutions that we're  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:33:53):**  talking about.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:33:54):**  To add there, and then where we think we sit and where we see our value in the industry  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:33:59):**  is kind of to relate back to solar a bit.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:34:02):**  In the early days of solar, there was a lot of conversation around solar emerging as a  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:34:07):**  new asset class.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:34:08):**  Now we're pretty confident that the same can happen in regenerative agriculture and where  
**[0:34:15-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:34:15):**  it sits of where we are as a company is focused on agroforestry as an asset class within this  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:34:22):**  wider context of regeneration.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:34:25):**  And being one of the folks that can help bring that forward is something that we pride ourselves  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:34:31):**  on and definitely probably keeps us up at night, but also keeps us smiling during the  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:34:36):**  day.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:34:37):**  So how would it work as agroforestry, because it's a bit more focused on regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:34:43):**  as an asset class, if we look now we go way forward 10 years from now, how would it look  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:34:49):**  like as an asset class if I am an impact investor and I would like to have it in my portfolio  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:34:55):**  or maybe all the way throughout my portfolio?  
**[0:34:58-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:34:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:34:59):**  So the way in which we're kind of building this out in our company is as a fund model  
**[0:35:05-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:35:05):**  where deployments can be done across a multiple set, multiple sets of different asset types  
**[0:35:13-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:35:13):**  and crop types, some that are shorter term, faster term, and that provide not as big of  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:35:19):**  a return or a different type of return profile depending on the tree types that we're planting.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:35:26):**  And depending on the vehicle, whether they're focused on the debt side or the equity side  
**[0:35:31-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:35:31):**  to provide a little bit more diversity into what they might be able to choose their risk  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:35:35):**  allocation is.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:35:39):**  For us as an organization, really what that looks like is being able to raise a fund that  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:35:46):**  has pretty large scale for deployment because we're talking about managing trees over their  
**[0:35:51-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:35:51):**  lifespan and giving investors the ability to have stable returns at a competitive rate,  
**[0:35:59-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:35:59):**  whether that be something between 5 to 10% on their investment.

**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:36:12):**  The goal is to be able to do deployments in a more stable way so that we undercut a lot  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:36:19):**  of that risk through engaging a lot of stakeholders because we have the capital requirements to  
**[0:36:25-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:36:25):**  make those deployments possible.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:36:28):**  And that's bringing in brands and buyers at larger and larger levels across the supply  
**[0:36:32-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:36:32):**  by building subgroups like co-ops that will help with some of the buying infrastructure  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:36:38):**  in the middle at the ground level of production.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:36:44):**  So there's a whole slew of different structures that are built around the base structure of  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:36:51):**  a deployment model similar to solar.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:36:54):**  And what would that mean in terms of, because you have so many different tree types and  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:36:58):**  so many different products also coming out of that, would it all be mixed into the fund  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:04):**  to create that diversity and to create the maybe slightly earlier payouts, medium payouts  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:09):**  and later payouts because trees have obviously a different lifespan.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:13):**  Is that an idea to put that together and create a more stable thing for investors or you're  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:19):**  going to split it up because I'm very interested in chestnuts and you are very interested in  
**[0:37:23-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:23):**  apples and you're of interest in timber, for instance?  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:26):**  Yes, so the way in which we're starting currently, so kind of build you up to where we think  
**[0:37:31-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:31):**  we're going to go.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:32):**  Currently we're looking at direct investment opportunities in specific projects.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:37):**  So a project comes up and you're suggesting that to investors.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:41):**  Right, exactly.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:42):**  And we're building kind of direct investing vehicles that provide different variable terms  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:48):**  depending on what we're putting in the ground.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:51):**  That's kind of the initial stage that proves out how we're doing deployments.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:56):**  And how are investors responding to that?  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:37:58):**  Yeah, they're looking at it as a long-term investment.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:38:02):**  I think the current stage that we're at, a lot of investors are pushing towards fruit  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:38:07):**  production because it provides shorter returns, time horizons and higher return rates.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:38:13):**  But they're interested in it as a concept currently and are willing to play at a lower  
**[0:38:19-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:38:19):**  scale to prove it out.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:38:21):**  So we've got a lot of positive perception on that front.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:38:25):**  The long-term goal as we build out those portfolios is to be able to provide a fund layer that  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:38:32):**  works across both sides.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:38:36):**  And the reason why we think that makes a lot more sense currently than separating out the  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:38:39):**  different assets, whether it be different crop types or the debt or equity vehicles,  
**[0:38:44-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:38:44):**  is because it helps stabilize the risk and it helps the pool be a little bit more flexible.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:38:53):**  So that way we can deploy relative to the pipeline of projects that are coming in in  
**[0:38:59-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:38:59):**  a more stable manner.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:39:02):**  We've found that real asset funds are more interested in the bundle and having that as  
**[0:39:09-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:39:09):**  kind of an entirely managed portfolio than they are in separating it out and choosing.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:39:15):**  The size and scope that we're talking about, we think makes more sense with that combined.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:39:21):**  When we start to break it down to the project level, it becomes a little bit more risky  
**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:39:26):**  and we have to manage a lot more conversations.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:39:30):**  And the piece of this that we're finding is actually quite attractive is all the way on  
**[0:39:35-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:39:35):**  to the farm level, we're looking at diversification in terms of the farm system and then all the  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:39:42):**  way through to the investment piece, it's diversify your portfolio.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:39:47):**  So it's a lot of the similar thinking that takes play and it's a very virtuous cycle  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:39:52):**  that we think there's opportunity in.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:39:57):**  The end goal, say 10 to 20 years from now, there may arise opportunity for us to separate  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:05):**  those vehicles out to give exposure across different tree types.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:09):**  But that is yet to emerge as a viable option at this stage.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:13):**  It depends on scale.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:14):**  Of course.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:16):**  Each crop type has different skills, different levels of certainty.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:19):**  So we want to be able to provide broad spectrum at first before we start diving into one.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:25):**  In terms of giving investors the access to one specific vertical.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:29):**  And in terms of investors, because I know there's many of the farmland focused funds  
**[0:40:37-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:37):**  are looking at retail investors, they might want to go public at some point or they want  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:43):**  to bring in smaller scale investments, go to the crowdfunding or the crowd investing  
**[0:40:47-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:47):**  route.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:48):**  Is that something that you are thinking of and taking into account to keep this movement  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:53):**  or to make sure this regenerative agriculture movement is more democratized than maybe some  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:40:59):**  of the solar movement or especially the wind movement has been?  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:41:03):**  Yeah, it's a great question.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:41:05):**  So we actually, if we go back to the genesis of the organization, one of the primary goals  
**[0:41:12-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:41:12):**  was to lower the barrier to entry to being able to invest in this as an asset class.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:41:20):**  There's a great company that we like called Wonder Capital in solar that has done this  
**[0:41:25-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:41:25):**  pretty well.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:41:26):**  And we like it a little bit.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:41:29):**  We like the way in which they've approached this, which is there's still a minimum investment  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:41:33):**  quantity that a person can put in.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:41:37):**  But it's small enough that it's accessible to investors that are not necessarily large  
**[0:41:45-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:41:45):**  scale.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:41:46):**  And we kind of have a similar thinking.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:41:48):**  We view this as a viable option for that model and crowdfunding it within that framework.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:41:56):**  I think we're being a little bit cautious to make sure we're not over promising and  
**[0:42:01-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:42:01):**  under delivering across this.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:42:02):**  Because the last thing we want to do is start selling to smaller level retail investors  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:42:09):**  before we've proven out that it works at a scale that's investable.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:42:13):**  Of course, you don't want to run that risk, especially as it's so early in the regenerative  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:42:21):**  agriculture space, or at least in the vehicles that are investing in regenerative agriculture  
**[0:42:25-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:42:25):**  space.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:42:26):**  Is that one of the main barriers you see, that the barrier to entry for investors is  
**[0:42:31-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:42:31):**  relatively high?  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:42:33):**  What I've heard in some of these interviews is the minimum is relatively high, which means  
**[0:42:38-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:42:38):**  you're by definition speaking to a very small group and that limits the amount of people  
**[0:42:45-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:42:45):**  that get enthusiastic, obviously.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:42:47):**  Yeah, I think you're totally right on that.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:42:50):**  And the cost of acquiring the capital is also very high.  
**[0:42:54-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:42:54):**  So you're going to have a little bit of a problem in the early stage where you have  
**[0:43:01-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:43:01):**  to kind of...  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:43:03):**  Everyone that's trying to get money from a very small group of investors who are interested  
**[0:43:07-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/jeremy-kaufman-harry-greene-ethan-steinberg/#t=0:43:07):**  in catalyzing this movement are all in some ways competing for those dollars.

### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 17 May 2022 17:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:14):**  Imagine if you could, with a single or a few samples of water collected downstream in a  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:18):**  watershed, map all of the biodiversity in that watershed.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:22):**  Instead of sending teams to survey the different bird species placing camera traps hoping that  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:27):**  you capture these crucial species, you can use environmental DNA to map all of the species  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:32):**  from bacteria to blue whales.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:34):**  And if you do that regularly, you can actually see if the biodiversity is increasing or decreasing.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:39):**  This is already possible around mining areas and conservation areas.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:42):**  And imagine applying this to landscapes full of agriculture.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:46):**  And what if we add soil sampling and even more cutting edge air sampling to monitor  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:50):**  the biodiversity in a landscape?  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:54):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:00:58):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:00):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:04):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:09):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:14):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:16):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:20-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:20):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:23):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:28):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:32):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:36-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:36):**  our work.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:37):**  And so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:39):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:43):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:56-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:56):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:01:58):**  Welcome to another episode today with the head of nature, positive supply chains at  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:02):**  nature metrics, the home of cutting edge biodiversity monitoring powerful, scalable biodiversity  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:06):**  data delivered safely and sustainably using DNA from bacteria to blue whales.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:11):**  They monitor biodiversity in context ranging from conservation to environmental impact  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:16):**  assessments.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:17):**  Welcome, Kath.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:18):**  Hi, great to be here.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:19):**  And shout out, first of all, to Paul Chatterton who mentioned nature metrics that I didn't  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:24):**  know about yet.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:25):**  A shame on me, obviously, and got very, very interested in what you are doing in the conservation  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:30):**  space and starting to look at the agriculture space.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:33):**  So we'll unpack all of that, what it means, they're using DNA, what it means, the water  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:37):**  side, how can you measure blue whales and all of that.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:40):**  But let's start with a personal question.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:42):**  How did you end up going this deep into biodiversity?  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:45):**  So I think my whole life has really been around biodiversity and nature.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:50):**  As a kid, I loved being around animals, being outside.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:02:55):**  I grew up in New Zealand where we have amazing biodiversity on our doorstep.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:00):**  And really as I grew up, it was what I wanted to do as a career choice.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:04):**  I sort of studied zoology at university and then really became aware of the challenges  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:10):**  that the world's nature is facing and decided that that was what I wanted to do with my  
**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:15):**  life.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:16):**  I wanted to try and help restore nature, biodiversity, to make sure that we were going to have something  
**[0:03:24-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:24):**  around for future generations.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:26):**  There are many different paths that you could have, even in that specific, let's say, Tree  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:30):**  of Life branch, you could have taken and you ended up working at a very exciting startup.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:35):**  What was the journey like?  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:36):**  It wasn't straight to that.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:37):**  You've worked in many different places.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:39):**  How did you decide at some point to maybe not stay in academia, but actually to join  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:44):**  the corporate world or to join the commercial world and then ending up at a startup where  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:49):**  life is not always easy and quite exciting, but also quite challenging, I can imagine,  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:54):**  compared to you being in a university somewhere and studying super interesting biodiversity  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:58):**  stuff, obviously in New Zealand.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:03:59):**  I mean, there are places you can spend your whole life studying stuff there, but you decided  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:03):**  to move.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:05):**  So I started off in academia and I love research, but there was this growing frustration about  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:11):**  the fact that academic research, so much of it just goes and sits on a dusty shelf and  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:17):**  nobody reads it or uses it.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:19):**  There's this huge disconnect between the practitioners and the people that really need the evidence  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:25):**  and the researchers that are producing it.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:28):**  For me, it just feels like sometimes a really inefficient way to create impact.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:34):**  You spend years and years trying to answer one very specific question.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:39):**  You then spend years trying to get that published as an academic article that nobody reads.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:46):**  So I really wanted to do something that was driving change on the ground a little bit  
**[0:04:51-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:51):**  more.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:52):**  So then I moved more into the conservation sector, working with NGOs, with practical  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:56):**  projects on the ground.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:04:57):**  And again, that was great, but I wanted to try and drive impact at a slightly bigger  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:05:03):**  scale and I was just really conscious through the work that I was doing of the impact that  
**[0:05:09-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:05:09):**  the private sector was having on biodiversity, but also the power that they had to change.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:05:17):**  So you can see that they can be so nimble, when they're motivated, the private sector  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:05:22):**  can change at a much faster pace than policy can change, for example, and through that  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:05:28):**  they can have massive impact.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:05:30):**  So that was when I started to work more closely with corporates on helping them understand  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:05:35):**  how they could start to measure their impacts on biodiversity and then manage those impacts.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:05:41):**  And when you were in academia, I imagine, I've never worked in academia, but it's relatively  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:05:47):**  easy to stay there for a long time.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:05:49):**  Like once you're in, you can stay there for a long time.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:05:51):**  You said, no, there was this growing frustration with time as well, like not the most efficient  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:05:56):**  way of creating impact.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:05:58):**  Was that a slowly growing thing or was there one example like, okay, I spent four years  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:06:02):**  studying this one bacteria and then it didn't get published or something like that?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:06:06):**  Was there a slow process to say, okay, I need to go out of academia?  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:06:10):**  Or was there one moment that at some point, okay, this is enough and now let's do something  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:06:15):**  else?  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:06:16):**  I don't think there was a single moment, but it was working more with communities on the  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:06:21):**  ground.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:06:22):**  I worked with an amazing project working in West Africa in a protected area.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:06:30):**  And it's just that disconnect between the practical tools that local communities need  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:06:37):**  to enact change on the ground and the kind of questions that you're answering with some  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:06:42):**  research project conducted by predominantly Western scientists on the other side of the  
**[0:06:47-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:06:47):**  world.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:06:48):**  But also, you sort of mentioned that you could get comfortable in academia.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:06:54):**  I think it's really hard for people entering that career space now.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:06:59):**  There's much less job security.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:01):**  It's driven by grant funding.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:03):**  Grant funding is really competitive, which in itself is a really inefficient use of resources.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:08):**  You spend a huge amount of time and energy chasing grant money with, you know, 1% chance  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:13):**  of success.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:15):**  So just the whole system.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:17):**  Sounds like fundraising.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:19):**  Even worse.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:21):**  It's a bit like fundraising, but yeah, it's such potluck.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:24):**  So I sort of felt like there was better ways I could be spending my time.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:27):**  And then in the corporate space, at what point did you sort of notice that the tools were  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:34):**  missing or the tools maybe were there, but not adequate, not cheap enough, not accessible  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:39):**  enough or not specific enough, or maybe too specific.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:42):**  What was that process?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:43):**  And then of course joining nature metrics, which you're going to unpack, but what was  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:46):**  there like, okay, there's actually something to do on the tool side and on the practical,  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:50):**  like the shelves and ordered off this sector and not necessarily also, but we first need  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:07:56):**  to get the tools better to start asking much bigger questions about how to change those  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:00):**  supply chains and have those impacts impacts on the road or down the watershed.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:05):**  So my work with corporates is really focused on companies with supply chain.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:09):**  So their impacts on nature are really concentrated at the production of the raw materials that  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:15):**  they're purchasing.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:17):**  So that tends to be agriculture.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:19):**  So we see in the space of kind of corporates and biodiversity.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:22):**  So the extractive sector, for example, is quite well advanced in how they measure their  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:28):**  impacts on biodiversity, but that's partly because they make a lot of money out of a  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:32):**  small area of land.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:33):**  And there's also a lot more regulation around it.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:35):**  Meaning the mining sector, anything that literally takes stuff out of the ground is usually,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:41):**  I mean, even though they're big, it usually are relatively concentrated on around and  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:45):**  in the mine.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:46):**  And there's a lot of regulation around what they can dump into, so water use, et cetera.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:52):**  Like they're under a lot of scrutiny compared to some other, also extractive sectors that  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:08:56):**  maybe they dig a bit less deep, like a lot of the players in the agriculture space.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:01):**  So the mining sector, I mean, also infrastructure.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:03):**  So people building things.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:06):**  Those sort of sectors, they've got a much longer history of trying to understand their  
**[0:09:11-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:11):**  impacts on biodiversity.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:12):**  But like I say, they've got the money to spend on it.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:15):**  So they can send out teams of surveyors to these places, to these technical experts that  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:22):**  can go out in the field and identify birds and mammals and fish.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:27):**  So how does that work?  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:28):**  Let's say I own a mine in, let's say in West Africa and I need to, because of regulation  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:33):**  and because of my own policy, assess the impact on biodiversity.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:36):**  I fly in a team.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:37):**  Is that what I'm hearing from you?  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:39):**  Like how does that work and what do they do?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:40):**  Like how should I imagine that process currently works or used to work or currently works if  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:45):**  I want to understand my impact of this mine on biodiversity?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:49):**  So I'm not an expert in the sector, but yes.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:51):**  So in general, they'll start off with environmental impact assessment.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:55):**  You'll normally have some sort of desk-based assessment where you're kind of trying to  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:09:58):**  understand what the risk is.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:10:00):**  Is this mine in an area with lots of endangered and protected species and important habitat?  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:10:06):**  But then yeah, absolutely, you will need experts in the field.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:10:10):**  And sometimes they may have access to local experts, but a lot of the time they won't.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:10:15):**  And so they will be flying in teams of people who have expertise to go out and survey these  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:10:22):**  sites for different birds, et cetera.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:10:25):**  So they go around and spend weeks in the areas for quite a few days, I'm imagining, to survey  
**[0:10:31-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:10:31):**  and to capture the biodiversity, the full scale, which is super difficult and very expensive,  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:10:38):**  I'm imagining.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:10:39):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:10:40):**  So you can imagine that when you then think about a different sector like agriculture,  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:10:46):**  it's just not feasible.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:10:48):**  You can't send out teams of experts to a farm where the profits that you're making out of  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:10:54):**  a hectare are just a fraction of what a mining company is going to be making out of the same  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:10:59):**  area of land.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:01):**  So the challenge that I was working with with supply chain companies, how do you create  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:06):**  a scalable way of monitoring your impact on biodiversity when you potentially have thousands  
**[0:11:13-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:13):**  of suppliers and, you know, thousands of suppliers who are producing commodities but aren't making  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:21):**  huge margins off that.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:23):**  And there's also not that same regulation, regulatory incentive to spend lots of money  
**[0:11:28-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:28):**  on this biodiversity monitoring.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:30):**  And so what was the solution you came up with or one of the solutions?  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:34):**  What was the direction in going, okay, we cannot fly in teams of people and send them  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:37):**  two weeks into farm areas or whole watersheds to start surveying the amount of birds and  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:43):**  the amount of insect wildlife and use it as a proxy to see what's happening.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:46):**  That would be amazing in many cases, but it's also incomplete and very, very expensive.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:50):**  So that's not an option.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:52):**  What are other, I mean, people talk about satellite, remote sensing, sensors, etc.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:56):**  But you took a different route to a potential solution.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:11:59):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:12:01):**  So remote sensing is a great option, but it doesn't really let you see individual species.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:12:07):**  You can't necessarily see biodiversity from space.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:12:12):**  So that was when I came across NatureMetrics, which surveys biodiversity by looking at the  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:12:19):**  DNA that species leave behind in the environment.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:12:23):**  So it's a bit like crime scene forensics but for animals.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:12:27):**  So we can collect through samples of water or soil and even air.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:12:33):**  You can collect a sample and then we can process that in the lab and look for these little  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:12:37):**  fragments of DNA that species have left behind.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:12:42):**  And the thing that really appealed to me is that I love spending times in nature.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:12:48):**  I love watching animals and birds, but I'm a terrible field biologist.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:12:53):**  Why are we just so terrible?  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:12:55):**  What does a good field biologist look like and why would you be a terrible one?  
**[0:12:59-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:12:59):**  Well, so for example, I spent a lot of time working with ornithologists, so bird experts,  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:07):**  and a lot of time working with the data sets that they produce.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:11):**  But these are people that can go out in the field and they can identify a bird species  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:15):**  by song, normally from quite some distance away.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:19):**  And they can only tell you where 10, 20, 30 meters away that bird is.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:26):**  And to me, I can't do that.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:28):**  But it sounds like something that we can do.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:30):**  Let's say if you would record that, in this case, it would be audio waves, obviously,  
**[0:13:35-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:35):**  like a computer would be able to tell you as well.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:38):**  We can train software to do that at some point.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:40):**  I'm not sure.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:41):**  But the acoustic space feels like something, okay, I would, we're recording this now.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:46):**  So I'm in my simple mind thinking, okay, that's a fixable thing.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:49):**  But it's only a very small part of the biodiversity of the place to capture that, analyze that.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:54):**  And then, but you're saying we're capturing, we're doing water samples, air samples,  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:13:58):**  and soil samples, and then give you almost a full spectrum of what has been living and  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:03):**  now has let something go, which could be poop, which could be other DNA, which could be a  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:07):**  lot of different things, has been living upstream, or at least where the wind or the water came  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:12):**  from.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:13):**  And that's, I think, the interesting piece, you're saying 10, 20 meters.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:16):**  But in this case, if you do this analysis, it can be a much larger area that you can  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:20):**  sample with a few samples only.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:22):**  Yeah, potentially.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:23):**  So acoustics is another fantastic technology.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:26):**  And there are some really amazing people working on that.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:29):**  But as you say, with, so we call it environmental DNA.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:33):**  So that's the fragments of DNA that animals are leaving behind in the environment.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:37):**  So with eDNA, we can sample like the whole diversity of life.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:42):**  So we can look from bacteria to blue whales, I think, as we mentioned earlier.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:48):**  And for me, what's really exciting about DNA is that it gives us this really unbiased view  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:56):**  of the ecosystem.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:14:58):**  So a lot of these traditional surveys led by technical experts in the field, they're  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:03):**  focused on those really charismatic species.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:06):**  So the birds and the chimpanzees and elephants and…  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:11):**  And even in the birds, maybe the ones we know the song of, the ones we don't know, we  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:15):**  are not even captured, I'm imagining.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:17):**  Bird experts would probably know, be able to cover everything that was in the relevant  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:21):**  local environment.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:22):**  But whilst, you know, those charismatic species are the things that we really connect to and  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:28):**  think about when we think about nature, that is not necessarily the biodiversity that's  
**[0:15:33-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:33):**  fundamental to…  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:34):**  There's not necessarily the biodiversity that's fundamental to a functioning ecosystem.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:41):**  So that's not necessarily the biodiversity that is really underpinning our economic systems.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:46):**  Which would be the bacteria, the insects, like the non-sexy ones, basically are the  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:51):**  ones we actually should be… and we're not following them.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:54):**  Which is that we have no really good like overview in many places, like many conservation  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:15:59):**  areas, but also many farms for sure.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:02):**  Most of it is sort of in the dark.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:03):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:04):**  So the soil microbiome is fundamental to global agriculture.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:10):**  You know, without a functioning microbiome, we don't have crops.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:14):**  But we know just, you know, a tiny amount about the bacteria and the fungi and the insects  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:22):**  that are living in the soil and how different combinations of different species are important  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:27):**  for making crops grow.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:29):**  And so how did you end up then…  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:32):**  So you found NatureMetrics you mentioned, and then now I think it's time to go.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:35):**  What is NatureMetrics doing analyzing this eDNA?  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:39):**  And what does it tell?  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:40):**  Like what are typical clients you work with or customers you work with?  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:43):**  Typical use cases where you might be measuring the blue whales or the bacteria or both.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:48):**  And so what should people imagine?  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:49):**  Okay, it's not, we're not sending a huge team listening to the song of birds, but we're  
**[0:16:54-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:54):**  doing something else and we're getting a different image or maybe a better or more  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:16:57):**  accurate or more relevant image of the area we want to survey.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:02):**  So we have a huge range of clients.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:03):**  So as I mentioned previously, a lot of our work is with the extractors sector, so mining  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:10):**  companies, infrastructure, so property developers.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:14):**  And what we're doing in those sectors is we're replacing the need to send out these  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:19):**  huge teams of technical experts to the field.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:21):**  You're not making friends with that, I think, because this used to be, I think for a lot  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:25):**  of these technical experts also, I'm not saying nice trips, but important trips and  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:29):**  relevant trips, but yeah, you're undercutting them probably by a significant amount in terms  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:34):**  of price.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:35):**  And I mean, yeah.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:36):**  So you still need people out in the field, but I think one of the fantastic things about  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:40):**  what we do is that anybody can take a sample.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:44):**  You don't need to be an expert to take a sample.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:46):**  So how do you take a sample?  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:47):**  Walk us through visually, because of course we're an audio.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:50):**  If I want to take a sample, how would it work?  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:53):**  So for example, probably our most developed kits are our water kits.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:17:58):**  And so with that, you collect a few liters of water in a bag that we supply.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:06):**  And then we have a little disk, which is a filter, which captures the DNA.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:12):**  And then you use a syringe, you syringe up the water, and then you just push it through  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:17):**  the filter.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:18):**  It's just a small round disk, maybe five centimeters in diameter.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:25):**  And you will push a few liters of water through the disk.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:29):**  And then that's it.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:30):**  That's your DNA sample.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:31):**  You pop it in the envelope and you send it back to our labs.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:34):**  And we then process that in the lab.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:37):**  And so I don't have to send water, which probably logistically makes it a lot easier.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:41):**  And then you set a few liters, like in a normal circumstances, what kind of area can I cover  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:48):**  with it?  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:49):**  Or how often should I do it if I'm running a mine of, I don't know, 50 hectares or something?  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:53):**  Like what, it depends on the terrain, obviously, but should I do many samples or is it relatively,  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:18:59):**  like the ratio of one disk, like how big is the ratio that I should normally consider?  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:04):**  Of course it depends.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:05):**  It's sort of a million dollar question of how many samples is enough.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:10):**  And I can't give you an answer to that because it really depends on the question you're trying  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:14):**  to answer and the context.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:16):**  What would I like to see?  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:18):**  Like how much do you miss in one, in a few liters of water?  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:20):**  So how sure do you want to be that you've sampled all the biodiversity in the area?  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:25):**  You need a slightly more intensive sampling approach than a, I'm just interested to know  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:30):**  generally what's here.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:32):**  And then the next step is kind of do you want to be able to track changes through time?  
**[0:19:37-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:37):**  But in general, you can sample at a much lower field work effort than you would with a traditional  
**[0:19:44-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:44):**  survey approach.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:46):**  And if you're thinking about things like water catchments, it can be a really effective way  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:51):**  of sampling biodiversity at that catchment scale because the DNA does of course move  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:56):**  with the water.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:19:57):**  So if you're sampling downstream, you are capturing some of the biodiversity from upstream  
**[0:20:02-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:02):**  as well.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:03):**  And you've seen surprises in there, right?  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:04):**  In conservation areas where people thought, I think Paul mentioned at Chatterton that  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:09):**  certain things were more extinct or didn't, were living anymore in that part of the river  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:14):**  system and only in the other part and actually the DNA showed that they were absolutely also  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:18):**  living in other areas than we thought until now.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:21):**  Because of course if you have very thick jungle, for example, yeah, we can only go so far with  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:25):**  the search teams and the DNA doesn't lie.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:28):**  Like if it's there, it had to be upstream in the watershed somewhere.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:31):**  It's not that it just comes, it doesn't go up upstream by itself.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:36):**  We've had some great examples of species that are new to an area that we've rediscovered.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:41):**  But I think one of my favorite examples is the pygmy hippo, which is, as you might guess,  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:49):**  it's a tiny hippo.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:51):**  It lives in West Africa.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:52):**  It's incredibly rare and endangered.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:20:56):**  I worked on this conservation project in Sierra Leone and we knew there were pygmy hippos  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:00):**  around this national park.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:02):**  But you could, I mean people that had lived adjacent to that national park their whole  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:08):**  lives had never seen the pygmy hippos.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:11):**  And we spent a huge amount of money on putting up camera traps and doing all sorts of surveys  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:17):**  to try and find these pygmy hippos.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:18):**  You know, and you might get one photo across thousands of nights worth of camera trapping  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:25):**  effort.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:26):**  And then when you use an eDNA approach, you can just take samples of the water and there  
**[0:21:32-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:32):**  are pygmy hippos all over the place.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:33):**  Can you see how many as well?  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:35):**  Or you can maybe see over time if it increases or decreases.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:39):**  Like how likely is it that this DNA mixes like in water in terms of like it gets picked  
**[0:21:44-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:44):**  up?  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:45):**  Probably that's research you're doing now.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:46):**  Like what is the ratio of missing things versus capturing it even if you like, how big was  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:51):**  this watershed and how many samples did you have to do?  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:54):**  Or was it literally, like you said, a few liters and we understood that in this national  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:21:57):**  park or around it actually were quite a few pygmy hippos.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:22:01):**  So it was more than a couple of liters to find these particular pygmy hippos.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:22:08):**  And this particular project was in Liberia.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:22:12):**  So you can't directly equate the… we sort of look at more presence absence of animals.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:22:19):**  So sometimes if you have a greater amount of DNA in your sample, that tends to correlate  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:22:24):**  quite well with abundance, but it's not a one to one ratio.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:22:29):**  It's not a gram to pygmy hippo ratio.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:22:32):**  No, that will be too… but you know the direction.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:22:35):**  Like if they suddenly disappear or the quantity starts increasing over time in multiple samples,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:22:40):**  I mean there's an indication of something is happening.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:22:43):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:22:45):**  Especially if you're going back to the same place at the same time of year to repeat the  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:22:49):**  sampling and looking at the same species, then that gives you a great way of looking  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:22:53):**  at trends.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:22:54):**  And we also within Nature Metrics have a fantastic team of data scientists who are working on  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:01):**  amazing modeling techniques which help translate that kind of… that one or two or hopefully  
**[0:23:07-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:07):**  more samples into what is the likelihood that we missed a species that was actually there.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:14):**  And what have you done any work around the agriculture part of this?  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:18):**  Because runoff is a huge issue.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:21):**  As I said before, somebody…  
**[0:23:22-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:22):**  I don't remember which farmer said it.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:24):**  It's probably the best way to analyze a farmer to know if a farm is going in the right  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:27):**  direction or not is to analyze the water that leaves the farm at the lowest point on the  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:33):**  farm.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:34):**  But of course these are also extractive industries but not as profitable as certain other ones.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:39):**  So have you done any work in agriculture and if not, why and how can we fix that?  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:43):**  So agriculture is an emerging sector for us.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:46):**  So we can see lots of potential applications of the technology.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:51):**  So as you mentioned, we can look at water quality.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:23:56):**  So there are groups of particular species that are really good indicators of whether  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:24:01):**  water is polluted or not polluted.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:24:05):**  So what we're working on at the moment is how do we turn our kind of list of species  
**[0:24:11-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:24:11):**  into useful metrics that can then inform decision making.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:24:18):**  So freshwater pollution indices are a great application of our technology.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:24:25):**  But of course in soil, I think the most exciting thing is looking at the soil microbiome.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:24:31):**  So with a small sample of soil, we can look at the bacteria, the fungi and the invertebrates  
**[0:24:37-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:24:37):**  that are living in that soil and start to understand how that correlates with a healthy  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:24:47):**  or regenerative soil.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:24:48):**  And you mentioned probably our water part is the most developed.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:24:52):**  What is different when you're analysing soil and could you be analysing soil also indirectly  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:24:57):**  through water that is runoff that went through the soil?  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:00):**  How different is that approach if we say, okay, we want to analyse a few litres of water  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:04):**  and if we do that in a number of places, it gives us a good idea of the watershed, which  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:08):**  sounds like huge in soil.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:10):**  I don't know.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:11):**  It feels immediately to me that, okay, we have to do more of that because it's more  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:15):**  local.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:16):**  Is that a right thought or how different would soil sampling or soil analytics be compared  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:21):**  to water?  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:22):**  Yeah, which also sounds amazing, but I don't know how, I cannot even imagine how to do  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:25):**  that.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:26):**  So, yeah, you're right.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:27):**  I think the biodiversity in the soil is not moving in the same way that the DNA in a waterway  
**[0:25:33-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:33):**  is.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:34):**  So you need a different sampling approach.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:36):**  So if you want to characterise the microbiome of a field, you would want to take probably  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:42):**  multiple samples of that field.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:45):**  Or if you are not that worried about the variation within a field, you just want to kind of to  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:52):**  know in general what the microbiome looks like across that field.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:55):**  You can use lots of sub samples.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:25:57):**  So you take lots of sub samples across your field, a bit like you might do for chemical  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:01):**  sampling, mix it all together and then you kind of get an average result.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:07):**  And then do you need to, because you cannot push it through a filter, like then you need  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:10):**  to run water through it to sort of dissolve.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:12):**  So how does it work?  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:14):**  So we don't use a filter for the soil samples.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:17):**  You would literally send us a small few grams of soil and that's what we would analyse in  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:23):**  the lab.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:24):**  And would, I mean, how different is that result or would that result be compared to, for instance,  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:30):**  after a rainy day, taking a bit of the runoff water from a field, would they be able to  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:34):**  tell us fundamentally different things or would you say no, the soil sampling is in  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:38):**  this case better, more complete or because as we see with the conservation side, like  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:44):**  this bacteria or the DNA left over, they travel with water.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:48):**  How would that differ or it's not such a relevant approach to look at that low, like the water  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:53):**  running off from a farm or travel through a farm?  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:26:55):**  I think it would depend on your question, but I think runoff, you wouldn't get the same,  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:00):**  you wouldn't get a very accurate representation of kind of the soil on the field from which  
**[0:27:06-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:06):**  the runoff came, I guess.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:08):**  And then air, how would air or how does air work?  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:11):**  Like an air sample.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:12):**  I mean, I can imagine you open a pot and you close it, but that's probably not the approach.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:16):**  So this is cutting edge.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:18):**  That's what I want to know.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:20):**  So this is probably a great example actually, going right back to academia.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:25):**  I mean, NatureMetrics work is founded off the back of, so our founder Kat Bruce, she  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:33):**  did her PhD on meta barcoding, which is what we call, that's what we call when you're processing  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:39):**  a sample and looking at lots of species, looking for all the species in that sample.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:45):**  So really, NatureMetrics was founded on the idea of, well, we've done cool science, but  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:51):**  we really need to find a way to apply it and have impact.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:54):**  So air DNA is complete cutting edge.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:27:58):**  It's work that we're looking at in collaboration with academics that are leading on this.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:04):**  The idea is that you have some sort of suction system to filter the air itself, but it's  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:11):**  the same idea.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:12):**  I mean, we know that DNA exists all around us.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:15):**  We're all shedding DNA the whole time.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:17):**  Animals are no exception.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:18):**  We can capture that.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:21):**  Animals and trees and plants, et cetera, although probably in water, it's, I wouldn't say easier,  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:26):**  but it moves downstream.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:27):**  Like you sort of know where it comes from and where it didn't come from before.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:31):**  But of course it could be influenced by rain, it could be influenced by many, many other  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:34):**  things.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:35):**  Now I'm just thinking that it's not that easy, but air feels like it just moves randomly.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:39):**  So how do you contribute that to a place or a biome or a watershed?  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:45):**  But then it probably tells you a lot more different things if you're able to do that.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:49):**  So sure, air is going to move and water moves, but the reality is that you still get a much  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:55):**  stronger signal from things that are in their immediate environment.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:28:59):**  So you're much more likely to pick up the person standing right next to the filter than  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:29:04):**  you are, the rhinoceros that's 20 kilometres away.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:29:08):**  True.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:29:09):**  And so you said agriculture for us is an emerging space.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:29:13):**  What needs to happen?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:29:14):**  What would be an ideal agriculture client in the space?  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:29:17):**  Could be of course a large food company or something, but if somebody is listening, what  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:29:21):**  they should imagine as an ideal case to push the boundaries or to be on the cutting edge  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:29:26):**  to do maybe both air and water or soil and air, etc.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:29:30):**  What would really excite you on the agriculture side, on the soil side?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:29:34):**  So I think we're really interested in soil sampling in the agriculture context and working  
**[0:29:40-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:29:40):**  with people that can help us translate the data that we get into meaningful metrics.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:29:48):**  So the soil microbiome, it's not just a list of species.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:29:51):**  You don't get a list of 20 birds or whatever.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:29:54):**  It's thousands of bacteria and fungi and invertebrates and turning that into something meaningful  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:30:01):**  is much more difficult.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:30:04):**  And it can really depend, right?  
**[0:30:05-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:30:05):**  I mean the ideal ratio of bacteria to fungi in one cropping system might be different  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:30:16):**  for a different cropping system or soil type.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:30:19):**  So what we're really interested in is just testing out the approach in as many different  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:30:24):**  contexts as possible.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:30:28):**  What I'm particularly interested in though is how do we create a scalable monitoring  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:30:35):**  system for the agricultural space.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:30:39):**  So it has to be a different business model to how we operate with extractives because  
**[0:30:44-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:30:44):**  you're not making millions of dollars out of a field.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:30:51):**  Except maybe a few small areas where we make very particular collective wines for collectors.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:30:57):**  But the rest of the industry unfortunately is not operating on those margins.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:31:01):**  So it has to shift from, it has to be a different approach is what you're saying.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:31:06):**  And so what I'm really interested in is we have all these big corporates who are dependent  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:31:12):**  on agricultural outputs and they're making big commitments to things like regenerative  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:31:17):**  agriculture.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:31:19):**  How they're implementing those commitments, how they're supporting the suppliers, sometimes  
**[0:31:24-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:31:24):**  a little bit opaque.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:31:26):**  What I'm really interested in is bringing the corporate players to the field level to  
**[0:31:33-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:31:33):**  push them to develop the measurement approaches they need to really evidence the claims that  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:31:40):**  they're making and hopefully supporting their producers.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:31:46):**  And for that I think we need a different scale of approach to monitoring.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:31:54):**  And where I think DNA has real value is, you know we were talking about water catchment.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:31:59):**  So monitoring biodiversity at the scale of water catchment.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:32:03):**  So can we do that at the same scale for agriculture?  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:32:08):**  So can we start to monitor biodiversity at the landscape scale?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:32:12):**  So rather than having the onus on an individual farmer to fund the measurement approach himself,  
**[0:32:19-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:32:19):**  we look at the bigger picture, we get people to co-invest in the measurement and we look  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:32:28):**  at kind of measuring those outcomes at a much larger scale.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:32:32):**  So sort of thinking along the lines of, you know we see landscape and jurisdictional approaches  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:32:37):**  developing as solutions to sustainable commodity production.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:32:42):**  So let's kind of harness that model and see if we can deploy biodiversity monitoring as  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:32:48):**  part of those programs.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:32:50):**  And let's say you have a landscape where one or two or multiple corporates are buying a  
**[0:32:56-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:32:56):**  considerable amount.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:32:58):**  So there's an influence, there's an interest to monitor.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:01):**  How would you approach it to figure out where to sample?  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:05):**  How do you pick like, okay, we don't work on a farm level so we can pick any farm or  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:09):**  any spot on a farm.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:10):**  How do you normally approach that as well?  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:12):**  But how would you do that in agriculture?  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:14):**  Okay, what we have three ways of sampling where to do what and why, how difficult is  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:19):**  that on a, but if you have the whole landscape and there's somebody paying for it, is it  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:22):**  then still very tricky to figure out, okay, we have to be there, there and there.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:26):**  And that point probably is not so essential to measure, but it would be nice.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:29):**  Like how do you prioritize with like, you could, of course you only have limited resources,  
**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:34):**  now that you can do 10,000 sampling.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:36):**  So how do you prioritize the spots where you catch air, water and or so?  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:41):**  So I think that's probably what we're really looking for partners for the opportunity to  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:47):**  test out.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:48):**  I mean, there are kind of rules of thumb.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:51):**  I mean, you know, you can look at your landscape, you can look at the different crop types and  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:33:56):**  landscape types and habitat types, and you can, you know, break those up and you can  
**[0:34:02-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:34:02):**  sample a bit in those different types of areas.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:34:05):**  But it also is driven very much on the kind of information whoever's funding and undertaking  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:34:11):**  the measurement wants to get out of it.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:34:14):**  Do the farmers want meaningful information that might inform their farm management?  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:34:19):**  Then we probably need to look at, you know, perhaps more intensive sampling at the field  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:34:24):**  level with soil.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:34:27):**  The corporates not so interested in that, but they want something to tell them about  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:34:32):**  how they're improving charismatic species across the landscape.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:34:36):**  Then we might look to use the water sampling, for example.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:34:41):**  So I should have said, water is great because you don't just pick up the species living  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:34:45):**  in the water, you pick up a lot of the species living around and interacting with that water.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:34:51):**  Not just the hippos, but also the birds.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:34:54):**  But it's a much wider net and doesn't tell you specific on a field level, obviously,  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:34:57):**  like what's, if the field is moving forward or not, and if it's improving.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:35:02):**  And then of course you might have in a landscape also the conservation areas where there's  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:35:05):**  a different need as well to what to communicate and what you want to learn.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:35:10):**  But I think that, I mean, we keep coming back to that on the podcast as well.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:35:13):**  The landscape approach is absolutely essential, not just for the biodiversity measurement,  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:35:19):**  but in general, because you want to be changing your practices and improving your land if  
**[0:35:24-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:35:24):**  you're a farmer in a landscape that's also moving forward, because otherwise you're  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:35:27):**  really fighting against way too much.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:35:30):**  So that seems to be, keeps coming back as an absolutely crucial piece of the puzzle.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:35:34):**  For me, I think it's a really practical way of taking corporate engagement in agricultural  
**[0:35:44-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:35:44):**  sustainability forward, particularly around the context of biodiversity in nature, because  
**[0:35:52-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:35:52):**  biodiversity is not the same as carbon.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:35:54):**  A ton of carbon is the same whether it's released in Brazil versus America, whereas  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:35:59):**  the impact you're going to have on biodiversity is going to be very different depending on  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:36:03):**  your sourcing, your ton of soy from Brazil versus America.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:36:07):**  So context is really important, but of course these global multinationals who are making  
**[0:36:14-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:36:14):**  all these commitments to regenerative agriculture, very few of them have traceability to the  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:36:20):**  site level.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:36:21):**  They're not working with individual farmers.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:36:25):**  So I see a key way for them to engage in this space is at that landscape scale, because  
**[0:36:30-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:36:30):**  they will know, well we know we are sourcing soy from the Sahara in Brazil, or cocoa from  
**[0:36:37-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:36:37):**  Cote d'Ivoire.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:36:39):**  So they know the landscapes that they're operating in, and I think that's kind of  
**[0:36:43-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:36:43):**  the right spatial scale for them to engage in sustainability initiatives.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:36:48):**  Yeah, and then it becomes much more practical as well to, and it is part of that decommodification  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:36:55):**  that you are working in a landscape, something you can just switch and go to some cheaper  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:00):**  soy somewhere else, which happens a lot, but the whole process of decommodifying it means  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:04):**  you have longer ties to the same traders and to the indirectly to the same farmers, and  
**[0:37:09-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:09):**  you want to make sure that that is moving forward.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:11):**  And let's say in terms of costs, I'm imagining it's much more bearable to be bearable for  
**[0:37:15-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:15):**  the large corporates.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:16):**  Like if you want to, because a lot of them are making huge commitments on carbon as well,  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:21):**  and it requires a lot of sampling to say something irrelevant about it.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:25):**  Of course, there's a lot of sensing, but it has its limits.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:28):**  Like this is an easy add on to that, like in terms of cost to monitor biodiversity.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:32):**  And I guess it's, would it be easy to add it to these kinds of projects because the  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:36):**  cost is there, but relatively limited or also there we have to work to bring down that cost  
**[0:37:41-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:41):**  of like some companies are doing in the carbon side, like easy measurement tools, not that  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:45):**  deep, but still really innovating on that side.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:48):**  Or you would just say like, actually this is in the grand scheme of things of a landscape  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:51):**  approach of a corporate, this would be, I wouldn't say a rounding error, but it's  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:55):**  not so difficult to get it into a project like that because it's compared to extension  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:37:59):**  agents, changing management, different machinery, this is relatively small.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:03):**  I think it probably is a relatively small cost, but there is still a mindset shift that's  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:10):**  needed.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:11):**  These big corporates are not prioritising resources for measurement, I don't think.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:19):**  They don't have the budgets to do this sort of work.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:24):**  I mean, I think there's a huge, there's an obvious business case for it and they're  
**[0:38:28-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:28):**  doing all this work on carbon.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:30):**  A lot of the work they're doing on carbon has benefits for biodiversity as well.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:35):**  So for marginal additional investment, they could capture that information and really  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:40):**  shore up their sustainability claims.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:43):**  Because if you're doing a soil sample for carbon, I mean the step to sending it also  
**[0:38:48-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:48):**  to you is relatively small.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:50):**  I mean, of course you have to pay for the analytics, but somebody already did a soil  
**[0:38:54-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:54):**  sample.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:55):**  Yeah, it's maybe not quite that straightforward, but if you've got somebody in the field  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:38:59):**  taking samples, then absolutely they could be taking samples for biodiversity at the  
**[0:39:03-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:03):**  same time.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:05):**  But traditionally, I mean, we have this challenge that nature has historically been undervalued  
**[0:39:11-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:11):**  by our economic systems.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:13):**  I mean, we are in this situation.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:15):**  That's an understatement.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:16):**  Yeah, undervalued is an understatement.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:17):**  It must have been at zero or negative as a cost.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:20):**  Not valued, yeah.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:21):**  I mean, we're in the situation we're in because big corporates, farmers, I mean,  
**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:26):**  we get these ecosystem services for free.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:30):**  And so it does require a change of thinking to suddenly be like, well, there is value  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:36):**  in collecting information about biodiversity.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:40):**  There is value that I'm willing to pay for.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:41):**  I mean, I still have a lot of conversations with these multi-billion pound companies where  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:49):**  they're expecting biodiversity data to be served up to them for free, to be provided  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:54):**  by conservation NGOs.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:39:57):**  A lot of them are still not quite at the place where they're willing to invest in that  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:01):**  data collection.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:02):**  In that, as a crucial, just as they're investing in other accounting parts of their, or other  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:08):**  systems within their accounting just to have a good understanding of what's happening  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:12):**  in factories, what's happening in their supply chain, sensors here and there to understand  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:17):**  if things got frozen or not.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:18):**  I mean, that's all sort of, we take that for granted.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:20):**  That's part of the cost of running your operation, but of course, being able to understand  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:25):**  what's happening in the landscapes you're supplying from is just as much part of that  
**[0:40:30-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:30):**  as keeping an eye on where your containers are around the world.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:33):**  And if the temperature went up too much during the trip or not, and if you should be worried  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:36):**  about what's coming out when you open it in whatever harbour you open your container.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:40):**  Yeah, no, that's a very good point, actually.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:44):**  And so this brings up a question I always like to ask at the end as well, but would  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:47):**  that be something like if you had a magic wand and the magic power to change one thing  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:51):**  overnight, would it be something on that side or something completely different?  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:40:55):**  Like you can mention anything from global consciousness, I usually say better taste  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:41:00):**  or having a carbon price, like taking away all subsidies.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:41:04):**  We've had a lot of different answers to this question.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:41:05):**  It doesn't have to be on corporate biodiversity awareness, but what would you do if you had  
**[0:41:10-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:41:10):**  a magic wand?  
**[0:41:11-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:41:11):**  That's the most difficult question, I think.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:41:14):**  I mean, fundamentally, I think if we want to reverse the situation we are in, and that  
**[0:41:20-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:41:20):**  is the dual crisis of both nature and climate, we need a way to value and embed biodiversity,  
**[0:41:32-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:41:32):**  ecosystems better into our business practices.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:41:40):**  And I don't think businesses will achieve it alone.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:41:43):**  I think we need much better regulation.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:41:44):**  But yeah, if I could wave a magic wand, for sure.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:41:49):**  Would we have a price on biodiversity?  
**[0:41:51-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:41:51):**  I think is not perhaps quite the place I would take it to, but there needs to be incentives  
**[0:41:57-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:41:57):**  and disincentives for how we operate and use our natural capital.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:06):**  And what if you would be on the other side of the table, not on the corporate side, but  
**[0:42:09-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:09):**  let's say on the investor side?  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:11):**  There are a lot of people, even people are setting up quite significant funds saying  
**[0:42:15-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:15):**  we're going to invest in biodiversity, we're going to put money to work, etc.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:19):**  Two part question.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:20):**  First part of the question, what would you tell them?  
**[0:42:22-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:22):**  You probably meet them sometimes at conferences, virtually and offline.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:27):**  What would you say to the finance people that are starting to enter the space and say from  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:31):**  London City, from Zurich, from wherever, we want to invest in biodiversity.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:35):**  What would you tell them without starting to laugh in some cases, obviously, because  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:38):**  it sounds a bit naive sometimes, but how would you approach and say, okay, go and look a  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:43):**  bit deeper there or this is our interesting areas to go deeper into, obviously without  
**[0:42:47-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:47):**  getting investment advice?  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:48):**  I think they need to do their due diligence.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:52):**  They need to build good partnerships.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:42:56):**  You sort of see this narrative of suddenly nature exists and has value because finance  
**[0:43:01-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:01):**  has realised, decided.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:05):**  And there are fantastic people that have been working on this challenge for a long time  
**[0:43:10-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:10):**  and they have a lot of knowledge.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:13):**  So I would say, yeah, build good partnerships with those conservation organisations.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:20):**  Be humble.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:21):**  Yeah, be humble and bring in expertise.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:25):**  You are not going to become an expert on biodiversity and nature because you've listened to a few  
**[0:43:32-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:32):**  podcasts or read a few articles.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:36):**  I think I would really like to see some people embedding people with backgrounds and expertise  
**[0:43:41-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:41):**  in the space when they're building these new portfolios.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:48):**  Get the experts on board as well.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:50):**  I think it's the same.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:51):**  We see a lot of decks on carbon companies and are focusing on solar carbon, etc.  
**[0:43:56-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:56):**  And I always click very quickly to the team page.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:43:59):**  First of all, see the diversity, which is often shockingly low, but also where's the  
**[0:44:03-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:03):**  farmer?  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:04):**  Like where is the person that actually is dependent on a farm for his or her livelihood  
**[0:44:09-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:09):**  and decided that this is an interesting endeavour to spend some of his or her time on, which  
**[0:44:13-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:13):**  is usually running very, very low.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:15):**  And most of these, shockingly, don't have any connection to any farmer.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:19):**  And the first question I always ask, when is the last time you were on a piece of land?  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:23):**  And it's scary to get the answers to that and how much money gets raised and burned.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:29):**  And I think Robin O'Brien of Replant Capital mentioned in an interview a long time ago,  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:33):**  he sees this Silicon Valley ones raising crazy amounts of money and then not going anywhere  
**[0:44:39-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:39):**  because they don't have any product market fit because they didn't really go to the  
**[0:44:42-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:42):**  market and they didn't really spend the humble time on farms.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:45):**  And I'm imagining it's the same in biodiversity.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:48):**  There's a lot to learn on the field and in the field and in the water streams and with  
**[0:44:52-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:52):**  the people that have spent a lot of time there.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:54):**  So it's absolutely crucial.  
**[0:44:56-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:56):**  So what would you do if you would be in charge of a large investment fund?  
**[0:44:59-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:44:59):**  Like tomorrow morning you wake up and have a billion dollars or even 10 billion.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:04):**  The billions keep growing these days with inflation, so we might have to put an extra  
**[0:45:08-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:08):**  zero.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:09):**  But let's say a lot of money or billion pounds to invest and put to work could be very long-term  
**[0:45:12-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:12):**  investments but definitely investments.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:14):**  I'm not looking to you an exact pound amount, but what would you prioritise?  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:18):**  What would be the main themes or parts or technology or is it investing in?  
**[0:45:24-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:24):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:45:25-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:25):**  So I think like you've just mentioned the connection to the farmer is key.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:31):**  So investing in farmers, I think particularly smallholders who are going to need the most  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:38):**  support in making any big transition.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:41):**  I'm much less interested in big agri-business.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:44):**  I think if they have the will to change, I'm sure they can make the changes, but there  
**[0:45:49-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:49):**  are a lot of people that are fundamental to our agricultural systems, food systems that  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:56):**  will need a lot more support.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:45:57):**  And I think if you can empower them with the right tools and training, then we could make  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:46:03):**  quite a big difference.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:46:08):**  And I guess a frustration I have is that we see so much of this money, it's run by people  
**[0:46:19-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:46:19):**  behind desks in Europe, poor America or wherever it is.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:46:24):**  How can we find a much better way of deploying that money with local communities?  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:46:32):**  We see some amazing things that can happen with microfinance, for example.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:46:38):**  This project I talked about in Sierra Leone, there was a cocoa agroforestry project around  
**[0:46:46-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:46:46):**  this national park.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:46:49):**  But there were these fundamental challenges about, they were suffering from things like  
**[0:46:55-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:46:55):**  crop raiding from animals that were coming from the national park.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:46:59):**  So how do you put in place the economic financial mechanisms to ensure that they can value the  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:47:07):**  biodiversity in the national park while also supporting their livelihoods?  
**[0:47:12-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:47:12):**  You get these really cool solutions like these little micro insurance systems where you give  
**[0:47:18-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:47:18):**  them some seed funding and then they're off and running and they have that safety net  
**[0:47:22-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:47:22):**  in case something happens one year.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:47:28):**  Working with the farmers, particularly with smallholders, particularly empowering people  
**[0:47:33-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:47:33):**  who are actually producing the commodities to empower them to make changes.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:47:43):**  And I guess the other thing that I would be on the lookout for would be investing in innovation.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:47:48):**  And when you say innovation, better air sucking machines?  
**[0:47:52-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:47:52):**  No.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:47:53):**  So innovation, you get excited about or you wish we had already and not still being developed.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:47:59):**  So I mean, my background, of course, is much more about monitoring and evaluation, which  
**[0:48:05-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:48:05):**  I guess is the less exciting side of a sustainable transition.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:48:11):**  If I knew more about innovation that was going to help drive the sustainable practices, great,  
**[0:48:15-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:48:15):**  I would invest in that.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:48:17):**  But I am really excited about the innovation that we see in better ways to understand our  
**[0:48:23-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:48:23):**  agricultural systems.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:48:25):**  So whether that's eDNA or some exciting, you know, there's this really cool startup that's  
**[0:48:31-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:48:31):**  using acoustic monitoring to look at pollinator populations, for example.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:48:36):**  Tell me more about that because it sounds like we want to interview them.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:48:38):**  Yeah, no, I think like the tools, the enabling tools, I think the shovels and it's like to  
**[0:48:43-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:48:43):**  how to build this industry is fundamental.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:48:47):**  Yeah, I mean, I think we have overlooked the value that good monitoring can provide.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:48:55):**  It can inform more effective decisions.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:48:58):**  It can inform more effective resource use.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:49:01):**  It can inform more effective investment decisions.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:49:05):**  And we're just like we're on the edge of such an exciting space of the deployment of technology  
**[0:49:14-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:49:14):**  to answer some of these monitoring challenges.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:49:17):**  I mean, I think like a really good example has been how deforestation gets monitored  
**[0:49:24-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:49:24):**  and now in international supply chains.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:49:27):**  We have a global map that gets updated, you know, pretty much every day showing exactly  
**[0:49:34-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:49:34):**  where deforestation is happening in the world.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:49:38):**  Something like that for biodiversity would be amazing.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:49:41):**  So if you had that for biodiversity or a global map for soil health that you could track the  
**[0:49:47-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:49:47):**  changes on an annual or a monthly basis, depending on climate and other things.  
**[0:49:56-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:49:56):**  How cool would that be if you could see soil health or biodiversity from space?  
**[0:50:02-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:02):**  Yeah, we just recorded, just a few weeks ago, recorded an interview actually with Isha and  
**[0:50:07-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:07):**  Tom on OpenGeo map, OpenGeo Hub, sorry.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:10):**  And one of the articles they wrote is everybody has the right to know what's happening on  
**[0:50:13-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:13):**  our home planet or on our planet.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:15):**  And we were just thinking like, how do we get access to the satellite data?  
**[0:50:19-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:19):**  How do we translate it into something useful for the land steward, the farm manager, whoever,  
**[0:50:24-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:24):**  like exactly the conversation we have here.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:26):**  So I will link that one below as well, because I think we are on the crips of starting to  
**[0:50:30-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:30):**  actually know and see what is happening on our home planet.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:34):**  And then hopefully we take action.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:36):**  But first is knowing it is no longer good enough to say, okay, I didn't know that tree  
**[0:50:40-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:40):**  was being felled, or I didn't know that legal road was being built, or I didn't know that  
**[0:50:45-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:45):**  that field was being sprayed, even though we're paying the farmer, or even though the  
**[0:50:49-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:49):**  company taking the grain had an agreement that it should be organic or should be beyond  
**[0:50:53-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:53):**  organic etc, etc.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:54):**  Like that kind of level of transparency, we need it because we're on a full planet and  
**[0:50:59-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:50:59):**  we're having to manage these resources fundamentally different.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:03):**  So yeah, there's this fundamental way you can use this information to encourage compliance.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:10):**  But I think there's also, you can flip it, right, in terms of knowledge is power.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:14):**  And we can also use that to do things better in future, like testing interventions.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:20):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:22):**  We can see the effect of things if we have a good map of biodiversity on even on a landscape  
**[0:51:27-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:27):**  level.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:28):**  Okay, we start switching certain fertiliser inputs, especially with these high prices.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:35):**  But in general, we start switching to certain bio fertilisers, we start integrating trees  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:38):**  into ecosystems, what does it do to the overall ecosystem of biodiversity is something we  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:43):**  I don't think I've ever really monitored, at least not at scale.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:48):**  And then of course, looking at the climate and all of that, like, how does it influence  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:51):**  that full, the full ecosystem and the full landscape is extremely exciting.  
**[0:51:56-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:56):**  Super.  
**[0:51:57-0:51:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:57):**  Now, I want to thank you so much.  
**[0:51:58-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:58):**  I want to be conscious of your time as well.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:51:59):**  And thank you so much.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:52:00):**  There's so much more to ask, but we'll have you back and unpack more, especially as you're  
**[0:52:04-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:52:04):**  getting more and more into the ag space, let's say, and the exciting ways of using eDNA into  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:52:10):**  changing management practices and changing large scale or changing the practices at a  
**[0:52:15-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:52:15):**  large scale or at a lot of hectares or acres or whatever we're managing, because that's  
**[0:52:19-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:52:19):**  the impact we need.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:52:20):**  So thank you so much for your time today.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:52:22):**  Yeah, my pleasure.

**[0:53:36-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:53:36):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:53:40-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:53:40):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:53:44):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:53:46-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:53:46):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:53:50-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:53:50):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:53:55-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:53:55):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:54:00):**  What have we seen in this space over the last years?

**[0:54:20-0:54:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:54:20):**  You the soil builders and investors in this space.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:54:23):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,

**[0:54:37-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:54:37):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:54:41-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:54:41):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  
**[0:54:46-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:54:46):**  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,

**[0:54:54-0:54:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:54:54):**  No.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:54:55):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:54:57):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:01):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:55:05-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:05):**  different means.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:06):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:55:12-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:12):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:14):**  Thank you.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:15):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:55:16-0:55:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:16):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:23):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:25):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:55:30-0:55:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:30):**  is so risky.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:31):**  How to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest  
**[0:55:36-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:36):**  in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if  
**[0:55:40-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:40):**  you're a soil builder.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:42):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:55:46-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:46):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:50):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:55:55-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:55):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:55:56-0:55:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:56):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:55:58-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:55:58):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:56:01):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:56:04):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:56:06-0:56:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:56:06):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:56:11):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on  
**[0:56:15-0:56:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cath-tayleur#t=0:56:15):**  the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

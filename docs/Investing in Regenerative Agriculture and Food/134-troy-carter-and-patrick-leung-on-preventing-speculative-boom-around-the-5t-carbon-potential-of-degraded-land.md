**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:00:14):**  If landowners and stewards could visualize what regeneration would look like on their  land, what options they have in their context plus the financial and environmental and social  benefits it would yield, would that kickstart the landscape regeneration movement?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:00:26):**  Is visualization the potential of landscape scale regeneration the missing puzzle piece?  And what about the enormous carbon arbitrage opportunities which exist or will exist between  very degraded land and their prices compared to carbon income or the potential carbon income  
**[0:00:42-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:00:42):**  of regeneration?  How do we make sure that we don't get an enormous speculative boom which leaves the current  stewards of the land worse off?  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:00:52):**  Temporary climate change, bringing back rivers, preventing floods and obviously lots and lots  of nutrient dense food.  The promises of REGEN-AG often sound straight out of a science fiction book.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:01:03):**  And for these promises to be met we need to significantly scale regeneration to a landscape  scale within this decade.  Welcome to a new series where we look into the technologies needed to bring regeneration  
**[0:01:15-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:01:15):**  to a landscape scale.  In this series we'll look at already existing technologies, digital tech, ag tech, new financing  mechanisms etc. that can scale fast enough during the next 10 years.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:01:26):**  Technologies which put significantly more money into the pockets of farmers, landowners  and land stewards who are regenerating their and our soils so they can go faster.  And we'll ask the question what is missing?  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:01:38):**  What needs to be urgently developed over the next years?  We're very happy with the support for this series by the Grantham Environmental Trust  which supports strategic communications and collaboration in solving the world's most  
**[0:01:49-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:01:49):**  pressing environmental problems.  You can find out more at granthamfoundation.org  In March last year we launched our membership community.

**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:02:19):**  Thank you.  Welcome to another episode today with Earthshot Labs working on measuring global ecosystems  to support incentivizing land regeneration for climate change mitigation, thriving human  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:02:30):**  civilization and to preserve nature for its own sake.  Welcome Troy and Patrick.  Thanks so much for having us.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:02:36):**  Thank you.  Great to be here.  And as always to start with a personal question.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:02:40):**  How did both of you, let's start with Troy, end up in soil or on soil and working on regeneration  also be on soil.  Let's start with Troy.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:02:49):**  Yeah.  So this is Troy.  I don't think I'm particularly unique in this time because let's face it, the climate  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:02:58):**  crisis and ecological collapse is the largest theme of this decade.  Ask any 14 year old some of the things that they care about and climate change might be  pretty high on the list.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:03:11):**  So you know, my background, the previous company that started as Rhizome were pioneering large  scale reforestation and bamboo engineered lumber in the Philippines.  And through the process of operating that company, we really identified some very broken  
**[0:03:27-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:03:27):**  aspects of carbon markets and other ways in which we try to incentivize landowners to  do the right thing on land.  And Earthshot was born out of a mission to do ecological restoration at a planetary scale.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:03:46):**  And so Patrick and I came together to identify high leverage points to use technology to  help that happen.  And what about you, Patrick?  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:03:54):**  Well, I came into this realm of ecological restoration a lot later than Troy.  So I have a long background in technology, both at Google as well as within the environment  of an investment fund, figuring out ways to use data science and machine learning to make  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:04:09):**  better investments.  And then when Troy and I met, it was a really interesting synergy between our experiences  on his side for regenerative agriculture and bamboo based lumber, and then on my side with  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:04:19):**  data science applied in large scale investing and technology environments.  And I just realized that I had all these skills and valuable experiences and connections.  And I felt a real strong calling to actually apply them in service of the planet and in  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:04:34):**  service of restoring nature.  So I think that that really came out in the last couple of years as being something that  was something I wanted to dedicate my life to.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:04:43):**  And then you mentioned, Troy, you were going through an exercise of figuring out what are  the biggest nodes in the system where leverage can be applied, what is missing there?  What did that process look like?  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:04:55):**  And how did you get to where you're now, which we'll of course talk about, but I'm always  interested in that prioritization phase and figuring out, okay, what do you choose to  focus your time and energy on?  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:05:06):**  Which is a huge question I get from a lot of people, okay, I would like to work in regeneration  and work in region A, but where should I focus if I'm not a farmer?  Yeah.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:05:17):**  So I would say Earthshot was born out of Patrick and I's, like our conversations, we just had  every day or every week for the last year and a half.  And the problem space was really clear.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:05:32):**  We want to address the climate crisis with holistic nature based solutions, because nature  needs to be restored for its own sake, as well as has holistic benefits and is the foundation  of true wealth for all humans.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:05:50):**  So we want to encourage nature.  So how do we do that?  We identified a few key steps in that process that we were uniquely positioned to address.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:06:03):**  The first step was measurement.  Basically, if you can measure it, then we can incentivize for action or behavior or  policy.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:06:12):**  So the first step we came up with was let's create an accurate model of the relevant global  ecosystems, including forests, soil, water, and now we're working on biodiversity or will  be soon.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:06:25):**  So to start, we started a Slack community and invited about 50 of our friends to spend  a month together and was like, okay, hey, let's see if we can give it a go at creating  and using existing academic literature and satellite imagery and machine learning to  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:06:43):**  see what we can do in a month.  And after about a month, we hit the cutting edge of science quite quickly and said, okay,  we've got something here.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:06:52):**  Let's keep going.  And there was that model that you mentioned to identify ecosystems or what was that cutting  edge that you felt, okay, now we're getting to something juicy.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:07:01):**  So that was basically looking at the existing academic literature in above ground biomass  forecasting in statistical modeling of soil carbon and of water restoration interventions.  And in each of these categories, we realized that either the academics had great models  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:07:22):**  that were never actually applied in any product or that the academic models actually didn't  bring into account satellite imagery from the last years or modern machine learning  methods to actually extrapolate that satellite imagery in a useful way across the entire  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:07:41):**  globe.  So we essentially took existing academic literature and extended it using additional data sources  and additional methods.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:07:50):**  And that was in a month.  And then what made you I mean, that that's I would say it's a nice side project or it's  nice.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:08:00):**  Okay, these are the limits or this is the potential.  But then you didn't stop there and you started pushing.  Yeah, I think the vision caught us.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:08:08):**  And what the vision was, was second step of the problem, which we're calling land OS.  And it's how to give every landowner on Earth, every policymaker, every investor, the ability  to visualize tangibly what will happen to their land if they do regenerative interventions,  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:08:31):**  and then viewing individual actions, and the possibilities that unfold when they're applied  across an entire landscape or continent level.  We basically got caught by the vision where this is one of the biggest ideas on Earth  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:08:46):**  right now, where land use is a major contributor to climate change, but it can also be the  biggest solution, at least two thirds of climate solutions will be driven by regenerative land  use and nature based solutions.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:09:01):**  And so the possibility of a grand unified ecosystem model is now actually realistic.  And another thing is the level of cultural will that we saw among volunteer open source  contributors to the data aspect of this project.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:09:20):**  You know, now we have about a thousand members in the community.  And this has grown so fast, and in a way that we have been blessed by the most brilliant  world class people we've ever met, that are heart centered, that have a deep care for  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:09:39):**  the planet, have a deep care for ecosystems, have a deep care for people in developing  countries of holistic view of what this crisis actually is.  And we've been so impressed by people volunteering their time, and creating a sort of organizational  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:09:58):**  culture that we've never seen before.  So it's been hugely validating and exciting.  And Patrick, can you walk us through how land OS would work?  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:10:08):**  As I'm a landowner, and I think it's one of the issues and we can discuss more about how  that is actually neglected at the moment, like to be able to visualize and to see the  potential of an ecosystem, a piece of land or a large piece of land, small piece of land,  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:10:23):**  what is actually possible, as we're so used to the current state and the current state  of going slowly down or fast in some cases?  Like how would that would it be me wearing VR glasses?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:10:33):**  Would it be me looking at a computer screen?  What would I actually see and feel and touch and smell when I see the potential, obviously  choosing different things and different levels and different, what would it be like?  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:10:44):**  Sure.  I think the first step is definitely outreach.  Like the idea would be that we would sort of already analyze the landowner or the farmers  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:10:51):**  land and give them some kind of form of outreach where we'd say, Hey, we think that we could  add this much value to your land, grab them, have them click through to our tool.  And there they can see basically here is the kind of current status of where things are.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:11:05):**  And here are what, as far as your lands current sort of economic potential, as far as its  current use and essentially give them like kind of a detailed view that our models currently  say as far as groundwater, as far as current soil organic carbon, as far as above ground  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:11:21):**  biomass and carbon estimations.  And just for my information, this is possible now around the globe for any piece of land  or is it limited to where you have certain data sources?  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:11:32):**  Yeah.  So we have some models that are already global in scope and we have other models that are  more localized because of the limitations of ground data.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:11:39):**  And we're looking to really overcome those limitations, but it seems like every month  there's some new data set that arrives that gives us a different piece of the puzzle.  Like we just recently made contact with a group called Open Geo Hub based in Europe.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:11:51):**  And they have the most amazing soil data set that they spend a lot of time preparing and  aligning amongst a bunch of different sort of source data sets.  And so we thought we'd have to do that ourselves, but because both groups are open source, all  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:12:03):**  of the research we're doing and that they're doing is open source, we can just share data  and they've saved us many, many months of effort to put that data set together.  And where does it touch on the agriculture piece?  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:12:14):**  Like do you already have models on the silver pasture side?  Like this is a cattle rancher that in your example, maybe doesn't want to stop completely  with cattle ranching.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:12:23):**  Maybe once actually switched to regenerative practices, does that get complicated very  fast?  Like how are you going to plant the trees compared to certain grass types, et cetera,  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:12:32):**  or how does that, how does it look like in your vision?  Yeah, definitely.  It's our intention to be able to provide different regenerative agricultural scenarios to be  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:12:41):**  played out in the simulator.  Agriculture is a lot more complex because it does involve, you know, kind of harvesting  multiple crops and figuring out the interplay between those crops.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:12:50):**  We do, we are partnering with several groups that are really versant in regenerative agriculture,  including climate farmers in Europe and including Regen Network over here in the US.  I would say that's likely to be a later, like a subsequent kind of version of Lando West.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:13:06):**  Like we'll start off with some of the kind of relatively more simple interventions like  straight up reforestation and various forms of water restoration.  And then we'll move on to the more complex cases like regenerative agriculture once we  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:13:17):**  have more on the ground experience and once we have a platform that really, that really  works for those initial use cases.  And so what is the potential?  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:13:24):**  I think it's a very interesting in this time, we're recording this in the summer of 2021,  where it seems half the world is on fire and the other half is flooding away.  Plus, I don't know how many fires in the US plus many others that I'm probably not aware  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:13:38):**  of because the news seems to be too full.  Do you see that providing that visual, what could be, is that the key?  Was that, or is that a missing link compared to all the other things you could be doing  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:13:50):**  with this data as well to provide it to policymakers, et cetera?  Do you see that landowners don't see the potential yet and thus nothing is happening?  Or why did you focus so much or are you focusing so much on that visualizing and seeing the  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:14:04):**  vision of a piece of land?  Yeah, maybe I can chime in on that.  The first thing is I don't, it's not just the visualization, it's all of it, right?  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:14:14):**  It's the financial case.  It's the level of perceived and actual risk.  It's the emotional connection to a truly restored piece of land.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:14:23):**  It's seeing the value.  So let's talk about a couple of specific use cases.  For example, Southern Portugal is a seasonally arid environment.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:14:33):**  There's plenty of rain in the winter and it's a very hot, dry summer.  And it looks like a desert.  And the reason it looks like a desert is because the water cycle is broken.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:14:43):**  And to restore the water cycle, building small earthen dams, swales, and tiny stream check  dams would slow down the water cycle, provide enough water throughout the summer to do revegetation  in a way that would restore that to being a completely forested environment.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:15:04):**  That would change the economics of forestry.  That would change the economics of agriculture of Portugal.  And it would dramatically change like this total, like what the ecosystem actually looks  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:15:16):**  like, what we actually perceive is a desert actually isn't a desert or doesn't have to  be a desert.  Think of another use case in Australia.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:15:26):**  You know, cattle stocking rates have been going down and down and down.  And now most of Australia is considered like a completely barren desert with some massive,  massive flash floods that have wiped away a lot of topsoil.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:15:40):**  That doesn't have to be the case.  And so now this land, which is considered somewhere like $50 or $100 an acre, something  like ridiculously low valued in terms of agricultural productivity, actually has a much higher value  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:15:55):**  if the water cycles slowed down with revegetation and reforestation, where the carbon sequestration  value is actually much, much higher than the current agricultural value of the land.  Based on techniques that have never been applied at a landscape level algorithmically.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:16:15):**  Another case study, one of my friends Rajendra Singh, he's a very brilliant man called the  Water Gandhi in India, restored seven rivers in Rajasthan by assembling 100,000 people  and building these small earthen interventions and shallow injection wells, you know, really  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:16:34):**  using shovels and people power.  And that restored the livelihoods and economic vitality of a region for tens of millions  of people based on the restoration of water cycles.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:16:46):**  So we know it's possible.  We can imagine that these techniques can be applied at landscape level all across the  world.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:16:55):**  But we need to show a compelling simulation to policymakers.  For example, California.  How do we solve the California water crisis?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:17:03):**  We need to provide a compelling simulation to landowners and policymakers so that they  can actually go make the decisions and understand what the effects will be two and 10 and 30  years down the road.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:17:15):**  Because that's what you feel that's missing.  Like we like the swales and key line design and many other practice have been around for  a long time, in many cases for centuries.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:17:25):**  We've all seen it at permaculture courses, we've seen it applied at farms with amazing  results.  And I think many of us have also imagined what would happen if we apply this to a watershed.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:17:36):**  The issue is or what you're describing is we never were able, we're only able to imagine  it but not to actually simulate it and to say, okay, what would happen on a watershed  level if we apply swales at the right place at the right time?  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:17:47):**  And what happens 10 years down the line or 15 or 20, etc, etc.  That's the missing, making the imagination tangible seems to be the missing link is what  you're saying.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:17:57):**  Yeah, part of it and part of it is also the fact that many, many companies and efforts  in this space, including private governments, NGOs, institutions, carbon is a big focus  right now.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:18:10):**  And for good reason because it's interesting because you're talking about carbon and then  you switch to water, right?  Yeah.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:18:16):**  So talk about that.  So it's all one problem.  And we can't be too reductionistic in making it a problem about there being too much carbon  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:18:25):**  dioxide in the atmosphere.  That is a proximate immediate issue that we need to address.  And so we can build large machines, we can do all these innovative pathways to take that  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:18:37):**  carbon dioxide and put it into other forms.  But even if we had a magic wand and we're able to do that right now, we would still  be left with a crisis of thousands of species going extinct of unprecedented disruptions  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:18:53):**  in small water cycles and in very large water cycles in these mass scale weather patterns.  And so this is not just a problem with CO2, it's a problem of ecosystems losing balance.  And so the fundamental places where we need to understand ecosystems are in water cycles,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:19:13):**  are in soil and are in forests and also in biodiversity, which for us is sort of an indicator  of just general health of the ecosystem.  And so we don't know of any other initiative that is taking as comprehensive of an approach  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:19:31):**  and then actually applying solutions.  So yes, carbon is something that we can measure and get paid for so that there's a direct  incentive to the landowner to do an intervention.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:19:42):**  That's really important.  But just as important is that we actually solve the real crisis, which is imbalanced  ecosystems.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:19:50):**  So in the process of having a landowner get paid for carbon, we also want to start introducing  metrics around water, around biodiversity and around soil health that support long term  wealth for the landowner, support regenerative livelihoods so that agricultural production  
**[0:20:09-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:20:09):**  or agroforestry or forestry can continue in a way that provides multi-generational incomes.  And then it's also other issues, right?  This is about indigenous land agency and climate justice and inclusivity of how an ownership  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:20:26):**  and ownership is you can talk about landowners.  Who owns land?  What is your I would say, what's your feeling about that?  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:20:34):**  Like, yeah, some people say land ownership is the biggest underlying reason we are private  land ownership are in many of these different masses.  What is your feeling there?  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:20:45):**  Yeah, as you're working with many of them?  I mean, this is a really deep theme, because people who live on land and have lived on  that piece of land for many generations tend to really love it.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:20:58):**  They feel connected, they have cultural history stories, direct intimate connection with that  place.  So people who have that sort of connection, don't just go around chopping down the forest.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:21:10):**  That's not actually why forests get chopped down.  They get chopped down because of economic stresses that are placed upon those people  with that connection, because of food security, because of a change in legal land ownership  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:21:26):**  that disenfranchises the people that are actually there.  So there are many, many issues.  And I don't have a one line solution to the problem of the complexity of land ownership  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:21:41):**  and remote land ownership and land ownership by very large institutions or governments  that don't have the best interests of a particular place or people in their incentive structure.  But what we can do is say, we have a strong intention and belief that designing proper  
**[0:22:02-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:22:02):**  incentive structures can actually reward land stewardship in a beautiful way.  And that will require a thousand tiny product decisions over the course of the coming decades  that we can't plan on, that we can't codify right now.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:22:20):**  All we can do is build the advisory network, build the feedback systems with local people  so that our product can actually take them into account constantly versus essentially  a colonial mine site where we think that land OS will provide these people the answer.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:22:40):**  What we are doing is providing a feedback loop where we can take local knowledge and  support the elements of the value chain that need to scale.  For example, carbon credit markets.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:22:53):**  It's really hard to get on a carbon credit market right now for someone who doesn't have  much internet access or doesn't have $500,000 to pay professional consultants or doesn't  have the technological knowledge.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:23:06):**  So we need to solve the parts of the chain that are ours to solve and then provide inputs  from indigenous and local wisdom of people who've been doing it in that area for centuries  or millennia.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:23:19):**  Yeah, I think I could just add to that a little bit and just say, I think one of the underlying  basic problems we have is that our economy doesn't really value the things that should  be valued, including biodiversity, including the groundwater, including soil itself and  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:23:35):**  its quality.  These are all things that we derive massive economic benefit from and whose lack results  in catastrophe.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:23:43):**  And with the exception of carbon, which is something that we're emitting more into the  atmosphere that pushes things off out of balance, we started to recognize that removing carbon  from the current state of the atmosphere is a good thing and of value, of economic value.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:24:00):**  But there's a whole host of other things that we're starting to see progress on and we're  looking to push on this as well.  Like if you look at, for instance, Regen Network's Carbon Plus initiative, where they're looking  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:24:09):**  to kind of start to recognize the value of the co-benefits of biodiversity and soil health  and water and so on.  So this is a necessary shift where we really do recognize, yes, these are things that are  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:24:21):**  worth preserving.  These are things that are worth restoring.  And to your question about the land ownership, there's different views on this, but I think  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:24:28):**  that the fact that people who sort of quote, own land, feel that they can do whatever they  want with that land, that's essentially led to a lot of problems as well.  So I think that valuing things that are clearly of immense value to humanity, but are currently  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:24:42):**  not recognized and treating the land with respect, connecting with it in a way that's  more like the way that indigenous peoples connect with their land, with the land that  they have stewardship over and their ancestral areas, we go a long way towards preventing  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:24:56):**  the kind of mess that we're in today.  So let's talk about the carbon arbitrage, which you called in your last newsletter,  doesn't showing the potential of these places and these degraded land where many won't see  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:25:08):**  any potential because it just seems like a desert, like people, but actually it doesn't  have to be, could also trigger an enormous gold rush to buying up these places as soon  as possible for the lowest price possible.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:25:18):**  And then doing some of the work maybe, or just hoping for somebody else to show up and  buy it from slightly more like it.  It could also lead to speculation, which maybe isn't a bad thing if we want to fix a lot  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:25:30):**  of these things, but somehow always feels like a bad thing.  What is the, because as more people wake up to the potential of regenerative practices  at a landscape scale, why we're running the series, and there will be much more interest  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:25:44):**  from a lot of people looking for maybe some quick money, which I don't think there's in  Regen, I can general, but looking for some ways to get in on it without doing all the  hard work.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:25:54):**  So I'll let you in on a secret.  The reason we're doing Earthshot is not to solve climate change.  The fundamental reason why we're doing it is because we love nature and we love nature  
**[0:26:07-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:26:07):**  for its own sake and believe that beautiful ancient biodiverse landscapes should exist.  And so in a way we're using the opportunity of crisis to address an issue that we believe  in anyway.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:26:25):**  And so let's take this in the process of transitioning land values from a degraded landscape to a  landscape with potential very high carbon sequestration value.  There will be a lot of unintended consequences, same as there will be a lot of unintended  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:26:42):**  consequences for the big machines sucking carbon.  Yeah.  Anything else we do.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:26:48):**  Anything else, including measurement.  What we measure will determine incentive structures and when we incentivize something, for example,  carbon sequestration, if we wanted to sequester all the carbon the fastest, we would probably  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:27:02):**  plant a lot of bamboo everywhere on Earth, billions and billions of acres and probably  end up with a monoculture.  And so on the surface, hey, that's a really good thing.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:27:12):**  Climate change solved.  And what we're left with might not be the ecosystem that sustains in every region.  Like the level of resilience and biodiversity could go down, even to the level of soil microorganisms,  
**[0:27:25-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:27:25):**  which we have a very shallow understanding of the trillions of different little microorganisms  that are just as complex as human life on Earth.  We don't know the effect of interventions like that.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:27:39):**  So unintended consequences around local people losing land agency from institutional buyers  or governments coming in and purchasing land is a real issue.  We don't know whether it's good or bad for large institutions to go purchase undervalued  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:27:57):**  land.  I think it will happen.  It's inevitable that it will happen when land prices change and people see what we think  
**[0:28:05-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:28:05):**  is probably a more than five trillion dollar carbon land arbitrage over the coming couple  decades.  And this is based on modeling.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:28:14):**  This is not just like you putting a number up.  Right.  This is based on land that is currently valued anywhere between fifty dollars and two thousand  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:28:24):**  dollars an acre.  Some of that land could go as high as five thousand dollars an acre in terms of carbon  sequestration value.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:28:31):**  And that's based on biomass growth rates in tropical areas.  That's based on different agroforestry products like bamboo that have very high carbon sequestration  rates and also fairly high agricultural returns from mixed cash crops like Brazil nuts and  
**[0:28:51-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:28:51):**  coffee and chocolate and also the reality of rising carbon prices.  Two years ago, carbon markets were in a very different place than they are now.  Now there is massive, massive demand, particularly for nature based carbon removals.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:29:08):**  And so the price of those is ten dollars now, maybe next year it'll be fifteen.  Maybe in the future years, you know, we're already seeing regulatory markets in Canada,  in Scandinavia and throughout the EU in particular pricing carbon as high as fifty dollars a  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:29:25):**  ton over the coming years.  So yeah, we had Jim Mann of the Future Forest Company on the setting on the voluntary markets,  but especially around there is a market of the edge stuff around biochar and enhance  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:29:38):**  weathering selling to Stripe for, I think around biochar was fifty dollars a ton and  sweatering two hundred.  So there is how big that market is, is a second.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:29:47):**  But there's definitely also on the voluntary side, a market that pays and pays really,  really well to a certain level and limit.  And for sure, they are all hoping, of course, the market comes down.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:29:56):**  That's why Stripe is doing that.  But until now, it seems like there's a lot more hunger out there and then there is actually  supply.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:30:02):**  Yeah, definitely.  I think you're making a good point, though.  Any system in which people get rewarded for doing certain things, human beings will try  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:30:09):**  to game it.  You know, like it's just that's kind of one of the facts of life.  And we've already seen that in carbon markets as well, with people trying to kind of shift  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:30:16):**  projects around and organize them in such a way that they are compliant with certain  methodologies, but there's actually not as much net gain across the whole of their portfolios  of forestry or of land use than they might seem.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:30:28):**  And so we're already seeing there are investors out there that are a little bit gun shy about  some of the projects that are out there and all of this kind of carbon sequestration is  going on because there are people already gaming the system.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:30:39):**  And so this is a moving frontier, right?  I mean, we are in the voluntary markets, especially it's undergoing a period of great change where  there's a lot of new technology coming in, a lot of new methodologies.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:30:48):**  And we want to lead by example.  You know, we want to jump in there and actually show people this is the way to do this.  This is the way to develop land in such a way that we can restore nature, we can generate  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:31:00):**  decent returns and create economic value while also doing things in a responsible way that  results in an ecosystem that's actually good for the planet and it's good for the people  that live on it.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:31:11):**  And I think that'll go a long way towards helping to set a bar there as far as here's  the way that this should be done in a holistic way that's good for everyone and good for  the animals and the beings on the land, as well as for us, the humans that essentially  
**[0:31:24-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:31:24):**  are the stewards of that land.  So what's next for land OS and you mentioned a number of case studies.  What is next for this project or for Earth life and Earth shot labs in general to make  
**[0:31:35-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:31:35):**  it more concrete to get swales in and to move water in a different way, et cetera?  Sure.  So I'll tell you where we are now.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:31:44):**  Right now we have five project teams, three research teams and two product teams.  So the research teams are the soil team, the forest team and the water team, and we'll  be expanding into biodiversity soon.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:31:57):**  And these teams are a consortium of international academics, different institutions, data scientists,  software engineers, pretty much all volunteers contributing to a coherent global way of  measuring ecosystems.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:32:13):**  For us, that's a very important step.  If we can agree as a globe on how to measure things in a peer reviewed rigorous process  where everyone can see the methods, that's a very, very powerful tool to unlock products.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:32:26):**  The land OS and biome teams are doing something pretty cool and we'll have a product release  in the coming months.  And land OS, the first iteration will be viewing ecosystem and regenerative interventions that  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:32:40):**  anyone on Earth can see what to do with their land to optimize for ecological regeneration  and profitability.  But we're also developing something called we're calling carbon as a service.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:32:51):**  So rather than going through a very complex process of onboarding carbon credits, our  system will have remote verification plus crowdsourced on the ground site observations  to generate a carbon credit on a blockchain based system.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:33:09):**  And the way we're doing carbon verification is a bit unique than what happens right now.  What happens right now is that a professional verifier comes through, spends a year on feasibility  studies and project documentation, charges a few hundred thousand dollars and sends an  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:33:24):**  auditor through to actually go collect biomass samples using a tape measure and then allometric  equations for the species on the ground.  A lot of those steps can be automated and a lot of them can actually be more accurate  
**[0:33:36-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:33:36):**  when taken through on the ground observations.  So we're developing an app called Biome and it's essentially a way to collect LIDAR from  modern iPhones as well as pictures of trees to identify more accurately site observation  
**[0:33:53-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:33:53):**  data and in a way that costs the landowner nothing.  So going from five hundred thousand dollars in two years to a very fast process that takes  a few hours and is free for the landowner to onboard carbon credits is a much more scalable  
**[0:34:09-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:34:09):**  proposition.  And so that's sort of the first stage is in the next six months releasing the land OS  plus biome system for onboarding carbon credits and providing landowner recommendations.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:34:23):**  Also within the next six months we'll be starting our first pilot project for doing actual on  the ground reforestation and land restoration operations.  And this is not something that you know we've gotten a lot of a lot of pushback on this  
**[0:34:37-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:34:37):**  as well.  This is not something a tech company is supposed to do.  You're not supposed to go actually like put trees in the ground.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:34:44):**  You know that's something that a non scalable operator should do.  And what we realized is that we need to learn a lot.  So we've partnered with people from the largest reforestation organizations in the world to  
**[0:34:59-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:34:59):**  lead our first pilot project and develop a reforestation methodology and playbook on  how to do reforestation and land restoration using best practices from decades of reforestation  operations as well as local site specific wisdom and automating the parts of the process  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:35:26):**  can be automated providing scale to parts of the process that need scale.  So for example nursery planting operations irrigation and then allowing for site specific  variations among tree species selection among pioneering or timing based on plantings.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:35:47):**  And do you have any idea where the pilot will happen because yes we do mean really like  which if you cannot name a site of is it which area of the world are we talking about.  So we're we're looking at sites right now in Panama and Mexico as places that we have  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:36:05):**  deeply trusted on the ground partners to work with and landowners that are very willing  and a lot of will from local government to actually make this happen.  So those will be our areas for initial pilots and then we essentially want to build a reforestation  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:36:22):**  playbook and are in the process of building one where we can catalyze a thousand different  project developers around the world to do reforestation at scale using land OS and biome  as monitoring verification technology and the other technological planning and processes  
**[0:36:42-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:36:42):**  that are needed for an operator to go do tens of thousands of hectares of reforestation  and have the economic incentive structures for maintaining it and paying for it and the  organizational capacity to actually go implement and have thousands or tens of thousands of  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:37:01):**  employees actually doing that.  And what is missing?  I like to ask this question of a magic wand like if you have a magic wand if you could  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:37:08):**  change one thing in the food and access but I want to just a bit for it here in terms  of tech as you are a tech company like what would you really wish that tomorrow morning  would exist in your playbook in your data set or anywhere else in terms of technology  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:37:22):**  what is missing currently to get to get regeneration to a landscape or an ecosystem or watershed  scale?  Patrick and I might have different answers so I'm curious what he says.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:37:31):**  For me measurement is still the fundamental problem right now.  So what I would wish for is a comprehensive understanding of small and large water cycles  on land so that we can provide specific algorithmic recommendations for every single swale, check  
**[0:37:53-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:37:53):**  dam, injection whale, beaver dam analog or actual beaver introduction and have a very  specific accurate way of conveying that information to landowners, policymakers and investors  so that they can see what would happen if we did water restoration.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:38:10):**  If you do this if you do that then this happens probably with this probability and that happens  after.  Right and having it have a time series understanding over the next 50 years here's what would happen  
**[0:38:22-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:38:22):**  on the water cycle.  Or here's what happens if you don't that's also interesting like what if you don't do  the intervention this is the downward facing slope of your landscape.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:38:31):**  And basically just how I understand climate modeling and even atmospheric land-based ocean-based  there's still pretty broad strokes right now of recommendations that we can do.  And so over the next six months to a year we will be getting much much more specific  
**[0:38:49-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:38:49):**  but it's something I want to happen right now.  Yeah because it's pretty and then we get to Patrick but it's pretty essential where you  put your swale, where you plant your tree, where and so Patrick what would you wish for  
**[0:38:58-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:38:58):**  if you had a magic wand?  Mine actually is pretty similar to Troy's in the sense that right now we're on a bit  of a quest to find things.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:39:06):**  So this is really why we decided to build Biome in the first place was that we looked  out there at the existing citizen science apps and we just realized that they didn't  have the capabilities we needed in order to gather the field data we need.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:39:17):**  So all manner of different tree information around species and diameter and height and  forest canopy density and all that kind of thing would be amazing for all the different  kind of biomes in the world.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:39:29):**  Definitely finding water features so the existing just to pick on dams because they're probably  amongst the easier ones to detect but the existing databases have 40,000, 60,000, maybe  100,000 dams worldwide.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:39:43):**  Apparently there are estimates out there that there are roughly 16 million, at least 16  million small dams in the world.  So there's a huge differential between the data sets that are out there.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:39:52):**  That's enormous.  And basically all the little dams that exist in the world.  So we don't know our water systems at all basically.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:39:59):**  Yeah so we want to go find them all so that we can have more accurate models that can  then tell you here's where you should actually build them.  And then take a lot of them away and how to build a dam and how high.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:40:10):**  Yeah so and the second thing I would say would be that grand unified ecological modeling  system.  So we've seen parts of such a system implemented in the past.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:40:18):**  For instance there's a paper I found a bunch of researchers in Iran analyzing the land  there because they have a kind of this water basin system is very arid and so they were  trying to figure out well where should we build dams in order to maximize the water  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:40:32):**  capture.  And that is a really complex problem.  You got to consider the precipitation patterns throughout the year.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:40:38):**  You've got to consider the runoff and the terrain of the land.  You got to consider the absorption rate of the soil and the composition of the soil.  And then you've got to consider factors like the cost and effectiveness of a dam in a  
**[0:40:51-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:40:51):**  given position on the water table.  So they had four or five different machine learning methods that they composed together.  And this was in a quite a limited area.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:40:59):**  And so our dream is to have a grand unified version of that where anywhere in the world  you can situate that we can tell you the optimal places to situate dams based on the effectiveness  in terms of water that's collected and in terms of cost of construction and all that.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:41:14):**  So we'll get there.  You know we have the necessary people on the team to get us there but it's going to take  time and like Troy says time is of the essence here.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:41:21):**  So if I could wave that magic wand I'd say give us the best possible data set for things  like water interventions across the planet and soil samples and all the stuff that we  hope to collect with the biome app.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:41:32):**  But just now a bit of help with the modeling you know in terms of all the machine learning  techniques necessary to kind of put that data to use in terms of predicting ecological systems  behavior.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:41:43):**  So what would you say?  It feels like we're very early and at the same time very much along compared to 10 years  ago or 50 years ago in this journey to the investors listening obviously without giving  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:41:55):**  investment advice but to the investors listening to do this recording somewhere this year next  year or whenever.  What would you tell them to focus on?  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:42:04):**  Is that water side of things is that don't get too excited about carbon but it's a very  useful tool or visit XYZ.  What would you advise investors to start looking into more?  
**[0:42:16-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:42:16):**  That's a great question.  I actually am still a little bit on your last question.  I sort of want to change my answer so I'm going to change my answer and then answer  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:42:24):**  this one because the answer around water is also kind of abstract like we want to be able  to measure things so that landowners can do this.  Another story that stuck in my mind I was talking with representatives of an Amazonian  
**[0:42:40-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:42:40):**  tribe a few weeks ago and he said you know we don't have any way to make money except  selling our culture right.  Selling it through medicine work essentially you know ayahuasca tourism and the sort of  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:42:56):**  like wisdom traditions that they still hold that they can derive economic value of and  that's where they make their money now and that's good in general like a lot of people  benefit from that compared to cutting down trees and forcing yeah but what would really  
**[0:43:12-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:43:12):**  support them is where they could get paid for doing the ecological stewardship that  they're already doing and so rewarding stewards for the work that they're already doing for  the preservation for the subtle things that we might not understand that's happening just  
**[0:43:35-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:43:35):**  for being there as keystone species within an ecosystem to remain and continue a way  of life that keeps human beings as part of the ecosystem that would be a really amazing  change and so where people are able to get paid for ecological restoration whether that's  
**[0:43:56-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:43:56):**  planting trees whether that's just doing sort of like agroforestry and harvesting within  a native landscape which is restoring water cycles which is collect being part of the  citizen science at biome where the people can just get paid for taking pictures of trees  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:44:14):**  that would fundamentally change hundreds of millions of livelihoods so that's another  thing the answer to the investor question what should we be looking at I mean there's  a saying right now that all investment is climate investment right now there's no way  
**[0:44:32-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:44:32):**  to make an investment in hard assets or in a tech company that doesn't take into consideration  the very real changing status of ecosystems and climate change impacts over the coming  decades so broadly everyone needs to be thinking about this I'm a big believer in technological  
**[0:44:59-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:44:59):**  solutions but I'm even a bigger believer in on the ground changes because climate change  is not a software problem it's a physical problem right it's that there's an actual  concrete balance imbalance in ecosystems and so carbon finance will be a really big area  
**[0:45:21-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:45:21):**  so de-risking the process for landowners to transition through regenerative agriculture  de-risking the process of deforestation so that will require maybe trillions of dollars  of project finance that will be highly highly profitable so if there are project finance  
**[0:45:38-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:45:38):**  people or infrastructure investors will also be releasing ways to finance and de-risk these  transitions through land os in future iterations of the platform so one come talk to us if  you want to be a partner in that the second is earthshod labs is raising a seed round  
**[0:45:56-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:45:56):**  right now so if you are listening to this in mid 2021 give us a call we're building  the coolest group of shareholders on earth that both share a deep care for the planet  so this is an impact story but also a sense of rigor and scale that will make this a very  
**[0:46:16-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:46:16):**  profitable investment and I would say the third category is doing actual on the ground  restoration projects because we see as we talked about earlier we see the biggest land  arbitrage opportunity that has ever existed on the planet because there are such degraded  
**[0:46:35-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:46:35):**  ecosystems that have sort of limited agricultural value and I'm thinking Australia, Southwest  Europe, the western United States, many many places throughout central and West Africa,  sub-saharan Africa, central America, places that have been so degraded over the last century  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:46:59):**  that the economic value of carbon sequestration and conservation is actually a positive rate  of return and so to do conservation in a way that is sensitive to local people's livelihoods  and multi-generational wealth of land stewardship but to do conservation at a really large scale  
**[0:47:19-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:47:19):**  we'll see massive massive opportunities both for investors and for grant making and non-profit  work.  What we see is that there's just not enough money in philanthropy right now to actually  
**[0:47:30-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:47:30):**  go address the size of the problem so that's why we are inviting investors to look at this  problem because hey if you can make a positive rate of return while doing conservation or  stacked agroforestry, conservation forestry where you're essentially getting agricultural  
**[0:47:48-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:47:48):**  products carbon credits and long-term forestry projects that eventually end up with an old  growth forest that's what we can see a lot of ecosystems transitioning into.  And what about you Patrick?  
**[0:48:00-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:48:00):**  Where would you point people to that are interested to get involved by investing their own wealth  or wealth they're managing?  Yeah I mean I would say first of all just to consider the context here I mean we're  
**[0:48:13-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:48:13):**  facing the greatest challenge that humanity has ever encountered and now is the time the  next 10 years are very very critical in terms of really standing up to that challenge and  so do you want to be a part of that?  
**[0:48:25-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:48:25):**  Do you as an investor want to play your part to be a part of the story that people are  going to tell about how humanity got together and really countered this challenge?  I think there's something here for everybody right if you're a tech if you're an early  
**[0:48:36-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:48:36):**  stage venture tech investor there are tons of really innovative people out there there's  many many different instances of people like us who step away from a career or I would  say speaking for myself who step away from career at tech careers at tech giants and  
**[0:48:51-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:48:51):**  investment funds and are really looking for to use our talents in ways that are that essentially  serve the environment and to serve facing this challenge and so everywhere you look  there are new startups that are thinking of innovative ways to counter climate change  
**[0:49:04-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:49:04):**  and to restore nature but also if you're let's say a mezzanine or a secondary debt lender  you know there's tons of opportunity there in terms of getting involved with land restoration  and you know that's what we'll be in a couple of years is raising significant amounts of  
**[0:49:19-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:49:19):**  capital in order to go and do things at planetary scale once we have our technology platform  really built out.  So there's something there for everyone I do think that there's a lot of innovation  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:49:29):**  that's going to be happening around things like restoring soil health and things like  really doing the specific forms of innovative intervention whether drawing from indigenous  knowledge or using the latest material science but there's just a lot out there and I think  
**[0:49:44-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:49:44):**  it's a case of not thinking about this as being some kind of ESG kind of concessionary  investing and more this is the next technology wave this is the next great wave of innovation  and economic opportunity and like like Troy was saying at this point everything has an  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:50:01):**  element of climate in it so why not dive in and be a core part of that solution.  Thank you both so much for your time I think that's a perfect moment to end I don't think  it's the last time we'll be talking and I'm looking forward to checking in over time as  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:50:14):**  as this develops and unfolds in ways we cannot predict yet but thank you for a very positive  episode which is not always the case and it's very nice to see the vision potential of land  and potentially the largest arbitrage or carbon arbitrage the world has ever seen so thank  
**[0:50:29-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:50:29):**  you so much for your time today.  Thanks so much for having us.  Yeah real pleasure really enjoyed the conversation.

**[0:51:26-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:51:26):**  How to put money to work in regenerating soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while  doing it.  Why are we doing this course after a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of  
**[0:51:36-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:51:36):**  audio asking the question how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been  following the space since 2011 and recording this podcast since 2016 we thought it was  time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:53:11-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:53:11):**  so you don't have to ride along.  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:53:23-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:53:23):**  invest in and what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could  find if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:53:34-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:53:34):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  
**[0:53:44-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:53:44):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/troy-carter-patrick-leung#t=0:53:52):**  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:00:37):**  agriculture and why regeneration is inevitable.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:00:41):**  I hope you enjoy this wide-ranging interview as much as I did recording it.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:00:47):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:00:52):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:00:53):**  This show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:00:58):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:01:03):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:01:07):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:01:10):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:01:13):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:01:16):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:01:21):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:01:25):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:01:49):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:01:50):**  So welcome to another episode today with Russ concert, co-founder of standard soil and blue  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:01:55):**  nest beef, feed the soil and nourish the world.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:01:58):**  Russ comes from a background of shell and is now laser focused on taste and birds.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:03):**  And obviously we're going to ask all about that.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:05):**  Welcome Russ.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:06):**  Hi, what a joy to be here.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:07):**  To start.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:08):**  I mean, I always ask this personal question.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:10):**  You come from a world of energy, shell, fossil fuels.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:14):**  How did you end up on?  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:15):**  I can imagine obviously because of climate and carbon, et cetera.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:19):**  But you have quite an interesting story there.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:20):**  Why did you, how did you end up on soil?  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:23):**  And then we get to the very first.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:25):**  The cut to the chase.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:26):**  Really.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:27):**  I spent 30 years figuring out how to take carbon out of the ground that was dead.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:30):**  And now I'm in the business realizing the potential to put living carbon back into the  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:35):**  soil.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:36):**  I've come to see in a very unusual way that these are all part of just the one big carbon  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:40):**  cycle that drives the overall health of planet earth.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:43):**  I'm an engineer by background.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:44):**  I'm sure that'll become visible as we chat.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:47):**  And I went into the energy industry in the 1970s because at that time the issue was like,  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:52):**  Hey, we're going to run out.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:53):**  We're not going to have enough.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:54):**  We had shortages and these were the big issues.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:02:57):**  We were certainly aware and thinking of clean and alternative, et cetera, at that time.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:02):**  But that wasn't the driver.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:04):**  But over the course of my career, got more deeply involved in that.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:08):**  I helped set up Shell's technology venturing group in the late 1990s, led a innovation  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:14):**  investment group called Game Changer through the 90s and into the early 2000s for a long  
**[0:03:19-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:19):**  time.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:20):**  And really got exposed to entrepreneurs in every facet of alternative energy systems,  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:26):**  biofuels, solar, wind, as well as novel approaches to oil and gas.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:30):**  And part of that was carbon sequestration.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:33):**  And we realized it was a really big problem, but it was a really tough problem.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:37):**  And we had invested in quite a number of ideas for taking carbon out of the air and none  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:43):**  were particularly compelling.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:46):**  And then I ran across some folks one day that said, Hey, we could take carbon out of the  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:50):**  air and store it in soil.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:52):**  My very deep background in oil and gas was measuring and counting carbon in the deep  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:56):**  earth.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:03:58):**  And when I went looking for data, I said, Holy cow, the quantity and distribution of  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:03):**  carbon in the earth was identical to the source rocks that were buried hundreds of millions  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:08):**  of years ago that later formed oil and gas.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:10):**  So literally what these regenerative farmers were doing was putting carbon back in the  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:14):**  earth right where it was put millions and millions of years ago.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:18):**  Can you explain it a bit?  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:19):**  What do you mean that the composition was the same for the non-engineers and the non-sourcers?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:23):**  What do you mean by the composition was the same?  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:25):**  Yeah, so oil and gas comes out of what we call source rocks.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:28):**  Source rocks are made of dead organic matter that was buried, decomposed, and cooked under  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:33):**  time, temperature, and pressure in the deep earth.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:36):**  And then a liquid or gas came out of it and floated up into a place where a guy like me  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:40):**  used to poke a hole in it to suck it out and refine it and put it in your tank.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:45):**  And literally, I still remember where I was sitting the day I got the first data set from  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:50):**  a farm in Australia.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:52):**  And I looked at the quantity and distribution of soil organic matter.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:55):**  And I go, I know exactly what this is.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:56):**  This looks just like the source rocks I used to measure and...  
**[0:04:59-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:04:59):**  A bit higher up.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:00):**  Yeah, a bit higher up.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:03):**  But morphologically, if you put it under a microscope, it looked identical.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:07):**  You had some sort of broader matrix, what we would call soil in the shallow earth, what  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:11):**  we would call a rock in the deep earth.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:13):**  And interspersed within it are these little particles of organic matter.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:16):**  So what it really did for me was appreciate not only the connectivity, but the do-ability  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:22):**  of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:23):**  Because these pioneers that were developing and deploying methods to put carbon back into  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:29):**  the soil weren't asking the planet to do anything it hadn't done for millions and millions of  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:34):**  years.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:35):**  It was really just tapping into the same natural force that's like the equivalent of water  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:39):**  running downhill.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:40):**  If water runs downhill and I come up with a plan to make water run downhill, you should  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:45):**  expect that that's a doable plan in some way.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:47):**  How fast, how much?  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:48):**  You got to do the math.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:50):**  But the basic mechanisms were entirely the most un-novel thing you could think of anyway.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:05:57):**  And you were in that office, saw that paper coming in, you thought, holy cow, I've seen  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:01):**  this before.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:03):**  That was quite a few years ago.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:04):**  So what happened after that?  
**[0:06:05-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:05):**  What happened in your life?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:06):**  What changed?  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:07):**  Did you go to Australia?  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:08):**  Did you visit this farmer?  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:11):**  What were the next steps?  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:12):**  Close.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:13):**  At the time, I had already decided I was going to retire from Shell and get involved in helping  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:17):**  renewable energy entrepreneurs mature their businesses.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:22):**  And I just had met a number of friends that kept pulling me into these questions about  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:25):**  the science and scalability of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:29):**  One in particular, my very dear friend, Peter Bick, he's a movie producer.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:32):**  I made a movie called Carbon Nation.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:34):**  I was in the process of making a new movie called Soil Carbon Cowboys at the time.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:38):**  And said, Ross, you need to come to this conference or this event.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:42):**  And I started doing that.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:43):**  And pretty soon, Peter and I were cooking up plans to do science projects and studies  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:48):**  along with some other colleagues.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:50):**  And again, I was kind of like the reluctant regenerative agriculture entrepreneur, if  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:55):**  you will.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:56):**  I was still spending most of my time working with renewable energy entrepreneurs.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:06:59):**  And then at some point, I really came to appreciate that these regenerative agriculture producers  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:07:06):**  were very much where the renewable energy entrepreneurs were, say, 20 years ago.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:07:11):**  They knew how to make these principles work on small scale in various places.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:07:15):**  But they really didn't lack, they really didn't yet have the business models and the resources  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:07:22):**  in which to kind of make it all come together and help it scale.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:07:26):**  So it's kind of the equivalent of back in the days when the only solar panels you would  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:07:30):**  find were on fence posts on farm gates or something, or the off-grid hermit.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:07:36):**  And so once I started to really spend time around these folks, I'm like, oh, man, the  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:07:41):**  economics of this as a business just, I mean, it makes sense.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:07:45):**  And what would it look like to create a business that would create value and profit by putting  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:07:50):**  carbon back into the ground in the same way we had previously taken it out of the ground?  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:07:55):**  That's where this name Standard Soil was born.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:07:57):**  It was like, what would it look like if John D. Rockefeller were to land back on the earth  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:03):**  and try to create a business to pump carbon back into the ground as fast as he took it  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:06):**  out?  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:07):**  And that made you almost reluctantly a regenerative agriculture entrepreneur.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:12):**  Right.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:13):**  So, I mean, Standard Soil has been around for a bit.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:16):**  What is Standard Soil at the moment?  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:18):**  We're talking June 2020.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:19):**  I mean, everything is fluid in these crazy times.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:22):**  But what is Standard Soil?  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:23):**  What do you spend most of your time on at Standard Soil?  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:27):**  Yeah, so we spent quite a bit of time trying to find the optimal business model to help  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:31):**  pump that carbon back into the ground fastest.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:33):**  And what we're working on exclusively at the moment, or nearly exclusively, maybe I'll  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:38):**  say is a direct-to-consumer grass-fed beef business.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:42):**  One of the really big challenges with regenerative agriculture is how to tell a story that engages  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:49):**  consumers that they can understand.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:51):**  I mean, you might get people enthusiastic about change, but who really knows what a  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:56):**  ton of carbon is, right?  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:08:57):**  You know, if you went to the store to buy a ton of carbon, what would you get?  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:01):**  And some of my colleagues here had already been working with the National Audubon Society,  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:05):**  who separately and simultaneously had come to the realization that grassland bird populations  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:12):**  were in steep decline due to industrial agriculture.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:16):**  In the United States or in North America, actually about 50% decline in the last 50  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:21):**  years.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:22):**  So that's total populations.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:23):**  And when they looked around and said, how do we work with people that manage land in  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:28):**  a way that could recreate grassland bird habitat, they of course landed on ranchers that are  
**[0:09:32-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:32):**  producing beef.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:33):**  So just to explain, because this is how we get to the birds, the Audubon Society is the  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:36):**  biggest association of people that are very interested and are caring about birds in the  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:42):**  US.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:43):**  It's more than one million members, right?  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:45):**  Yeah, more than a million members.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:46):**  Many millions of people engaged in the conversation started by John James Audubon many, many years  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:51):**  ago, famous naturalist.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:53):**  They landed, they figured out that we have to work with ranchers because they manage  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:57):**  so many grasslands.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:09:58):**  And that's one of the key areas where birds have been disappearing.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:01):**  Plus the area of opportunity for bird habitat to come up.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:06):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:07):**  The traditional method of conservation was one in which conservation groups goes and  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:10):**  buys a piece of land and regenerates, you know, protects the bird habitat, right?  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:15):**  Well, that's also resource limited.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:17):**  You can only buy as much land as you have a bank account.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:19):**  And they said, how do we create a market based incentive mechanism to work with private ranchers  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:24):**  where if they graze their animals in a way that's good for birds, they can be a part  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:30):**  of our program.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:31):**  And it was kind of certainly inspired by things like, you know, rainforest friendly coffee  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:36):**  and chocolate type things.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:37):**  But can we create this similar type thing for cattlemen and beef production, of course,  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:42):**  being their primary product.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:44):**  So to be able to create a certification system that you can then deliver to consumers.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:48):**  And it's been up and running for a couple of years now.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:50):**  And so you can find local regional farmers that are following these practices and buy  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:56):**  their beef.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:10:57):**  And for us, the challenge was like, how can we help you?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:00):**  This sounds really good because you have both a supply side and you have a customer base.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:06):**  But if you really want to make this thing work at scale, you got to figure out how to  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:09):**  aggregate that supply, process it, put it together, market it, ship it, all that stuff.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:15):**  So not just your local rancher that has been certified bird friendly or bird friendly and  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:20):**  extra habitat, et cetera, which we'll get into in a minute what that actually means.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:24):**  But you're saying there should be a brand on top of that aggregating the beef and making  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:28):**  sure that there's a market as well, not just a local market for the local rancher that  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:32):**  has the stamp.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:33):**  Adam, a marketed scale, I think one of the key words that we lose track of in regenerative  
**[0:11:38-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:38):**  agriculture is how to get this to scale.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:40):**  And the way we think of scale from an industrial perspective, again, I'm a mechanical engineer,  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:44):**  my background, big oil guy, right?  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:46):**  I think in terms of scale, we've got to build a big something, right?  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:51):**  And in today's industrial agriculture, that means the big thing is the feedlot and the  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:55):**  processing plant.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:11:56):**  And we've kind of seen how that thing, that model, is fragile in our food system, in our  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:01):**  current environment.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:03):**  But it came about because you need efficiencies that you can only get at scale.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:06):**  So how do you do that?  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:07):**  I mean, I tell people, hey, if you have a local rancher, especially that's Audubon certified,  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:12):**  that you can understand and develop a relationship to buy beef that's been produced in a way  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:17):**  in your ecosystem, that's doing good things for birds and good things for wildlife and  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:22):**  good things for carbon and all this kind of stuff, awesome, could do it.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:26):**  But that doesn't work for people in New York City, Miami, Boston, Washington, D.C., Los  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:30):**  Angeles, Houston, where I live.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:33):**  We've got large major urban population centers.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:36):**  And so we need scalable businesses that can do that.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:39):**  And that's what we're trying to do at Blue Nest Beef is create the scalable businesses.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:42):**  So now we work directly with the National Audubon Society to tell that story, to engage  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:47):**  consumers and try to bring impact.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:50):**  Because we have to take this whole regenerative agriculture thing from being a nice little  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:12:55):**  story and a few farms dotted here and there into the mainstream somehow.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:00):**  And so we got to get scale.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:01):**  I think we just have to get scale using different approaches than feedlots and CAFOs.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:06):**  So at the moment at Blue Nest Beef, I can order a package of beef if I'm living in a  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:12):**  major, let's say, urban area or anywhere in the U.S. and I get this beef from bird-friendly  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:18):**  certified ranchers, basically delivered to your step.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:21):**  That's it.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:22):**  You can't get it where you're at, but anywhere in the lower 48, we've had to exclude a lot  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:27):**  in Hawaii.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:28):**  Shipping frozen food is a little bit more complicated, those longer distances.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:32):**  But there you go.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:34):**  And I mean, I mentioned in the intro, we're going to unpack a lot of these things, but  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:37):**  you're very much focused on taste.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:39):**  Can you explain a bit, not necessarily the why, because I think the why is pretty clear  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:44):**  because it's very important and has to taste good.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:46):**  But how do you select on taste or where does that focus show that you are so much focused  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:50):**  on trying to get the best tasting grass-fed and grass-finished beef?  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:13:54):**  Yeah, well, of course, a lot of people think of animal genetics, which are important.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:14:00):**  But the thing that a lot of people don't realize is that a good taste starts in healthy soil  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:14:04):**  and healthy plants that grow in healthy soil.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:14:07):**  When you really start managing soil differently, what you're essentially doing is liberating  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:14:12):**  all of those other nutrients that are necessary to help different things grow.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:14:17):**  You know, all the carbon comes from the air, all the water comes from the pores in the  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:14:21):**  soil by way of rainfall or irrigation, but all of the other stuff, all the other things  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:14:26):**  that you see about in your nutrition analysis, the calcium, the magnesium, the iron, all  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:14:32):**  of that stuff starts in the soil.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:14:34):**  And so when you're managing food production systems in a way that regenerate healthy soil,  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:14:40):**  you're liberating that stuff, you're allowing the plant to thrive.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:14:43):**  So whatever eats the plants is now healthier, and this propagates down the value chain.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:14:49):**  One of my favorite authors and good friend, Dr. Fred Provenza, retired now from Utah State,  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:14:55):**  wrote a book called Nourishment.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:14:57):**  His research actually started with grazing goats who would self-select different browse,  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:04):**  different things to graze on based on taste.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:07):**  And it turns out that that taste is very deeply connected to nutrition and even medicinal  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:12):**  properties that the goat would need to optimize its own health.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:16):**  And as human beings, we've evolved in the same type of ecosystem.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:20):**  What you and I say tastes good is really your body's way of telling you that, oh, there's  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:26):**  nourishment in that food for you.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:28):**  Another relevant author here, I got my name from Mark Shasker, wrote a book called The  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:33):**  Dorito Effect.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:35):**  It actually chronicled Fred's story a little bit in that story.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:38):**  He said, one way to look at where we started to go wrong in our food system is when we  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:43):**  started decoupling taste from nutrition.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:46):**  So the moment we started lying to our taste buds.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:49):**  What do you mean by lying?  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:50):**  Lying.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:51):**  So deceiving a taste bud.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:52):**  You add something that adds flavor and delightfulness to the human body, but there's no nutrition.  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:57):**  No nutrition.  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:58):**  Empty.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:15:59):**  You decouple that.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:00):**  Whereas when you get back into real whole food, I just had some fillets off of our beef  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:05):**  here last weekend, by far, and I've been in the grass-fed beef business for a while.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:10):**  The most amazing beef I've ever had.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:13):**  My body, when you take a bite of real whole food that's produced from healthy soil, your  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:18):**  body goes, wow.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:20):**  I think it goes wow now because we've lost that.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:23):**  I had a customer here two weeks ago send an email saying, my wife was raised in France  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:30):**  and when we were cooking the steaks, it reminded her of the smell in her grandmother's kitchen.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:35):**  When we ate them, the flavor was exceptional.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:39):**  Is it something that's a risk in a sense that we've been lied to, or our taste buds, and  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:43):**  that's us, have been lied to so much that we sort of like the taste now of certain salty,  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:49):**  sweet, sugary things, and maybe we're not able to distinguish the real taste and that's  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:54):**  the real nutrition?  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:56):**  Are we easily fooled at the moment?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:16:58):**  We are easily fooled, but it's also, my experience so far is backed up Fred's research.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:04):**  One of the phrases he talks about Fred Provenza here is the wisdom of the body, that it's  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:07):**  still there.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:08):**  We didn't breed it out of our system.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:11):**  It's a joy when we've done little tasting things for customers and it doesn't matter  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:16):**  whether you're three years old, 30 years old, or 80 years old.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:20):**  When you taste real whole food and your body goes, wow, I didn't remember that that's what  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:25):**  it was.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:26):**  So it's still in there.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:27):**  You just have to get out of that Dorito effect mindset, which is short term delight without  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:33):**  nutrition.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:34):**  I honestly think the raging diet wars are really annoying, right?  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:38):**  Eat this, don't eat that.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:41):**  But if people were to just eat real whole food and let their bodies select what they  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:45):**  need based on taste, I think we'd all be so radically healthier, we could start shutting  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:50):**  down hospitals, right?  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:51):**  Because they think our bodies are still wired to do this really, really well.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:17:56):**  Now it still takes people, the heroes in regenerative agriculture, the farmers, they're not the  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:02):**  investors, they're not the entrepreneurs like me, the people who, the hard work is the farmer  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:06):**  out in the field looking at their ecosystem and what they have to work with, their soil  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:12):**  types, their animals, their environment, the rainfall.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:15):**  How do I optimize this system to maximize the expression of healthy food that comes  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:21):**  from it?  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:22):**  And they'll be reading things like the diversity of forage, the properties of the soil, is  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:27):**  it getting softer, the smell of the soil.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:29):**  But at the end of the day, that all shows up as flavor in food that people like you  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:34):**  and I can recognize.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:35):**  And even in our business, I've always known it intellectually, but over the course of  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:40):**  the last six months, I would say I've heightened my practical appreciation for the full lifecycle  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:45):**  role of processing.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:47):**  We're working exclusively with a processor by the name of Lawrence Meats in Cannon Falls,  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:53):**  Minnesota.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:54):**  They were profiled by Michael Pollan in the Omnivore's Dilemma as the class abattoir  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:18:58):**  for their ethic and sustainability approach.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:01):**  And Mike and Rob Lawrence and their team are so amazing.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:05):**  The respect and care they give the animals and how it's treated through that lifecycle.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:10):**  We've always said it, but now I really believe it, that every step matters in preserving  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:16):**  that flavor and nutrition.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:17):**  If the animal is stressed prior to processing, you'll detect it as an off flavor.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:23):**  And this is part of the challenge in developing regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:26):**  We have to- In terms of scale, in terms of, yeah, you  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:29):**  don't want to go to that massive plant that are all shut down now because of COVID, but  
**[0:19:33-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:33):**  yeah.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:34):**  So to borrow from a relevant and analogous industry, if what we're trying to do is the  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:40):**  equivalent of electrifying transport, we need to make it so that when people get into an  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:44):**  electric vehicle, it doesn't feel like a cheap compromise.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:47):**  It's like, wow, that's amazing.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:49):**  So that's what Tesla did to the world for us is their mission was to really accelerate  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:54):**  this transition to electrification of mobility.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:19:57):**  But what they did was design and deliver an amazing car.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:01):**  You sit in it and you go, wow, that's a really good car.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:03):**  You drive it and you go, that's an amazing car.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:06):**  And I think that's what we have to do in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:09):**  And I think the tool that we have to work with is a taste and flavor and aroma and these  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:13):**  very human senses.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:15):**  And then it'll show up in terms of improved performance.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:18):**  And I tell people in my own journey, I spent 50 years not realizing as a child of the 60s  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:25):**  eating processed food, Kraft macaroni and cheese and Tang as a substitute for orange  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:30):**  juice.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:31):**  And I actually loved spam when I was a little kid.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:34):**  These kinds of things are relics of the mindset that we had, which is we could industrially  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:38):**  replicate anything.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:41):**  And what I discovered about 10 years ago is that nature figured this out all along and  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:45):**  we just lost track of it.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:47):**  So all we need to do is rediscover it.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:49):**  And then I think as entrepreneurs, our role is how to invent and allow business models  
**[0:20:52-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:20:52):**  that can make this viable, compelling, convenient, accessible, all these things.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:00):**  That's the role of the entrepreneur and the investor here.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:02):**  But the heroes are the farmers.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:03):**  They're the ones that are reading the landscape, integrating the animals.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:07):**  And the missing ingredient, frankly, is the consumer, the consumer who gives a damn.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:12):**  It's been really fun on this journey with Lune's beef.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:16):**  What we need most are thoughtful consumers that give a damn, that they care about where  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:20):**  their food is coming from.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:21):**  They care about its story, its impact on ecosystems, its impact on their health.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:27):**  And I don't get frustrated with vegans and vegetarians because most of them are thoughtful  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:31):**  leaders.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:32):**  I get frustrated with what I call careless carnivores, which are people that are just  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:36):**  like giving the cheap stuff and they can't see the system that's around that that causes  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:41):**  problems.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:42):**  And I realize it kind of is what it is now.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:45):**  And again, that's where us entrepreneurs come in, is we have to develop systems that at  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:49):**  some point, by starting with the people that can really appreciate and be thoughtful about  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:53):**  food, can help this thing scale.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:56):**  And someday you won't even have to be a thoughtful carnivore.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:21:59):**  It'll be the better way that we produce food.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:01):**  But of course, it's the way we produce food in a way that restores soil instead of degrading  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:07):**  it.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:08):**  So I mean, this is decades and centuries long transition.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:11):**  I don't know if you're familiar with an author by the name of David Montgomery, written several  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:16):**  books lately, very importantly, I think foundational.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:19):**  We had him on the show almost at the beginning, I think I'm going to say episode 27 or something  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:24):**  in that row.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:25):**  Very early on, right?  
**[0:22:26-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:26):**  Very early on.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:28):**  But the growing revolution was already out.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:30):**  Growing revolution is that I always tell people go back and read Dirt, the Erosion of Civilization.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:33):**  Yeah, which is very good.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:35):**  But David's story is one in civilization as a whole without realizing it was based on  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:41):**  a business model of exploiting the organic matter in soil until we had to plead for centuries.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:47):**  I mean, people say, oh, but the agriculture changed the last 50 years, which is absolutely  
**[0:22:51-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:51):**  true.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:52):**  We speed up the process, but the extraction, except for some exceptions, I mean, there's  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:22:57):**  some especially indigenous peoples that have been, let's say, sustainable, in some cases,  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:01):**  even regenerative.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:02):**  But that's it, that's some kind of exception somewhere.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:05):**  We've mostly been extracted for the last, since whatever we invented agriculture 12,000  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:10):**  years ago.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:11):**  This has been a downhill battle, which we're losing.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:14):**  And it's, yeah, it's...  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:16):**  And it wasn't my designer intent, right?  
**[0:23:18-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:18):**  It was a mental problem.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:19):**  No, we didn't know.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:20):**  I mean, we maybe knew a bit, but it was too slow to really see.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:24):**  I mean, soil erosion, like a millimeter a year.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:27):**  How much do you see about that?  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:28):**  Except in a generation, you see suddenly the tree doesn't have roots anymore.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:31):**  Right.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:32):**  There's no roots, which is a problem.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:33):**  You see the roots are exposed now, but yeah, you don't see it.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:36):**  I mean, it's not like somebody woke up 10,000 years ago and said, let's deplete the soil.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:40):**  It's just like, it was there.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:42):**  Let's do annuals instead of perennials.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:44):**  And then when this one wore out, you went here.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:46):**  And that worked fine, I like to say, as long as there was another Iowa out there somewhere,  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:51):**  right?  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:52):**  So living in North America here, it was really a great resource exploitation of a country  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:23:57):**  that had rich soil that kept us running for the last several hundred years.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:02):**  But now, I mean, I grew up in Nebraska, I went to school in Iowa, we're pretty much,  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:05):**  we're getting close to running out of Iowa.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:08):**  And so the new conversation is by people, you know, I love the movie Interstellar because  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:13):**  it fictionalizes this story of we've ruined the soil on planet Earth, so we have to move  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:16):**  to the stars.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:18):**  What I've learned by spending time with these regenerative farmers that gave grounds to  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:22):**  Alan Williams, the Ray Archuletas of the world, these are the folks that like, oh, no, we  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:27):**  can fix this.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:28):**  In fact, I've kind of flipped the story in my own mind.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:31):**  We don't have to leave the Earth to find the next Iowa on Mars, if it were.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:37):**  We can't have any hope of making Mars work unless we figure out how to make Earth the  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:41):**  easy one work first.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:42):**  And so the good news is in spending time on the ground with these folks, the hard part  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:48):**  is changing how you think, which is really, as some people say, changing how you see.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:53):**  But once you can do that...  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:54):**  What do you mean?  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:55):**  What should it change in?  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:56):**  What is A or B?  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:57):**  What is before and after?  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:24:58):**  What do you say, 10 years ago or maybe even 15, whenever you got that paper?  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:02):**  The farmer will say that it's a big flip of tactical things like shifting the mindset  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:08):**  from what do I need to kill today to get more of what I want to grow.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:12):**  And the shift is to now how do I enable what I want to grow more, so the positive, the  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:18):**  affirmative, and to bring an imbalance with the other stuff.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:21):**  And even, I mean, the insightful people no longer see weeds as the enemy.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:25):**  They see weeds as the first responders, right?  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:28):**  The weeds are the things that nature brings in first when the soil is broken to start  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:31):**  life growing again.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:33):**  There's some functional physiological reasons for that.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:37):**  There's a role.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:38):**  Yeah, there's a role.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:39):**  But it's step one.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:40):**  And then you have to, as the land manager or farmer, you think about step two, three,  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:43):**  four, five, 15 down the line, but it's a continue or it's a transition.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:47):**  Yeah, you have to learn to think in systems.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:49):**  So maybe the thing that's really understandable by people now, because it's been so big in  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:53):**  the last decade, is the study of human microbiome research, right?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:25:58):**  Where germ theory, for a long time, we thought like germs are bad.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:03):**  Let's kill everything.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:04):**  We're going to do whatever.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:06):**  And we started to realize we actually, what we did was create evolutionary pressure for  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:10):**  some of the things we didn't want.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:12):**  So we get intestinal infections of Clostridium difficile, right?  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:17):**  C. diff.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:18):**  And what we did was we brought that out of balance.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:20):**  So it wasn't that we had too much of something we needed to kill.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:24):**  We were missing the things that would naturally keep it in balance.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:27):**  So the more general abstraction of this, I like to say is, and I feel I come from this  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:33):**  disease myself, if you will, is we have to learn to think in loops instead of lines.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:38):**  The linear way we've been thinking since the dawn of civilization is we take an input,  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:43):**  we do something to it, we get an output.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:45):**  And everything else is somebody else's problems.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:48):**  But nature doesn't work that way.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:50):**  Everything is connected to everything else.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:51):**  And the output of one thing is an input to another, and it's all interdependent.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:26:55):**  And that learning to think in loops instead of lines is a fundamental skill that most  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:01):**  in Western civilization just haven't cultivated.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:04):**  You mentioned the indigenous peoples.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:05):**  I think this is the real advantage of indigenous thinking.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:10):**  Indigenous peoples all around the world have held on to the ability to see systems, to  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:14):**  see relationships.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:16):**  And so I think we have to rediscover and reconsolidate and re-expand these ways of thinking in order  
**[0:27:25-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:25):**  to kind of create a regenerative future.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:27):**  Which is, I mean, some huge steps you made as an engineer going from very machine thinking,  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:33):**  input and output to much more systems thinking and circles and loops instead of lines.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:39):**  And you ended up selling beef.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:41):**  And I think I want to, I get it.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:43):**  I wouldn't say pause there, but actually dig a bit deeper into that because I can already  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:48):**  imagine obviously the mentioned vegan and vegetarians.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:52):**  Okay, great.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:27:54):**  But why beef and why not regenerative grain, perennial crops in a certain trees in a certain  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:01):**  way?  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:02):**  What draw you to the livestock industry, which can have a huge environmental positive impact  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:08):**  when we see the LCA is coming out, we're going to discuss methane and we're going to get  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:12):**  into that.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:13):**  But what ended up for you basically drawing in and slowly getting closer to the livestock  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:19):**  side of things?  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:21):**  Short answer, land area and rates.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:23):**  When you look at planet earth, the grassland ecosystems constitute a very large fraction.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:30):**  Really comparable.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:31):**  So scale.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:32):**  There's a really important, it's a bit technical scientific insight here in that grasslands  
**[0:28:37-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:37):**  are a fairly modern evolutionary invention.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:40):**  They've only really evolved in the last 30 million years worldwide.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:44):**  Grasses is a species.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:45):**  You can trace the roots back into the cretaceous, but not any further.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:48):**  They didn't expand into the Eocene and then later the myocene.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:53):**  And it's because what happened was grasses invented a different way to do photosynthesis.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:28:58):**  Compared to trees or others.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:00):**  Yeah, trees.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:03):**  Most photosynthetic organisms on planet earth work along a pathway called C3 photosynthesis  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:09):**  and grasses figured out this trick called C4 photosynthesis.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:13):**  It basically, in C3 photosynthesis, the plant can get confused about whether it's trying  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:21):**  to grab onto an oxygen or a CO2 molecule.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:23):**  And so it kind of loses efficiency.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:25):**  In C4 photosynthesis, it kind of puts a front end filter on that.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:29):**  It separates the CO2 from the oxygen and then it does the rest of its metabolism.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:34):**  And what that meant.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:35):**  It meant faster biomass growth and root growth.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:40):**  And the process by which a plant does photosynthesis requires evapotranspiration.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:45):**  The plant basically gives off water in order to bring in CO2.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:48):**  And so C3 photosynthesis didn't really work well in continental inlands.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:52):**  When grasses kind of evolved, they figured out how to conquer these continental inlands  
**[0:29:57-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:57):**  and cover very large ecosystems on planet earth.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:29:59):**  They also developed traits, for example, coexistence with fire, number one, which is if you can  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:05):**  just kind of imagine a fire running into an ecosystem that has both grasses and trees,  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:08):**  the grass grows back faster than the trees, right?  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:11):**  So there's an evolutionary advantage.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:13):**  The important one here is the evolution of grazing ruminants.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:17):**  So grazing ruminants in a natural ecosystem, we have dense herds roaming frequently, come  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:22):**  in and eat the nutritious part of the grass, say the top half for simplicity.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:28):**  And what that does is cause the grass to go back into a growth mode, which is like, hey,  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:33):**  I need to catch more sunshine again.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:35):**  Instead of produce seeds.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:36):**  And so the symbiotic relationship between grazing ruminants and grasses is a really  
**[0:30:41-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:41):**  good photosynthesis engine.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:43):**  And photosynthesis is the primary process by which planet earth takes up carbon and  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:47):**  then does something with it.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:49):**  The other advantage that grasses have is as perennial systems with dense root systems,  
**[0:30:56-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:56):**  they have a really symbiotic relationship with the soil.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:30:59):**  So within a very narrow sphere or narrow volume in the soil, you have all these reactions  
**[0:31:05-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:31:05):**  that show up on your food as taste, but really it's the biology of buying and selling micronutrients  
**[0:31:13-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:31:13):**  to help the plant grow.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:31:15):**  And so the ruminant really is kind of a tactical contributor to a system that helps the earth  
**[0:31:21-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:31:21):**  capture more sunshine.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:31:23):**  And that's literally why I ended up with grass because grass and cows are a formula to capture  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:31:30):**  a whole bunch of carbon in soil fast or grass and cows and sheep and any other ruminants.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:31:35):**  Now it's not at all exclusive.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:31:38):**  So this relationship can work in savannas and it can be present in other ecosystems  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:31:44):**  as well.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:31:45):**  And if you start going down the path, you'll realize that all of nature is kind of doing  
**[0:31:49-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:31:49):**  the same thing.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:31:50):**  You're participating in this bio-economy of loops that are feeding each other in a system.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:31:57):**  And then the role of whatever the agent is, and I would argue now it's humans, is those  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:04):**  species that figure out how to participate in that ecosystem to help it grow more, you  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:10):**  get more of those.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:11):**  Evolution says, I like that.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:12):**  You can reproduce, you're nourished, you can have children, you can have more of that.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:17):**  And species that don't help that happen, they get kind of winnowed out of the system over  
**[0:32:22-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:22):**  time.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:23):**  And I honestly think it's a bit of a, I know it sounds like a bit of a leap, I think that's  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:26):**  exactly what we face as a human species right now is where we've gone through 10,000 years  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:31):**  is a tiny, tiny little fraction of earth's history.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:34):**  We've unintentionally inhibited the capacity of the planet to capture and cycle sunshine.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:40):**  And the choice sitting right now in front of us with regenerative agriculture is how  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:44):**  to help earth do what she wants to do more.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:47):**  And if we help her do that, she's going to say, I like you, please.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:52):**  And if we don't?  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:53):**  And if we don't, well, she'll replace us with something else at some point.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:32:57):**  Meaning you're suggesting that if we don't act as the agent to help speed up regeneration  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:03):**  or speed up biomass production and to maximize growth of life, we at some point will be replaced  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:10):**  by something else that will do that for nature.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:13):**  Yeah, if you zoom out to the, and I realize I'm like worse than a helicopter.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:18):**  I'm more like a helicopter with a jet engine going up and down sometimes.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:22):**  That's why we have the space in this interview.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:24):**  That's why I don't do four months.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:25):**  People would have switched out by now if they didn't care.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:28):**  The only place that the input really matters is at the outer interface of the planet as  
**[0:33:33-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:33):**  a whole.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:34):**  So the upper atmosphere where the sunshine comes in, if you look at the earth and although  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:38):**  it's not completely irrelevant, I think from a volumetric flow, we'll put it aside for  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:43):**  now.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:44):**  Comets and meteors and things like that, they're meteors that might bring exogenous material  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:47):**  to the planet.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:49):**  We can put that aside for now.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:51):**  Really the only true input to planet earth is solar energy.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:33:55):**  And earth has evolved as, you know, it's a very close cousin to the concepts of James  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:00):**  Lovelock and Lynn Margulis of Gaia theory as an organism that moves out of equilibrium  
**[0:34:06-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:06):**  that helps life cycle.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:07):**  And that's kind of the long arrow, the long arc of evolutionary biology on planet earth.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:14):**  And yeah, I mean, I'm not trying to be fatalistic.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:17):**  These cycles are really, really long, right?  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:19):**  It seems like a long time ago when the pyramids were built, but in the scope of earth history,  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:24):**  it was yesterday.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:25):**  And so in general, I think we can see that in the history of the earth, those species  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:31):**  that continue to help the earth do what it wants to do, which is capture its one and  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:36):**  true only input, will be rewarded with prosperity.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:40):**  And if not, at best you're fighting it, right?  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:43):**  To me, the way, you know, my friend Gabe Brown says, you know, I'd rather sign the back of  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:47):**  the check than the front.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:49):**  And I think that's exactly the right way to think of regenerative agriculture as a farmer.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:53):**  But I think it applies to civilization as well.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:34:56):**  If we can work with the natural forces of the universe to help earth do what it wants  
**[0:35:01-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:01):**  to do, nature will be writing us the checks and prosperity, however that's defined, will  
**[0:35:09-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:09):**  continue.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:11):**  Probably not just in monetary terms.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:13):**  It's exactly the thing you mentioned before on farmers, like the mind shift of seeing,  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:18):**  of fighting and killing what wants to live on your land, in this case weeds or other  
**[0:35:24-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:24):**  and infestants, et cetera, and desperately trying to keep something alive that wants  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:29):**  to die and fighting or flowing with or seeing what emerges, et cetera, which all sounds  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:34):**  very nice in theory.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:35):**  And I know the practice is very different, but it is that mind shift of seeing what actually  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:40):**  wants to emerge here, wants to grow here.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:43):**  And it's the same that you hear every regenerative farmers say, like, I never expected to grow  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:47):**  X, Y, Z here, but it does really well.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:50):**  Just I'm facilitating that, a herder, not someone that plants or grows or kills in that  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:56):**  sense.  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:57):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:35:58):**  And the farmer is trying to read the flows of nature.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:01):**  Again, as an engineer, what I can see is that that's all about-  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:04):**  And capture as much sunlight as possible.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:06):**  That's the-  
**[0:36:07-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:07):**  And capture as much sunlight as possible.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:09):**  And then things like soil, soil is the battery of this system.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:13):**  This is the thing where the solar energy gets stored and exchanged in this ecosystem.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:17):**  We then count it up and attribute it to sequestration as carbon because there really is carbon that's  
**[0:36:22-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:22):**  held.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:23):**  What we're really doing is just taking a snapshot of a component of an overall ecosystem.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:28):**  That's working better.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:30):**  And the farmers that figure this out, they generally find better businesses on their  
**[0:36:33-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:33):**  farms.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:34):**  They find better happiness.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:36):**  They're not stressed by fighting the flows of nature.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:39):**  I think there's a survey of Gabriel, I'm going to find it for the show notes, but that they  
**[0:36:44-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:44):**  surveyed the happiness of farmers and the relaxedness and is farming fun.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:47):**  And the regenerative ones were obviously saying, they did the surveys, obviously they surveyed,  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:52):**  but they were generally much happier than the conventional extractive.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:56):**  I don't like the word convention.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:36:57):**  I always like to say extractive ones that haven't made the transition yet, but maybe  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:01):**  we're thinking otherwise they wouldn't be surveyed.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:03):**  But you could see that happiness is very, very different.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:06):**  I think if you look at stress levels, et cetera, of regenerative farmers, you would find much  
**[0:37:11-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:11):**  lower levels.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:12):**  I'm making a big assumption.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:13):**  Email me if you have those research because we'd love to see it.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:19):**  And I think those are good.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:20):**  And with those kinds of thoughts in mind, I still think our role as entrepreneurs is  
**[0:37:24-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:24):**  to figure out how to allow those things to come into being given that reality.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:30):**  Given the current economic system we're in where carbon is not a currency, but money  
**[0:37:34-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:34):**  is a currency.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:35):**  And that might change in the long run because we're in the long run, but for now it's not.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:39):**  So if you want to help these farmers, and I'm going to get back to the methane piece.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:44):**  I know we skipped that, but if you want to help these farmers, you figured, okay, you  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:47):**  need to help them sell beef.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:49):**  When did you see that the Burt-Friendly was very close?  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:53):**  Is it exactly the same?  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:54):**  Like if you're very advanced as regenerative farmer, rancher, in this case livestock, are  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:37:58):**  you automatically very good for birds or is it also the other way around?  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:01):**  Like you're very good for birds automatically you're storing a lot of carbon or there's  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:04):**  some small nuances there that are different.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:07):**  There's quite a bit of nuance in there.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:09):**  If you're a regenerative farmer, you're almost certainly good for birds.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:13):**  You can do good things for birds without necessarily being fully regenerative.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:17):**  Okay.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:18):**  So you selected the ones that were certified.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:22):**  And what I'd say is as an engineer, one of the part of my DNA that I still carry with  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:26):**  me is a sense of pragmatism, which we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:31):**  So if we can start with birds and practices that are good for birds and bring farmers  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:36):**  on a journey to improve practices that over time become more and more regenerative.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:40):**  I bet it tastes.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:41):**  And then we're moving the needle in the right direction.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:44):**  And in the near term, I can work with the farmers in a very simplistic, mechanistic  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:49):**  way.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:50):**  They follow the protocols, they get certified by Audubon.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:54):**  There's another third party certifier in there that ensures compliance.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:38:59):**  But what really makes it compelling for them is that I can show up at the gate and say,  
**[0:39:03-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:03):**  because you've done that, I can pay you more for your cattle.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:06):**  So I can pay you a premium.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:09):**  And we're not asking people to do this out of the goodness of their heart.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:12):**  I tell people I live here in Texas and I laugh back in my dead carbon days.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:18):**  I was leading a production team out in West Texas and we were thinking about what are  
**[0:39:22-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:22):**  we going to do?  
**[0:39:23-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:23):**  Nobody's paying as much for oil anymore.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:25):**  This was the early 1990s.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:28):**  And one of the guys in the room said, why don't we throw up a windmill?  
**[0:39:31-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:31):**  Maybe people will pay us to make wind power.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:32):**  And we all, nah, that'll never work.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:35):**  And now of course you drive it.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:36):**  And now Texas is a huge wind state at the moment.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:38):**  Right.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:39):**  And it's not like Texas got religion about renewable energy.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:41):**  No, no, it's 30 years in technology.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:44):**  The landowners said, you'll pay me money for putting up a windmill?  
**[0:39:47-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:47):**  I'm in for that.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:48):**  And then the entrepreneurs figured out how to bring in investors and wrap in business  
**[0:39:52-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:52):**  models and secure power purchase agreements to make that kind of stuff viable and happen.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:39:58):**  And it's been a 20 year journey to do that.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:00):**  Right.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:01):**  And you've mentioned in the pre call we did that you expect, because we mentioned affordability  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:05):**  like one or two times, you we've discussed taste and almost exclusivity.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:11):**  Like the currently the prices I think you're charging for, correct me if I'm wrong, are  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:14):**  definitely above the supermarket part, the supermarket meat that you use.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:19):**  That's my, I wouldn't say my enemy, but it's the client that buys that without thinking  
**[0:40:22-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:22):**  about it.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:23):**  That's the worst.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:24):**  But you also said like in the age or 10 years, I think that grass fat and grass finished  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:28):**  and let's say holistically managed or paddock, whatever term we put on it, let's say soil  
**[0:40:33-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:33):**  friendly is going to be cheaper than CAFOs and factory farms.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:37):**  Where do you see that happening?  
**[0:40:38-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:38):**  Do you see that?  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:40):**  Because it's the same maybe 30 years as wind.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:42):**  Where do you see the biggest shifts there?  
**[0:40:44-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:44):**  The potential to make it affordable or maybe raise the other prices?  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:47):**  I don't know where the difference is going to be.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:51):**  In renewable energy world, we had this phrase called grid parity.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:53):**  We've kind of forgotten now because we've already passed it.  
**[0:40:56-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:56):**  We didn't do a party for that.  
**[0:40:57-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:57):**  We should have done that.  
**[0:40:58-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:58):**  We should have.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:40:59):**  We've talked about it for 20 years and then we managed in many places and we sort of,  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:03):**  ah yeah, that was fun.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:05):**  That's a lot of work.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:06):**  There was air right now.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:07):**  Now coal is irrelevant.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:08):**  People are still trying to pretend they're killing it.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:10):**  The power market in most places is an interplay between solar and wind and natural gas and  
**[0:41:16-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:16):**  a remaining residual base load of nuclear if it happens to be present.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:20):**  I think here what we're talking about is regenerative parity or CAFO parity.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:25):**  Maybe we need to coin the right phrase.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:27):**  I think operationally it's doable within eight to 10 years on any given property, but in  
**[0:41:32-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:32):**  aggregate to reach it would be much further out.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:36):**  The real unbeatable advantage of regenerative agriculture is that once you start managing  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:42):**  the system of life to capture more sunshine by storing energy in the soil carbon battery,  
**[0:41:48-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:48):**  that you can grow more life.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:51):**  Industrial agriculture today is based on a linear mindset that's a once and done thing.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:41:56):**  I go in the spring, I till, I plant, I let it grow, I harvest, I'm done.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:00):**  I come back next spring and do it all over again.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:02):**  I bring it to a CAFO and yeah, feed it to.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:05):**  No matter what you do, you invent better and better fertilizers, whatever, you're going  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:09):**  to get an asymptotic yield system out of that and it's going to fall prey to the gravity  
**[0:42:15-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:15):**  of, let's call it the David Montgomery effect of depleted soil at some point where you're  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:21):**  having to add more and more inputs to compensate for the lost natural assets and it hits a  
**[0:42:26-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:26):**  wall.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:27):**  With regeneration, what we typically see is that the leading producers here can go into  
**[0:42:32-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:32):**  a piece of land and increase the overall productivity of that piece of land by a factor of say two  
**[0:42:37-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:37):**  to three, sometimes more.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:39):**  In what time period?  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:40):**  In that eight to 10 year time period, within 10 years.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:44):**  In some places where you have good moisture to work with, you might be able to do something  
**[0:42:47-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:47):**  in five, but it's really remarkable to see what, again, these people are my heroes, right?  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:52):**  I mean, we need to dress Gabe Brown and friends in Avenger costumes or something.  
**[0:42:57-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:57):**  I don't know.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:42:58):**  They would like that, but I don't know if the picture would look good.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:03):**  These folks that are listening to their ecosystems and working, it's really remarkable once you  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:07):**  understand how to do it, how fast you can turn around any given piece of land.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:11):**  Why do you think there's so much pushback?  
**[0:43:15-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:15):**  There are not enough peer reviewed studies.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:17):**  What about the methane?  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:19):**  What about the climate impact of all this livestock isn't livestock the huge enemy?  
**[0:43:23-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:23):**  Yeah, Gabe Brown is doing funny things, but it doesn't scare me.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:26):**  There's such an enormous pushback from, I don't know where, I mean, I see it a lot on  
**[0:43:30-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:30):**  Twitter, et cetera, but where's that coming from?  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:33):**  Well, what I would say is you have to distinguish between legitimate pushback and good questions.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:38):**  We'll come back to the scale one that you mentioned there at the end, because that's  
**[0:43:40-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:40):**  where my focus is.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:41):**  How do we scale this?  
**[0:43:43-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:43):**  The other stuff, the type of science we have to do here is observational science of functioning  
**[0:43:50-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:50):**  ecosystems.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:51):**  The early people that tried to study the science of this tried to break it down into a few  
**[0:43:54-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:54):**  key components and control it.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:43:56):**  In the process, you inevitably break the ecosystem of the leading practitioners are effectively  
**[0:44:02-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:02):**  managing all the other.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:03):**  Meaning you would basically not decrease, like you're going to just study one piece  
**[0:44:08-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:08):**  of a very complex rotation, for instance.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:10):**  I'm going to take that 10 acres, I'm going to put 50 cows on it, I'm going to take this  
**[0:44:14-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:14):**  10 acres and put 100 on it.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:16):**  Everything else is going to be the same, and then we're going to compare the two.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:20):**  That's what we call reductionist science.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:22):**  It doesn't take into account that over here on this 10 acres that some regenerative farmer  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:27):**  is reading the system every day and trying to figure out how do I manage it so it can  
**[0:44:31-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:31):**  capture more sunshine and store carbon and soil.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:35):**  It's always going to have this functional limitation that observational research is  
**[0:44:40-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:40):**  really the only way to do it.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:42):**  That means if it's observational research, somebody has to do it first and then somebody  
**[0:44:45-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:45):**  has to follow them and study it.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:47):**  The research, the science will follow the practitioners.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:50):**  I'm involved with a science project here led by my friend, Peter Bick, who's a movie producer,  
**[0:44:56-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:44:56):**  also at Arizona State, funding from the Foundation of Future Agriculture Research, McDonald's,  
**[0:45:01-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:01):**  and some others to study comparison ranchers.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:04):**  Just to go on record here, McDonald's is investing in the future of beef.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:09):**  That's very interesting.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:10):**  Yeah, McDonald's is investing in trying to figure out how we can make viable supply chains  
**[0:45:16-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:16):**  for regenerative beef.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:17):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:18):**  Let's give him some credit where it's due.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:21):**  Yeah, as a guy who used to live inside of the big bad whatever, oil in my case, but  
**[0:45:28-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:28):**  pick your big bad ag, big bad pharma, whatever, I've learned that these companies and organizations  
**[0:45:34-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:34):**  are just like you and me.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:36):**  They're trying to do their best every day.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:38):**  They just unintentionally often caught in paradigms and incentives that keep them where  
**[0:45:41-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:41):**  they are from exploring new things.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:44):**  In the case of McDonald's, the question legitimately will be scale, right?  
**[0:45:48-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:48):**  It doesn't really matter if Gabe Brown is running a herd of a couple hundred head.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:53):**  How do we get, I don't know how many Gabe Browns.  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:56):**  Let's get into that.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:45:57):**  Then we touch upon the methane one because I keep promising, maybe people keep still  
**[0:46:00-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:00):**  listening about the methane.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:02):**  I will link your, you have a great TEDx talk on methane and all the questions around it,  
**[0:46:05-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:05):**  which I will link definitely below, but we can do a few summaries of that.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:08):**  Let's first tackle scale.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:09):**  It doesn't matter if Gabe Brown is great.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:12):**  Doesn't even matter if he's double the size.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:14):**  That's what you've been focusing on.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:16):**  How do we get to the acres or the acreage we need to have an impact?  
**[0:46:21-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:21):**  Step one here is, and it's kind of parallel steps, if you will.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:24):**  We have to study the people that are doing it right now.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:27):**  Which is interesting.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:28):**  You go from a linear here to a loop as well.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:30):**  They're parallel steps.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:31):**  It's not step one, two, three, four.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:33):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:34):**  We do our best to study the people that are doing amazing things now and compare them  
**[0:46:38-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:38):**  against other people that are trying their best to do things.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:41):**  Then we try to draw out differences.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:44):**  So in this McDonald's funded study, we've studied five sets of ranches in the Southeast  
**[0:46:50-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:50):**  United States.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:52):**  We're documenting changes in everything from soil carbon to water infiltration to microbial  
**[0:46:58-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:46:58):**  genetics to plant species to insects and bugs and even rancher well-being happiness, like  
**[0:47:04-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:04):**  you were describing earlier and trying to draw that out.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:07):**  We're just aggregating that data now and be publishing hopefully sometime this year with  
**[0:47:12-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:12):**  the first pieces.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:13):**  That would be amazing.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:14):**  But we have to realize that even if 10 other people join us in doing similar research,  
**[0:47:19-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:19):**  those things will always follow, not lead, the regenerative practices because the only  
**[0:47:25-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:25):**  way to get regeneration is to work at the system level.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:28):**  So meanwhile, what I can tell you is anecdotally, even though I don't have the quantitative  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:32):**  data, very early on in my journey, I set foot on so many regenerative ranches.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:37):**  And frankly, I still remember the time I took my wife out in the field on one of these regenerative  
**[0:47:42-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:42):**  producers, Greg Judy in Missouri.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:45):**  And she says, oh my God, there's like insects everywhere, butterflies, dragonflies.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:49):**  And the first thing you actually see is as a human being, you notice because very few  
**[0:47:54-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:54):**  of us are soil scientists, is that, wow, life is thriving in this place.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:47:58):**  And so in that way, I think it's a legitimate hook for us as-  
**[0:48:02-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:02):**  Which mean life, insects, which means birds by definition.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:05):**  Yeah, insects and birds.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:06):**  So birds feed on insects, birds feed in habitat.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:09):**  All this life is connected in its loops, right?  
**[0:48:12-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:12):**  Birds can fly away, they don't need to be there.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:14):**  In a sense, they're-  
**[0:48:15-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:15):**  I like to see birds float with their wings.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:17):**  Yeah, we did.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:18):**  I'm going to make the canary in the coal mine, I think is a great point here.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:22):**  They will go if the insects are not there.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:25):**  Some people say the metal arc is the canary of the prairie, as a cliche.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:29):**  I didn't invent that, but I think that's true.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:31):**  And it ties back to that 50% loss of grassland birds in the last 50 years.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:35):**  So I think the one thing we can say definitively, and kind of strangely enough in this McDonald's  
**[0:48:40-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:40):**  Fund research project, it was a little bit of an add on at the end.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:45):**  One of my dear friends, Steve Appelbaum at Applied Ecological Services, their team did  
**[0:48:49-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:49):**  a lot of the on the ground work here, but they did bird count data on the same five  
**[0:48:54-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:54):**  companion ranches.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:48:55):**  And it's the grassland bird species on these ranches is the most different thing of anything  
**[0:49:00-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:00):**  we measured.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:01):**  So the birds really are voting with their wings to tell us that, hey, I like this one  
**[0:49:05-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:05):**  better than that one.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:07):**  It's true in terms of population and it's true in terms of species diversity.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:11):**  And what's really valuable here, we like to say birds are the treasure and the measure.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:15):**  For Audubon, they're a legitimate conservation goal.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:18):**  But they're also a legitimate biological sensor that votes with its wings to go around and  
**[0:49:24-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:24):**  say this place is better than that one.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:27):**  And so I think we can use wildlife as a leading indicator of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:33):**  And then it has a double benefit, of course.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:35):**  It's a much easier story to engage consumers around birds and butterflies.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:40):**  And those are things that are just much easier to talk to ordinary everyday folk about than  
**[0:49:46-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:46):**  a ton of carbon.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:47):**  More birds is better.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:48):**  I mean, more butterflies is probably better.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:49):**  You know, mommy, I like the pretty birds, right?  
**[0:49:52-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:52):**  It's just an easy it's an easier thing.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:55):**  And again, I think we're talking about a civilizational scale journey.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:49:58):**  If we're going to unwind the bad things we unintentionally did from 10,000 years of history,  
**[0:50:04-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:04):**  we're not going to snap our fingers and do it overnight.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:07):**  Any given farm can do it real quickly.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:09):**  This kind of five to 10 year window, it's really quickly.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:10):**  But if we're going to rebuild a system, it's going to take generations.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:14):**  And so I think we don't have to like, throw messages out to consumers that create a really  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:20):**  long leap for them to try to understand and engage in a different food system.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:24):**  If we can start with simple stories like this food is good for birds and butterflies and  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:29):**  wildlife and you and you it's healthy for you delivering a nourishing food for you.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:34):**  But if we can kind of start there and then over the course of years and decades have  
**[0:50:39-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:39):**  a conversation about carbon and water and prosperity and it's just a lot of benefits  
**[0:50:45-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:45):**  of letting nature write the checks, right?  
**[0:50:47-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:47):**  Gladly write the checks, which I think is what's really going on.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:51):**  I completely agree.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:52):**  I think it's this is a long game, but we have to start now because we're entrepreneurial,  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:50:56):**  meaning you need to pay, you need to keep the lights going and get more farmers on the  
**[0:51:01-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:01):**  journey.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:02):**  The clock's ticking.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:03):**  And Interstellar as a movie is not far off the mark.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:07):**  I mean, we're, again, I went to school and you're running out of Iowa.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:10):**  We're running out of Iowa.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:12):**  And the climate is telling us that something is broken and it takes time to do this at  
**[0:51:19-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:19):**  the scale we're doing it.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:20):**  Even now in the age of COVID, a lot of people are disappointed to see that the Keeling curve  
**[0:51:26-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:26):**  hasn't turned around and gone back down just because we turned off all the power plants  
**[0:51:29-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:29):**  and cars for a couple of months.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:32):**  But I would invite people to go into that Keeling curve.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:34):**  This is the curve that measures atmospheric CO2 that you see frequently.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:38):**  The year to year increase is what happens as a result of industrial civilization.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:43):**  But if you look at the curve, the intra-annual variations, the up and down, this is nature  
**[0:51:49-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:49):**  inhaling and exhaling.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:50):**  It's breathing.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:51):**  It's doing what I was describing at the planetary level.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:54):**  And it's about 10 times bigger than the annual increase.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:51:56):**  And so the task we have in front of us here is to manage Earth in a way that gets that  
**[0:52:01-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:01):**  inhale to be bigger than the exhale.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:04):**  And once we can do that, we can start turning the atmospheric CO2 curve back in the other  
**[0:52:08-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:08):**  direction.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:09):**  And there'll be a whole bunch of other things that go with it.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:11):**  Water systems will flow better, birds will come back, humans will be healthier.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:15):**  So there's a lot of co-benefits in that system.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:17):**  But that clock is ticking out there.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:20):**  Is it safe to say that Earth has a respiratory disease?  
**[0:52:22-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:23):**  Or at least an issue?  
**[0:52:24-0:52:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:25):**  I like it.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:26):**  Can I use it?  
**[0:52:27-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:27):**  It's great.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:28):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:29):**  Of course.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:30):**  It's not the first.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:31):**  It's for sure not the first.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:32):**  But it is.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:33):**  I mean, you described that we always look at, OK, it's now May or it's June 2020.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:37):**  If we look at a year ago, we were at 416 parts per million, et cetera.  
**[0:52:41-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:41):**  But we always forget there's this huge shift over the year and over the day, even over  
**[0:52:45-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:45):**  the place, even in terms of literally breathing.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:49):**  Where does it come from?  
**[0:52:50-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:50):**  From everything that grows on Earth.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:52):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:53):**  Thus, by definition, we need more stuff growing on Earth as soon as possible.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:52:57):**  And much of it, because that's the breathing or the cough, basically.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:01):**  That's the issue we're in, plus we're burning it, obviously.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:03):**  But there's a much bigger curve happening there.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:06):**  And most people focus on that little difference, which is a huge issue.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:11):**  But the breathing is the piece that we can actually change very quickly.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:15):**  For what it's worth, just so people know it, all the scientists do, but a few of the lay  
**[0:53:19-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:19):**  people do.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:20):**  If we could somehow shut off all of the emissions today, we would still be getting warmer.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:26):**  So we have to take out of the air some of the CO2 that we've put there, or we're still  
**[0:53:32-0:53:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:32):**  in trouble.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:33):**  So we absolutely need to eliminate the emissions as rapidly and significantly as possible.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:39):**  But it's not enough.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:40):**  We really have to find ways to reverse the carbon cycle.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:44):**  And I think nature is our biggest tool to do that.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:47):**  Yeah, we can invent physical industrial machinery to do that, some.  
**[0:53:52-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:52):**  But back to the story of grassland and what it's doing, all we got to do is manage grasslands  
**[0:53:57-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:53:57):**  and forests and savannas differently.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:00):**  And we can help push that needle back in the right direction.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:02):**  Because that's a question of scale, I get off on as well, because you get very different  
**[0:54:06-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:06):**  reports there and potentially you get some groups, the report comes out, okay, if we  
**[0:54:10-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:10):**  change agriculture just in a few places, we store enough for XYZ and some others, like  
**[0:54:15-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:15):**  even if we change all the agriculture in the world, it will never be enough.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:18):**  Like there's very mixed messages coming out there in terms of potential for carbon storage.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:24):**  What is your take on that?  
**[0:54:25-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:25):**  Yeah, I was humbled and honored to be a co-author on a paper with some really smart scientists.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:33):**  Steve who I mentioned, Steve Appelbaum, who I mentioned earlier, Ratan Lal and others,  
**[0:54:36-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:36):**  where we tried to put some numbers on that for North America.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:39):**  It was published in the Journal of Soil and Water Conservation in 2016.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:44):**  And what we tried to do is weave a story of regenerative agriculture applied to not only  
**[0:54:48-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:48):**  the livestock and grazing systems, but crop production systems.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:52):**  And in doing that, we were able to demonstrate that at least in terms of potential, right,  
**[0:54:59-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:54:59):**  again, it's really hard to say in terms of potential that we could really put a major  
**[0:55:03-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:03):**  dent in this kind of overall climate equation, sequestering over a billion tons a year in  
**[0:55:09-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:09):**  North America on an ongoing basis.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:12):**  So it's still really early, there's really wide uncertainties around that.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:16):**  And it's why I'm so supportive of step one is get more farmers doing it.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:21):**  Step two is measure it.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:22):**  Step three is engage consumers in that story to create pull for step one and step two.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:26):**  Because there's a lot of uncertainty in terms of where the plateaus, how deep do we store  
**[0:55:32-0:55:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:32):**  it.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:33):**  And I think a lot of these headlines come out of that, like regenerative agriculture  
**[0:55:37-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:37):**  is never going to do enough or regenerative agriculture is going to do everything.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:40):**  And it's a constant like a swing between.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:43):**  And I think, I mean, there's an argument there, obviously, on the carbon, I think the story  
**[0:55:47-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:47):**  is much bigger than carbon, which we've touched upon in this piece.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:50):**  It's about water cycles, it's about regeneration of life in general, even without the carbon  
**[0:55:55-0:56:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:55:55):**  piece, even if we wouldn't be severely suffering of climate change, we still would like to  
**[0:56:00-0:56:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:00):**  change the agriculture and land use sector completely, because of all the other benefits,  
**[0:56:05-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:05):**  even just on taste, there would be enough to do this.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:08):**  But probably we're going to figure out at least my imagination is my, we're going to  
**[0:56:12-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:12):**  figure out a lot of extra benefits, even in terms of local climate stabilization of increased  
**[0:56:18-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:18):**  rainfalls in places where we want to decrease in places where we don't want or softer rainfall.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:23):**  I mean, there's going to be so many things we're going to figure out over the next decades,  
**[0:56:28-0:56:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:28):**  that the focus on just okay, can we store enough carbon quick enough in the top 20 centimeters?  
**[0:56:33-0:56:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:33):**  It's an important piece, but it's only one piece of a much bigger puzzle.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:36):**  But it's what all the papers are focusing on, or at least all the online statements.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:40):**  They do.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:42):**  As someone who's spent a long time investing in heretical ideas in energy technology, I'm  
**[0:56:49-0:56:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:49):**  used to working with bleeding edge science.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:52):**  This is bleeding edge.  
**[0:56:53-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:53):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:54):**  I love it.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:55):**  It's so bleeding.  
**[0:56:56-0:56:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:56):**  I get more excited every day, because there's so much to learn.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:56:59):**  Nature blows my mind.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:01):**  But they over-constrained something, because we're really smart at something.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:04):**  Even things like the top 20 centimeters of soil that you just described.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:08):**  It was obvious to me very early on, perhaps because I stepped in from the side, that our  
**[0:57:12-0:57:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:12):**  whole mental model for how soil carbon accumulates is just incomplete, is the way to think of  
**[0:57:17-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:17):**  it.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:18):**  Without realizing it, we were calculating carbon as if we were filling a bathtub with  
**[0:57:23-0:57:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:23):**  something.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:24):**  There's a fixed volume, and we're going to fill up the little holes between the grains  
**[0:57:27-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:27):**  and the soil, and then it's going to be full, and it's done.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:31):**  In reality, what's going on is it's a part of a biological dynamic system, where the  
**[0:57:36-0:57:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:36):**  system is evolving and churning, and you're actually growing the bathtub.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:40):**  The soil is growing upwards in time.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:44):**  I know there'll be people on this that listen to this and think that's heretical, but I  
**[0:57:48-0:57:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:48):**  would say Archimedes himself would recognize that it's just first principles of physics.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:52):**  There's no novelty in that.  
**[0:57:55-0:58:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:57:55):**  Every soil scientist in the world knows that as you increase soil organic matter, the soil  
**[0:58:00-0:58:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:00):**  gets less dense, and that's because effectively you're fluffing it up, and you're filling  
**[0:58:05-0:58:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:05):**  up some of the fluff that you've created with organic matter, but still it's overall fluffed  
**[0:58:09-0:58:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:09):**  up.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:10):**  It's kind of funny as an old oil and gas guy, because everything I thought I knew about  
**[0:58:15-0:58:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:15):**  how carbon worked in sediment, if I just flip it around the other way, like hold it up to  
**[0:58:19-0:58:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:19):**  a mirror, I get regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:22):**  In that world, we would extract carbon from a reservoir, it would deplete, and it would  
**[0:58:27-0:58:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:27):**  compact.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:28):**  In regenerative agriculture, we pump it back in, and it inflates and gets larger.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:32):**  It sort of makes sense, because a lot of the topsoil we lost is both floating away and  
**[0:58:38-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:38):**  actually carbon that went up in the air.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:40):**  This sort of compaction, and a lot of it is unannounced.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:44):**  Don't email me when you're a soil scientist, please.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:47):**  From a conceptual perspective, it makes sense.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:48):**  We lost a lot of topsoil.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:49):**  You see that in Iowa.  
**[0:58:50-0:58:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:50):**  You see these horrible pictures of how much topsoil we lost, which floated away in many  
**[0:58:55-0:59:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:58:55):**  cases, but in many cases also was gas and basically was the fluffiness that left the  
**[0:59:01-0:59:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:01):**  soil and went up in the air, which is why we're partly in this mess.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:04):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:05):**  Super interesting.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:06):**  I mean, we can spend hours and hours on this.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:09):**  I want to touch upon a few more pieces.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:11):**  First of all, actually, we didn't really answer the question.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:14):**  In eight to 10 years, you said on an individual level of farms, you can get to cheaper than  
**[0:59:18-0:59:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:18):**  a CAFO, but then on aggregated, it takes longer because of what you're building, because of  
**[0:59:24-0:59:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:24):**  the butcher side, because of the consumer side, because of the transport.  
**[0:59:29-0:59:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:29):**  All of that costs more when you're very small.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:31):**  Is that fair to say?  
**[0:59:33-0:59:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:33):**  Well, the market has to grow, right?  
**[0:59:35-0:59:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:35):**  So Tesla's been making amazing cars for 10 years now or more, but they're now becoming  
**[0:59:41-0:59:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:41):**  the best-selling cars, right?  
**[0:59:43-0:59:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:43):**  So you've got this big fleet displacement problem in food, just like you do in transport.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:48):**  It's a bit faster, maybe.  
**[0:59:50-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:51):**  It'll take time.  
**[0:59:52-0:59:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:52):**  And even in the farming community, I think there'll be innovative business models.  
**[0:59:56-1:00:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=0:59:56):**  Some producers themselves will honestly, like in my segment here with livestock production,  
**[1:00:02-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:02):**  it doesn't take much more labor to move 500 head than 50 or even 5,000 than 500 in a day.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:09):**  So there are some economies of scale on the production side, but they're also in processing.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:14):**  There's a lot of energy now on small local processors, which is great.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:17):**  This company Lawrence Meats that I mentioned that processes our food is more power-leg  
**[1:00:21-1:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:21):**  than below.  
**[1:00:22-1:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:22):**  Yeah.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:23):**  They're not as big as a CAFO, a large processing plant, but they're way bigger than your town  
**[1:00:27-1:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:27):**  blockers.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:28):**  They kind of are optimized to be able to flow through a fairly moderate amount of animals  
**[1:00:33-1:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:33):**  in a day.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:34):**  And so it works.  
**[1:00:35-1:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:35):**  And so I think new business models emerge, even on the farm side.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:38):**  It may not be like the land has to be held by the same person, but maybe new business  
**[1:00:43-1:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:43):**  models where many farmers join their herds together and manage thousands of acres as  
**[1:00:47-1:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:47):**  a community.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:48):**  That's how we used to do it in the commons.  
**[1:00:51-1:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:51):**  I think you'll see the reemergence of some of this stuff and people are moving a lot  
**[1:00:55-1:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:55):**  of the fencing.  
**[1:00:56-1:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:56):**  Yeah.  
**[1:00:57-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:00:57):**  I think that's, so I think it'll get, it'll get interesting.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:00):**  And you know, the type, there's a size thing there, right?  
**[1:01:02-1:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:02):**  The bigger herd, the bigger impact, not just because they're more, but they, there is a  
**[1:01:05-1:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:05):**  network effect there.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:07):**  Right?  
**[1:01:08-1:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:08):**  Well, the way, maybe the way to think of it is at least here in North America, the stories  
**[1:01:11-1:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:11):**  are of bison herds that would take days to pass a river.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:15):**  Right?  
**[1:01:16-1:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:16):**  And so again, if nature has her choice to do things, she does figure out how to do economies  
**[1:01:21-1:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:21):**  of scale in systems that works for the benefit of both the ecosystem and the animal.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:26):**  And so I think we'll see new types of scale.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:30):**  They just, there'll be loops of scale instead of lines of scale, if you can make that.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:34):**  And our, our business here with this Blue Nest beef and delivering food to customers  
**[1:01:38-1:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:38):**  is a way to tap into other people that have already scaled other things like fulfillment  
**[1:01:44-1:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:44):**  and distribution.  
**[1:01:45-1:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:45):**  Right?  
**[1:01:46-1:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:46):**  And you can ship things frozen to your doorstep by FedEx and UPS that I couldn't do even 10  
**[1:01:51-1:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:51):**  years ago.  
**[1:01:52-1:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:52):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:53-1:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:53):**  Because let's talk about it.  
**[1:01:54-1:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:54):**  You launched in November last year.  
**[1:01:56-1:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:01:56):**  I mean, timing pretty good, but I think the last few months have been interesting.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:00):**  Can you describe briefly what has happened at Blue Nest beef?  
**[1:02:04-1:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:04):**  Well, certainly I wish we would have launched a year earlier cause we would have had all  
**[1:02:07-1:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:07):**  the kinks worked out before COVID hit.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:09):**  But yeah, all of a sudden in, in March and April of this year, consumers started to care  
**[1:02:14-1:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:14):**  a little bit about where their food was going to come from, but not from a sustainability  
**[1:02:17-1:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:17):**  perspective more from a, just like, where am I going to get my food perspective?  
**[1:02:21-1:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:21):**  So the rush to online groceries in general was large and the rushed online meat sales  
**[1:02:30-1:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:30):**  was even larger.  
**[1:02:32-1:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:32):**  And it's because people had always kind of held back on fresh and frozen food products  
**[1:02:38-1:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:38):**  and they were very comfortable with getting a box of something delivered to their doorstep.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:42):**  Clothes mostly.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:43):**  But food, it was always a bit tricky.  
**[1:02:45-1:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:45):**  It was always a bit tricky.  
**[1:02:46-1:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:46):**  Of course, online grocery was one of the first internet crazes and they all cratered, right?  
**[1:02:50-1:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:50):**  Cause they couldn't figure out how to make it all work economically.  
**[1:02:53-1:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:53):**  And that's what I mean by, you know, now with FedEx and UPS, I mean, you can, whether you're  
**[1:02:56-1:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:02:56):**  ordering seafood or meat or whatever, you can get just about anything delivered to your  
**[1:03:01-1:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:01):**  doorstep along with the razor blades if you want it, right?  
**[1:03:03-1:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:03):**  I mean, it's a very liquid, flexible system because the Amazons of the world and the many  
**[1:03:08-1:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:08):**  other entrepreneurs have evolved that business.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:12):**  So indeed the current crisis has been a surge to our business.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:18):**  It has its own challenges.  
**[1:03:19-1:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:19):**  Our messaging, you know, we'd really like to talk about birds and carbon and some of  
**[1:03:22-1:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:22):**  these bigger things.  
**[1:03:24-1:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:24):**  And a lot of our messaging is like, Hey, we still got inventory.  
**[1:03:26-1:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:26):**  We can chip you something that'll be there.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:29):**  So we're still learning as well, but I'm quite encouraged to see that it may more broadly  
**[1:03:35-1:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:35):**  than just us and BlueNest beef is all across America at least.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:38):**  And I would expect in other places as well, the many farmers who are figuring out how  
**[1:03:44-1:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:44):**  to sell to their local communities have experienced the same rush, right?  
**[1:03:48-1:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:48):**  Which is if you had food for sale, people came to your doorstep and figured out how  
**[1:03:53-1:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:53):**  to get it to their kitchens.  
**[1:03:55-1:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:03:55):**  And so, you know, even aside from the food, what that means to me is that there are thousands  
**[1:04:00-1:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:00):**  and hundreds of thousands of Americans who are now getting to know a farmer somewhere  
**[1:04:05-1:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:05):**  and getting to know something about where their food came from and how it was produced,  
**[1:04:10-1:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:10):**  who produced it, what it did.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:13):**  And I hope some of that sticks.  
**[1:04:14-1:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:14):**  I realize at some point they'll get the convenience of just being able to go to the grocery store  
**[1:04:19-1:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:19):**  and get it.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:20):**  Yeah, but some of it, I think we don't know if it's going to be 50% of this growth or  
**[1:04:24-1:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:24):**  10 or two, but it's not going to be zero.  
**[1:04:26-1:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:26):**  I mean, not everybody switches back, especially on taste and especially on convenience.  
**[1:04:31-1:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:31):**  I mean, it gets to your doorstep.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:33):**  I mean, how convenient do you want to have it?  
**[1:04:35-1:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:35):**  And that's probably, yeah, we don't know that number.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:38):**  Maybe in a year we know more or less what has been sticking and have that been enough  
**[1:04:42-1:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:42):**  to grow a lot of these businesses, a lot of these farms.  
**[1:04:45-1:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:45):**  And that's exactly right.  
**[1:04:46-1:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:46):**  Taste and convenience are where we're putting our bets.  
**[1:04:48-1:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:48):**  You know, we think if you taste our food and you find it as compelling as we think you  
**[1:04:53-1:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:53):**  will that you're much more likely to stick with it when you go back and get that, especially  
**[1:04:58-1:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:04:58):**  at a grocery store or hamburger and take a taste and go, then you end up having to use  
**[1:05:03-1:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:03):**  more ketchup, I guess.  
**[1:05:04-1:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:04):**  You can always cover it in sauce.  
**[1:05:05-1:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:05):**  Yeah, that's the-  
**[1:05:06-1:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:06):**  You can always cover it with something.  
**[1:05:08-1:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:08):**  But I think once people, once their bodies recognize real food, and again, it's really  
**[1:05:12-1:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:12):**  hard to know how many stick with it, but I'm pretty confident that many will as well.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:18):**  And then of course our challenge as the entrepreneurs is to ensure that we can continue to deliver  
**[1:05:23-1:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:23):**  that.  
**[1:05:24-1:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:24):**  But I mean, everything is hard to predict.  
**[1:05:26-1:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:26):**  I feel, I tell people that, you know, in the age of COVID here, I feel like I'm in a wormhole  
**[1:05:30-1:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:30):**  and I don't know what the universe is going to look like when we pop out the other side,  
**[1:05:34-1:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:34):**  but I know it's not exactly this.  
**[1:05:36-1:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:36):**  I think we're in a temporary transitional state of some kind.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:40):**  Now, I think the principles of physics that support-  
**[1:05:45-1:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:45):**  Are still going to apply.  
**[1:05:46-1:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:46):**  Are still going to apply, right?  
**[1:05:48-1:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:48):**  I believe that there's some really, really deep physics and science behind this, you  
**[1:05:52-1:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:52):**  know, what nature wants, what the ecosystem wants to happen, that will continue to drive  
**[1:05:57-1:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:05:57):**  things in a favorable direction.  
**[1:06:00-1:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:00):**  But exactly how that plays out and, you know, whether our particular business model is,  
**[1:06:04-1:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:04):**  you know, welcome and central, those are still uncertainties.  
**[1:06:09-1:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:09):**  And let's wrap up with a few questions.  
**[1:06:12-1:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:12):**  One let's very briefly, which is super dangerous because this is never going to be briefly,  
**[1:06:16-1:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:16):**  talk about methane.  
**[1:06:17-1:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:17):**  Again, I will link your TEDx talk, but for people that say, okay, but okay, we talked  
**[1:06:21-1:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:21):**  about carbon, but what about, let's assume with all the research that's coming and actually  
**[1:06:25-1:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:25):**  some of the research that has been done that the carbon footprint of beef can be positive  
**[1:06:30-1:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:30):**  when done well.  
**[1:06:31-1:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:31):**  I think, I think it can, you think it can, but we still need a lot of research there,  
**[1:06:36-1:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:36):**  which has been going on.  
**[1:06:37-1:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:37):**  I mean, there's a lot there, but what about this methane, which seems to be like the second  
**[1:06:42-1:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:42):**  argument everybody uses immediately.  
**[1:06:44-1:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:44):**  Yeah, but they fart a lot, which is not true.  
**[1:06:46-1:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:46):**  But what's the short answer?  
**[1:06:48-1:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:48):**  I'm asking an impossible thing, but the short answer on when somebody says, let's say, you  
**[1:06:51-1:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:51):**  say a potential client calls you and said, yeah, but Russ, what about the methane?  
**[1:06:55-1:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:55):**  So the shortest possible answer is that the carbon we store in the soil significantly  
**[1:06:59-1:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:06:59):**  more than offsets the potential methane emissions.  
**[1:07:03-1:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:03):**  A little bit of insight probably helps that the talk that you're referring to is I gave  
**[1:07:08-1:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:08):**  it the Grass-fed exchange in 2017.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:11):**  It's a few years ago.  
**[1:07:12-1:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:12):**  Yeah.  
**[1:07:13-1:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:13):**  So there's, I think a lot more.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:14):**  Yeah, but it's still mostly relevant.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:16):**  And because of where I am and the people I know, I had early look at things that have  
**[1:07:21-1:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:21):**  only since become public.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:23):**  And I give some clues in that conversation.  
**[1:07:26-1:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:26):**  But the way to maybe help people understand this is methane is nothing more than incompletely  
**[1:07:30-1:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:30):**  combusted hydrocarbon.  
**[1:07:32-1:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:32):**  You can hear an X-Tel person talking.  
**[1:07:34-1:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:34):**  Yeah, that's amazing.  
**[1:07:35-1:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:35):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:36):**  Think of it like the leaky gas from your exhaust pipe of your car that wasn't quite combusted  
**[1:07:41-1:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:41):**  in the engine.  
**[1:07:43-1:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:43):**  So it's a symptom of an engine that isn't perfectly tuned yet to combust it all the  
**[1:07:48-1:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:48):**  way into CO2.  
**[1:07:49-1:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:49):**  Are you saying that if a cow burps, it means that a cow hasn't digested everything, meaning  
**[1:07:55-1:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:07:55):**  that if a cow is feeding on the super diverse perennial grass, as you're mentioning, she  
**[1:08:02-1:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:02):**  is burping a lot less?  
**[1:08:03-1:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:03):**  You're a clever guy.  
**[1:08:04-1:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:04):**  I saw the video, but yeah.  
**[1:08:08-1:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:08):**  It's a situation in which...  
**[1:08:10-1:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:10):**  It's interesting, which means that if we study that, which probably a lot of this research  
**[1:08:15-1:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:15):**  hasn't been done, but if we study very healthy soil grass systems with ruminants, we would  
**[1:08:21-1:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:21):**  like to know the difference in burping of ruminants that are in those systems and ruminants  
**[1:08:26-1:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:26):**  that are in CAFOs.  
**[1:08:28-1:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:28):**  Correct.  
**[1:08:29-1:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:29):**  And I think that that's an area that there's some clues.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:32):**  It still needs more research.  
**[1:08:34-1:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:34):**  But once you understand the fundamental principles involved, it kind of makes sense.  
**[1:08:38-1:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:38):**  So first of all, anytime a cow is like an internal combustion car, it is a combustion  
**[1:08:43-1:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:43):**  engine.  
**[1:08:45-1:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:45):**  Most of that combustion is biological metabolic stuff rather than high temperature engines.  
**[1:08:52-1:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:52):**  And so as long as there's a combustion car, it will have a tailpipe and there will be  
**[1:08:56-1:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:56):**  exhaust.  
**[1:08:57-1:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:57):**  So you can't eliminate methane completely.  
**[1:08:59-1:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:08:59):**  However, what we can say is when the diet is diverse and has everything it needs to  
**[1:09:07-1:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:09:07):**  get as much energy out of the fuel as it can, there will be less methane that comes out.  
**[1:09:14-1:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:09:14):**  So you're seeing a wide proliferation of ideas of additives for...  
**[1:09:18-1:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:09:18):**  Seaweeds.  
**[1:09:19-1:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:09:19):**  I've seen many, many.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:09:21):**  What those things did, think of them like gasoline additives for your car.  
**[1:09:24-1:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:09:24):**  They help the engine perform more perfectly to shift more of that energy towards the favorable  
**[1:09:29-1:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:09:29):**  things that the animal's metabolism is trying to achieve.  
**[1:09:33-1:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:09:33):**  What we can see, so in one of the famous papers that addresses this question directly by Paige  
**[1:09:38-1:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:09:38):**  Stanley at Michigan State University with Dr. Jason Roundtree, they actually did some  
**[1:09:45-1:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:09:45):**  measurements of methane and pasture of the animals and they found that they were actually  
**[1:09:49-1:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:09:49):**  30% lower than what the standard IPCC standards would expect.  
**[1:09:56-1:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:09:56):**  Now they did all of their calculations with the IPCC standards because that's what you  
**[1:10:01-1:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:10:01):**  need to do for calibration, but I think it was noteworthy that they saw this about a  
**[1:10:07-1:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:10:07):**  30% reduction, which I would attribute to a diverse, healthy forage from healthy soil.  
**[1:10:14-1:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:10:14):**  Jason is involved in this McDonald's project that I mentioned earlier.  
**[1:10:17-1:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:10:17):**  We've got a similar system where we do methane measurements of animal feeds at feeding trough,  
**[1:10:25-1:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:10:25):**  like do some temporary things.  
**[1:10:26-1:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:10:26):**  They come in and they chew and they burp and then you measure how much methane is in  
**[1:10:29-1:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:10:29):**  there and we're finding a fairly similar number there as well.  
**[1:10:34-1:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:10:34):**  So I think we're seeing that directionally things are moving favorably in these diverse  
**[1:10:39-1:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:10:39):**  pastures.  
**[1:10:41-1:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:10:41):**  Exactly how far, how fast, how big, I don't know, but what we can say is at least the  
**[1:10:46-1:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:10:46):**  potential and we just don't have enough places mapped out with all the variables, like I  
**[1:10:52-1:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:10:52):**  said, much to the chagrin of a conventional scientific mind, but kind of is what it is,  
**[1:10:57-1:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:10:57):**  but we can certainly document more and more places now where the net uptake of carbon  
**[1:11:02-1:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:02):**  in the soil is more than the effective climate contribution of the methane that's being emitted.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:08):**  It's not a perfect answer, but it's a good start.  
**[1:11:11-1:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:11):**  Yeah, if you want to understand the methane question, you've got to look at a slightly  
**[1:11:14-1:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:14):**  bigger picture and understand this relationship of soil and animal and grass and all of the  
**[1:11:20-1:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:20):**  above.  
**[1:11:21-1:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:21):**  I'm shifting gears now.  
**[1:11:22-1:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:22):**  But if you would be, let's say tomorrow morning or today, be in charge of a $1 billion investment  
**[1:11:28-1:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:28):**  portfolio, what would you invest it in?  
**[1:11:31-1:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:31):**  How would you put it to work?  
**[1:11:32-1:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:32):**  It's a great question.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:33):**  I've heard you ask something like that before.  
**[1:11:36-1:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:36):**  So I kind of thought cheated and thought a little bit ahead of time.  
**[1:11:40-1:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:40):**  I think I would probably invest about 20% of that in just really good science, observational  
**[1:11:45-1:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:45):**  science, very much like I talked about, because I think the more we understand, the more we're  
**[1:11:49-1:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:49):**  going to understand what we need to do.  
**[1:11:52-1:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:52):**  What would be the single piece, like if you had to select one, okay, this is reductionist  
**[1:11:56-1:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:11:56):**  thinking, but what would you love that a group of scientists focused on now, tomorrow, yesterday?  
**[1:12:03-1:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:03):**  Well, it is reductionist thinking.  
**[1:12:05-1:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:05):**  It's thinking at that system level, right?  
**[1:12:08-1:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:08):**  The unique thing in this McDonald's research is that we did work at a system level compared  
**[1:12:11-1:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:11):**  to at least any other science.  
**[1:12:13-1:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:13):**  So we need to understand the relationship of the animal to the grass, to the soil, to  
**[1:12:17-1:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:17):**  the sunshine, to the water.  
**[1:12:19-1:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:19):**  And so I would, by definition, only allocate that 20% to that kind of system level science.  
**[1:12:26-1:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:26):**  Everybody else can continue on with the focused reductionist science.  
**[1:12:31-1:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:31):**  I think from that science, you're going to have some new technologies emerge that allow  
**[1:12:35-1:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:35):**  us to measure, track, model, perhaps coax and cajole that regenerative ecosystem that  
**[1:12:41-1:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:41):**  might fit in the classic investment portfolio of a venture capital type thing.  
**[1:12:46-1:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:46):**  Some risky tech.  
**[1:12:47-1:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:47):**  Yeah, I can see that.  
**[1:12:48-1:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:48):**  I can see that kind of risky tech type stuff.  
**[1:12:50-1:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:50):**  But I would say the 60% of the majority of that investment I would direct towards actual  
**[1:12:54-1:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:54):**  implementation of novel business models, which I've talked about so far.  
**[1:12:59-1:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:12:59):**  Getting the regenerative products, produce products from the farm to consume.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:04):**  Yeah, they'll be tech involved.  
**[1:13:05-1:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:05):**  So heavy information technology and measurement technology and stuff like that.  
**[1:13:09-1:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:09):**  But I think the entrepreneurs are going to make regenerative agriculture happen are the  
**[1:13:14-1:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:14):**  ones that invent new business models that help scale regenerative agriculture.  
**[1:13:20-1:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:20):**  The principles may be controversial to scientists, but they're not controversial to practitioners.  
**[1:13:25-1:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:25):**  They work each and every time in the field.  
**[1:13:28-1:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:28):**  What we have to do is figure out how to build market mechanisms.  
**[1:13:31-1:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:31):**  But yet Alan Savory gets an enormous amount of pushback that it's never been proven on  
**[1:13:35-1:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:35):**  scale, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[1:13:37-1:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:37):**  If you read the comments on the TED talk or in some of the discussions in the UK, it's  
**[1:13:43-1:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:43):**  really interesting.  
**[1:13:46-1:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:46):**  I always wonder when is the last time you talked to regenerative ranchers that would  
**[1:13:50-1:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:50):**  tell you it actually does work.  
**[1:13:52-1:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:52):**  And here you can see it.  
**[1:13:53-1:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:53):**  But there's this, I don't know, this cloud of misinformation or talk around it.  
**[1:13:58-1:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:13:58):**  Yeah, I'm used to that from the world I came from too in energy technology.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:02):**  It's no different.  
**[1:14:03-1:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:03):**  Solar will never get beyond 100% and things like that.  
**[1:14:06-1:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:06):**  Everybody's always careful.  
**[1:14:07-1:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:07):**  Copernicus, of course, the famous stories, right?  
**[1:14:10-1:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:10):**  Pretty darned up.  
**[1:14:11-1:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:11):**  That's true.  
**[1:14:12-1:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:12):**  Okay, now you're...  
**[1:14:14-1:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:14):**  We human beings are not really quick to jump onto things.  
**[1:14:16-1:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:16):**  I'm a big fan of Thomas Kuhn, wrote a book called The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:20):**  He coined this phrase paradigm.  
**[1:14:23-1:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:23):**  I always tell people that a paradigm is the most difficult thing to break.  
**[1:14:27-1:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:27):**  So this thing of thinking in loops instead of lines is a paradigm shift.  
**[1:14:31-1:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:31):**  This thinking of killing, not emerging instead of killing is a paradigm shift.  
**[1:14:35-1:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:35):**  Yeah, you just have to fundamentally look at things differently.  
**[1:14:38-1:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:38):**  And what Kuhn taught us in his study of all these scientific revolutions throughout history,  
**[1:14:42-1:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:42):**  he was a professor of the history of technology at MIT, was normal science tries to squeeze  
**[1:14:48-1:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:48):**  everything into conventional explanations up until the moment when it can no longer  
**[1:14:53-1:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:53):**  fit.  
**[1:14:54-1:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:54):**  And then bursts.  
**[1:14:55-1:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:55):**  That only happens when you get enough data that just cannot be ignored.  
**[1:14:59-1:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:14:59):**  Yeah, I just finished the book 1491 on how the landscapes looked and how the indigenous  
**[1:15:06-1:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:15:06):**  peoples managed landscapes and how long a lot of these things have stopped.  
**[1:15:11-1:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:15:11):**  How much science was already there for 20, 30 years until people said, no, actually,  
**[1:15:15-1:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:15:15):**  there were a lot more people living, peoples living all across before Columbus came.  
**[1:15:19-1:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:15:19):**  And actually, there were a million other things that we never thought were there would actually  
**[1:15:22-1:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:15:22):**  happen.  
**[1:15:23-1:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:15:23):**  But sometimes you see a lifetime of a scientist that has been publishing and complaining,  
**[1:15:29-1:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:15:29):**  like, look, it was completely different.  
**[1:15:30-1:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:15:30):**  They managed with fire on a huge scale and they did this and it took until after he or  
**[1:15:35-1:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:15:35):**  she was dead before the whole thing unraveled.  
**[1:15:37-1:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:15:37):**  But yeah, the heretics, you know, there's famous examples in the modern time are the  
**[1:15:43-1:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:15:43):**  people that invented the concept of plate tectonics.  
**[1:15:46-1:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:15:46):**  The idea that the asteroids killed the dinosaurs, the fact that ulcers are caused by microbes.  
**[1:15:51-1:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:15:51):**  These are all heretical ideas that were by early traditional scientists.  
**[1:15:57-1:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:15:57):**  But all the more reason why the data, what Kuhn taught us in that book was that the crisis  
**[1:16:01-1:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:01):**  that allows the new paradigm to emerge only emerges when the data becomes so compelling  
**[1:16:07-1:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:07):**  that it can no longer be ignored in any way.  
**[1:16:11-1:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:11):**  And so this is why I think it's so important that farmers and business people around the  
**[1:16:16-1:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:16):**  world just focus on implementing, just get it working on the ground, ignore the critics.  
**[1:16:20-1:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:20):**  You don't need to convince every consumer to buy your food.  
**[1:16:23-1:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:23):**  You need to find the 10 that will and figure out how to make it profitable to serve those  
**[1:16:27-1:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:27):**  10 or those 100.  
**[1:16:28-1:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:28):**  I have to stay in business while the science is catching up, basically.  
**[1:16:31-1:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:31):**  Exactly.  
**[1:16:32-1:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:32):**  And then over time, we're going to get the data and the observational science, that first  
**[1:16:36-1:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:36):**  20 percent of the billion dollars, will start realizing, oh, you know, this is how that  
**[1:16:41-1:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:41):**  works.  
**[1:16:42-1:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:42):**  Now, having dug into this because of the way my mind works early on to the first principles  
**[1:16:46-1:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:46):**  of physics, I really think the flow of energy in the universe is on our side.  
**[1:16:51-1:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:51):**  So I'm not terribly concerned that there's like a fatal flaw that we're going to uncover.  
**[1:16:55-1:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:16:55):**  It floated up the levels I didn't even know existed before in considering why regenerative  
**[1:17:00-1:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:00):**  agriculture works.  
**[1:17:01-1:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:01):**  But the actual manifestation on the ground, how to make it work in business, how to make  
**[1:17:07-1:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:07):**  it work in different settings, these are all things that generations of practitioners and  
**[1:17:12-1:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:12):**  scientists will figure out.  
**[1:17:14-1:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:14):**  It just doesn't do us any good to get caught in debates that are historical at the moment  
**[1:17:19-1:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:19):**  when the urgent need here is to reinvent our food system in a way that simultaneously improves  
**[1:17:25-1:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:25):**  the health of both people and planet.  
**[1:17:27-1:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:27):**  And if there was one thing you could change overnight, so we take you away from your one  
**[1:17:31-1:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:31):**  billion dollars, I'm sorry, with a magic wand, there's one thing you can change overnight  
**[1:17:35-1:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:35):**  in the food system or in general, what would you do?  
**[1:17:38-1:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:38):**  Oh, good question.  
**[1:17:39-1:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:39):**  If I had a magic wand, so I could trick people's brains into doing things, I would wave it  
**[1:17:45-1:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:45):**  and have people learn to think in loops instead of lines.  
**[1:17:49-1:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:49):**  It's so foreign to the Western mind.  
**[1:17:52-1:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:52):**  You know, mechanistically, maybe we all need to go live with indigenous people for a while.  
**[1:17:58-1:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:17:58):**  1491, you know, if we could all transport back to 1491 and be observers in that system  
**[1:18:06-1:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:18:06):**  and learn from it, that would actually be a great way to learn to think in loops instead  
**[1:18:10-1:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:18:10):**  of lines.  
**[1:18:11-1:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:18:11):**  I think it would be so, so educational and so counter to everything we think we know.  
**[1:18:17-1:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:18:17):**  Yeah, there's so much we don't.  
**[1:18:19-1:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:18:19):**  I want to thank you so much, Russ, for this conversation.  
**[1:18:21-1:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:18:21):**  I don't think it's the last time we do that.  
**[1:18:23-1:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:18:23):**  We covered a lot, but still scratched the surface.  
**[1:18:27-1:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:18:27):**  And I want to wish you good luck in these crazy times to keep shipping and keep delivering  
**[1:18:32-1:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:18:32):**  to regenerative products to your customers.  
**[1:18:36-1:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:18:36):**  My pleasure.

**[1:19:27-1:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:19:27):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:19:32-1:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:19:32):**  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:19:36-1:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:19:36):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[1:19:40-1:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:19:40):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:19:41-1:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:19:41):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:19:46-1:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:19:46):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[1:19:51-1:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:19:51):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:19:55-1:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:19:55):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:19:58-1:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:19:58):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[1:20:00-1:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:20:00):**  What to focus on with the podcast?

**[1:21:20-1:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:21:20):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture

**[1:21:51-1:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:21:51):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:21:52-1:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:21:52):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:21:54-1:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:21:54):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:21:56-1:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:21:56):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:22:00-1:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:22:00):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:22:02-1:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:22:02):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:22:07-1:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/07/07/russ-conser#t=1:22:07):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

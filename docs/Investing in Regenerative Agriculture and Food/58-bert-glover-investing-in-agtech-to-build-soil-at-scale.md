**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:13):**  We're listening to an interview about agtech for building soils and how that is absolutely  crucial if we want to do regen ag at scale.  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:27-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:27):**  the planet mattered.  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:38-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:38):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:49-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:49):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:01):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:12):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more  depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:26):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  support me and make this happen.  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:38):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  Enjoy!  So welcome to another interview, this time with Bert Glover, co-founder of Impact Ag  
**[0:01:48-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:48):**  Partners, which manages a hundred and sixty million Australian dollars in land assets  on behalf of international and domestic investors in Australia.  This is our second interview, I've interviewed Bert before in April 2019 and definitely go  
**[0:01:59-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:59):**  back.  I will share the interview in the show notes below to hear more about Impact Ag Partners,  about the background and why it's into this space.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:06):**  But this time I wanted to dive deeper into technology.  We see a lot of very interesting ag tech coming out and we see a lot of that really focused  on building soils.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:16):**  So I would love to spend a bit of time with Bert and dive deeper into why he thinks ag  tech is so important in building soils.  Welcome Bert!  
**[0:02:24-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:24):**  Thanks Cohen.  So can you share a bit about your interest in ag tech basically and the companies you've  been involved in and basically how you got into this space?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:37):**  Yeah, thanks Cohen.  I guess I'll take us back, if I may, Cohen, to 2010.  And I touched on in our last podcast whereby Impact Ag Partners together with one of our  
**[0:02:51-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:51):**  investor clients, we were building a vertically integrated grass-fed beef business, utilising  our clients' assets.  And this was all around demonstrating, a way of demonstrating, I guess, how we were delivering  
**[0:03:08-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:08):**  ecosystem services and telling our story around production and regenerative agriculture and  how livestock played such a critical role in this.  And our investor client and us at Impact Ag Partners together with our soil and plant  
**[0:03:23-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:23):**  specialist Bart Davidson, we got to a point whereby we were sitting in the in the abattoir  once we'd done a production run and we had an amazing piece of meat, it was a strip loin  from memory, and we were looking at this beef and we were saying to ourselves and asking  
**[0:03:43-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:43):**  ourselves a question, if we're going to make a profitable, sustainable business out of  a grass-fed branded beef, how are we going to deliver this high quality beef on a consistent  basis to our customers?  
**[0:04:02-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:02):**  Not only deliver it from a quantity point of view, but a quality.  How are we going to keep that quality and that quantity to our customers?  And so we threw that around for a while and we got back to the fact that we were going  
**[0:04:15-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:15):**  to need some tools and one of those tools was technology.  We felt that in order to crack the nut and, you know, grass-fed beef has a somewhat of  a tainted reputation around inconsistent supply and inconsistent quality.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:34):**  So how are we going to build this consistency in our supply chain?  And it came back to planning and technology.  So if I go back to, you know, 2010, we started, like many people in technology, with a crazy  
**[0:04:50-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:50):**  Excel spreadsheet with I don't know how many tabs on it and trying to work out how we were  going to manage our livestock, manage our grass, and where we're going to be moving  livestock from and from which property to where and where our supplies were coming from  
**[0:05:05-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:05):**  and how long they were going to be on the farm, how many days on feed, what were our  weight gains going to be.  And we built this Excel spreadsheet and it didn't take too long and we realized we were  
**[0:05:18-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:18):**  pretty much out of our depth.  Even though one of us was quite strong in using Excel, we pretty much realized that  this was not going to cut it and we needed to find a partner to help us build this software.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:33):**  So that's what we did.  We found someone who had experience in the space based in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia,  and we started to work through with them what this might mean moving forward, what are the  
**[0:05:47-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:47):**  tools that we need, what are the answers we needed to move forward.  And it was interesting because when you start this process and you kind of start with a  blank canvas, you start thinking about, well, you need consistent genetics that, you know,  
**[0:06:05-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:05):**  cattle have got strong fertility attributes and meat quality attributes and good temperament.  And you look at, so that's the genetic side.  You look at nutrition side, animal nutrition this is, and you think about your pasture  
**[0:06:20-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:20):**  composition and biodiversity of that pasture and you look at what inputs you might need,  whether it's foliar sprays or soil inputs, and you look at your grazing management and  the environment that the cattle are living in, what's the water quality like and access  
**[0:06:35-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:35):**  to water quality.  And you start thinking about animal psychology and de-stressing the environment and all of  the things that come into managing a grass-fed beef business and the supply chain.  
**[0:06:50-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:50):**  And it became pretty clear to us after going through this process that the major limiting  factor to us was really about managing grass.  For a grass-fed beef business that was vertically integrated, we had to understand how to best  
**[0:07:08-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:08):**  manage our grass and that meant understanding how to match stocking rate to carrying capacity.  So that's kind of the early days of how my technology came about.  And this assumes or indicates that there wasn't something out there that helped grass-fed  
**[0:07:29-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:29):**  beef producers manage their grass.  Because if you had to first build a huge Excel spreadsheet and then turn it into a software  company which is not your core business or wasn't your core business and obviously can  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:42):**  be quite expensive and takes a lot of time, there wasn't something off the shelf you could  just buy and use.  That's exactly right.  
**[0:07:49-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:49):**  There was nothing off the shelf.  And actually, you know, other practitioners that were using what we call large-scale rotational  grazing in livestock systems, they were using a big piece of paper called a grazing chart.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:05):**  And a grazing chart has been used for many years and successfully.  So I guess for us, a grazing chart is only on the wall of the manager who's ever managing  the farm and that information is kept in one location.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:20):**  It's not in the cloud.  It can be daunting for new adopters and it takes some time and education to train.  And so for us, we wanted to digitize this.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:30):**  We wanted this to be something that you could walk around a farm with your phone or a laptop  anywhere in the world and you could see how many animals are on that farm, where they  were, how many days feed you've got ahead of them.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:44):**  You could run some predictive analytics and all this different analysis.  And so, you know, we set about building this ourselves.  And how has been that journey?  
**[0:08:56-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:56):**  Well, like any startup, I mean, it has its ups and downs.  And I mean, you kind of want to fail fast and cheap if you can.  But we are now in 2018 and there's, sorry, 2019.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:15):**  And yeah, customers globally and the product has come a long way and is really creating  value for multiple users.  And I guess that's really, originally, we weren't even going to commercialize this product.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:31):**  We realized that this would just be an in-house product, but it became very clear that there  was an appetite for this.  And so we took it to market as a software as a service business.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:41):**  And it's moved on.  It's helping people understand and match their stocking rate to carrying capacity, which  we know is critical in terms of managing grass and helping them past your budget.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:55):**  It's helping them, well, for us, helping us save time and being transparent with our information  and being cloud-based that information can be shared.  And for us, when we started with our beef business, we had to understand where the cattle  
**[0:10:14-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:14):**  are and how they're performing and how they were going to fit into the supply chain and  timing and all those sorts of things.  So it was ticking so many boxes for us, and of course, as it evolved and became commercial,  
**[0:10:26-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:26):**  there was so many other things that had to be improved and advanced on, and it's come  a long way, but it's getting real traction, which is fantastic.  Yeah, which is great.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:35):**  And how close, or maybe it's much further, actually, it went much further.  Is it to your original question of getting more consistent when it comes to grass-fed  beef?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:47):**  Or are you just delivering on that, basically on that question?  That's a good question.  I guess there's other economic stresses and inputs that have impact the grass-fed beef  
**[0:10:57-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:57):**  business.  I mean, I think the core of it to be a good grass-fed beef business that's vertically  integrated, it still comes down to pasture management and grass management.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:08):**  And our capacity to do that now and capability is completely different to where it was in  2011.  I mean, if I look back now at the businesses that are involved and how we manage grass  
**[0:11:22-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:22):**  and the impact that's had on our landscape and business profitability just by making  decisions early and being proactive, it's given us so many opportunities in the livestock  market to come into the market with confidence, buy livestock when we probably wouldn't have  
**[0:11:39-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:39):**  in the past, whilst markets are depressed.  And conversely, having the foresight to say, well, let's run these analytics and what does  it look like on this farm over the next six months?  
**[0:11:52-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:52):**  And what if we don't maybe sell our livestock due to drought now, what might that look like  in the future?  And I've seen multiple case studies where we've saved producers $25,000, $30,000 just  
**[0:12:08-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:08):**  by making decisions that month or two months earlier than they normally would without a  product like ours.  And that has a major impact.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:18):**  And I think for us as well, we've got a broader vision here.  And our vision is still around building soil health and landscape restoration.  This product has really helped in that regard in terms of managing ground cover and helping  
**[0:12:36-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:36):**  biodiversity and pasture composition and build natural capital and all those sorts of things.  So it's ticking so many of those goals, which is great.  And when you look at the piece of software, so one thing is it to take a grazing plan  
**[0:12:53-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:53):**  and digitalise it and basically keep track of information.  Another thing is, and you mentioned it a few times now, is predicting what's going to happen  in the future, which normally happened in the mind of the farmer and a manager, but  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:05):**  of course, not on a grazing plan.  How is that happening?  Like to go from, okay, things that you could also do on paper, but it's nice to have in  
**[0:13:11-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:11):**  the cloud, so you can have access to it in London, etc. to actually something that is  not a, that you cannot do on paper, but that technology can actually do for you.  How has it been developing that side?  
**[0:13:23-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:23):**  Yeah, so this is where I, you know, for us at Impact AG, and we use this across all our  assets, this is what one of the areas that we really enjoy internally in our business,  because we, you know, because it's cloud-based, this product, we can look at all our farms  
**[0:13:39-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:39):**  and have really good insights into what the future looks like and what the grazing plans  are.  And so what it, primarily what the product enables you to do is to say, well, here I  
**[0:13:50-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:50):**  am today and this is the amount of livestock I have, this is the rainfall I've had over  the last X amount of months or years.  And my position today, I'm quite, let's say I'm quite comfortable with it, and I want  
**[0:14:06-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:06):**  to know and I want to start thinking about and I want to start putting a plan towards  what the next 12 months might look like.  And so if I can, I can go into the product and say, well, this is the amount of what  
**[0:14:20-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:20):**  we should call livestock load or the amount of livestock I think I'm going to carry over,  let's just call it the next 12 months, and I can run scenarios around what I think the  rainfall predictions might be over those 12 months.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:34):**  And I can run those, punch them into the system and run all these what-if scenarios.  And then I'll put that in the system and it'll give me a forecast and I'll get an understanding  on in terms of whether I'm going to be understocked or overstocked over that period.  
**[0:14:48-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:48):**  And if I do take this action, where is the opportunity or conversely, where might there  be risk and what's going to happen for this plan to execute successfully?  And I'll look at that and go, well, okay, well that's using those assumptions.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:07):**  And I can quickly just change those assumptions and within five seconds, I can have a different  set of assumptions and tell me a different story all in front of me on a screen and I  can share it or whatever, whereby in the past, if that was a paper-based tool, then there's  
**[0:15:26-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:26):**  a lot of erasing and frustration and waste.  And by using technology, I mean, it's completely changed the way we plan.  It's completely changed the way we actually do farm budgeting.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:40):**  We start our farm budgeting process now by using this software that says pretty much  over the next 12 months, these are the assumptions I'm making about the season and these are  the assumptions I'm using around livestock and the amount of my carrying capacity through  
**[0:15:58-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:58):**  those periods and I can change them on a monthly basis and use different assumptions.  And then from that, we can then spit it out and say, well, okay, that's what we think  we're going to do for the year and then we put some financials to it.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:10):**  So it's really changed the way we manage financially on the farm.  It's changed the way we manage our stocking rate.  It's giving us analytics around, and this is another thing that we're really excited  
**[0:16:22-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:22):**  about is now the amount of analytics that are coming out of this to make the decisions  around capital expenditure in the future and where performance is coming from, both at  the land level and at the livestock level.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:35):**  And I'm imagining it also helped the communication and reporting to your investors and your clients.  Definitely.  So if we've got investors in London or US or Geneva, as an example, at any given point  
**[0:16:49-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:49):**  in time, they can log in and see how things are tracking on the farm and they can drill  into what our grazing plans are.  They can look at on our map on our homepage and see where the livestock are and they can  
**[0:17:02-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:02):**  click on the livestock and see how many are there and where they're from and how much  that cost and what the margin could be there.  And it's just given so much transparency.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:15):**  It's created a tool and the numbers and the metrics are the facts.  And the facts just take out any subjectivity in a discussion around farm performance and  opportunities for the future and livestock numbers and carrying capacity, what we can  
**[0:17:37-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:37):**  and can't do.  The facts just tell the story.  And for us, it's been a bit of a game changer from a management point of view.  
**[0:17:45-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:45):**  And are you using any in terms of sensors, satellite imagery, drone imagery, are you  using any of that as an input?  So we have started to use weather input, which is satellite input.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:01):**  We've also on our platform started to build out the software for third parties.  So primarily IoT businesses that are interested in integrating IoT into farm management software.  Just for people who don't know, IoT is, so what is IoT?  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:25):**  It's the internet.  I'm blanking out.  Internet of things.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:28):**  Internet of things.  Thank you.  So things like on farm rain gauges, on farm water storage facilities.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:36):**  So you can have a sensor that tells you how much water is in a water tank in a water reservoir.  We're building out things for another third party around what we call virtual fencing.  So virtual fencing is you may be aware where livestock have a tag or a collar that has  
**[0:18:54-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:54):**  GPS capability.  How is that market developing?  Because I've seen, but that was quite a few years ago, actually something on Goats, I  
**[0:19:02-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:02):**  think in Norway, and always intrigued by the idea, but I haven't seen it too much.  But it maybe means I haven't been paying attention.  What's been happening in the virtual fencing market?  
**[0:19:14-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:14):**  Well I think there's two key things.  One is that the hardware, I guess, has always been the challenge in this space.  And the hardware being either a collar around an animal's neck or an ear tag and being able  
**[0:19:27-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:27):**  to get enough solar energy into either of those two to drive battery so that you've  got long life.  And so that's at the hardware space.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:39):**  And that's getting more and more refined.  And it should be very close to being commercialized.  So that's that part.  
**[0:19:47-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:47):**  And then in terms of the software, well we've built some software for one of those businesses.  And it's very interesting and it's going to be very dynamic.  If you think about a farm, in theory, could probably have one fence around its boundary,  
**[0:20:04-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:04):**  its perimeter, and no other permanent fence on it.  And the only fence is a virtual fence which you the farmer move on your phone or tablet  or computer.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:15):**  You can create an area where the livestock can and cannot go.  So let's explain it a bit because I think not everybody knows virtual fencing.  So it's basically either an earpiece or a collar when the animal, so the farmer, like  
**[0:20:27-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:27):**  you described on his or her phone or iPad or tablet, drew a line, a virtual fence.  And as soon as the animal gets close to that, it either gets some sound or it gets some  kind of signal that there is a fence or there is a barrier there which is annoying to the  
**[0:20:42-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:42):**  animal.  And the animal will basically try to stay a bit away from that and thus staying into  the virtual fence because there's no real fence.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:50):**  That's correct.  And that's how it works.  So if you think about the capital requirement for standard structured fencing and materials  
**[0:20:59-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:59):**  and labor and the limitation that puts on you from a grazing management point of view,  it's really exciting when it comes to...  It's a potential game changer.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:09):**  How is it for the animal?  Does she, probably she, understand because the electricity part or the fence at least  is a visual thing.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:19):**  Are there going to be a lot of discussions around animal welfare on this or what's your  view on that?  There could be.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:25):**  And there could be animal welfare discussions on both sides.  I mean, I guess there's an argument to say that by using a collar or an ear tag that  has a noise and then if the animal is not responding, if it gets a small electric pulse,  
**[0:21:41-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:41):**  is that worse than an animal running into a fence that has barbs on it or an electric  fence that gets a 10,000 volt shock?  So I guess there's arguments on both sides.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:54):**  And again, it comes down to educating the animals and doing it in a manner that delivers  strong welfare.  And I guess if all of a sudden we're moving livestock virtually...  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:08):**  Which sounds really funny because of course they're not moving virtually, they're also  moving in real life.  But yeah, I get your point.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:13):**  Yeah, they're moving in real life.  It's not Farmville.  We're not playing some kind of farm simulator.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:18):**  Exactly.  But the fencing is being moved and maybe there's less stress through animal anticipation and  the movement and handling of livestock.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:29):**  Well, I guess there could be welfare benefits there and performance benefits as well.  So still early days in terms of the amount of virtual fencing that's out there in terms  of the hardware on livestock, still plenty of trials happening.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:44):**  But I think the potential gains are so high that it's definitely worth pursuing further.  And there is, I think I know of about three startups that are really driving hard in the  space.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:58):**  So watch this space in that regard.  Yeah, it's very exciting.  I think it's one of those examples where you can see AgTech really being a game changer  
**[0:23:06-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:06):**  for building soils.  We see a lot of AgTech, I mean, the news is constantly out there, how much money is being  raised for AgTech, how much money goes into vertical farming, how much money goes into  
**[0:23:15-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:15):**  conventional chemical input precision software for something, but not too much or not enough.  I think we both agree on that is going into AgTech actually to help farmers and landowners  and land managers build soil faster.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:30):**  But I think that space is going to explode just as much as virtual fencing, because there's  so much we cannot even grasp that we can actually do with technology, like, of course, digitalising  something like you did, but then actually taking it five steps further, and maybe in  
**[0:23:45-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:45):**  the future, even 10 is, I think, very exciting.  If you're in the tech space, and you're interested in Ag, really focus on that piece on how do  you help people build soil faster?  
**[0:23:56-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:56):**  Yeah, exactly.  And there's new things coming out all the time and new initiatives.  I mean, I've just seen one this week whereby these new soil probes that not only measure  
**[0:24:08-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:08):**  moisture, the probes go down one metre, and they measure carbon at different levels within  the soil, they measure nitrogen, phosphorus, they're connected by a hub.  And that could be amazing technology when it comes to unlocking the opportunities around  
**[0:24:30-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:30):**  soil carbon markets and the access for farmers to participate in the carbon market without  having to do regular testing just by having probes in the ground that are delivering information,  and also helping with day to day management around moisture in the profile, nutrient in  
**[0:24:49-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:49):**  the profile.  It's really exciting.  And hopefully, you know, we can see some of these bear fruit and come to light.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:57):**  Yeah, because I think it's, I mean, for a farmer or farm manager, you can observe a  lot and obviously you should.  But especially if you're running bigger farms, let's say larger than a few hectares, it becomes  
**[0:25:09-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:09):**  very difficult to be to have your ears and eyes on the ground, or everywhere all the  time.  And then you move to a country like Australia, where farms are gigantic, you need to take  
**[0:25:18-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:18):**  a small plane to fly from one end to the other.  It becomes completely impossible to make decisions if you don't have those inputs.  And if you don't somewhere store it, because like our mind is just not big enough to, to  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:31):**  see it and also to connect the dots in that.  So it's such a crucial, crucial piece.  What do you see?  
**[0:25:37-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:37):**  I mean, you've done, you're still building, but like the prediction software, the grass  fat management piece, what is another piece you're very excited about or something like  a big question you have, just like you had when you saw that amazing piece of meat and  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:52):**  you said, how do we get there consistently?  Is there another big thing that you see missing?  Is that the soil carbon piece?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:58):**  Or is that something else?  I mean, the soil carbon piece, that is, that is something we're really interested in.  And, and really looking closely globally at the leaders in some of the new technologies  
**[0:26:11-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:11):**  in that space.  But I guess in terms of Maya, one of the things that we're interested in at the moment is  the behavioral science of animals and we're looking at ear tags in livestock that can  
**[0:26:25-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:25):**  again through GPS give us some insights into the behavior of animals.  So it can help us understand things like if their heart rate changes, if their, you know,  their adrenaline levels rise, if they're distressed, we can track them.  
**[0:26:44-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:44):**  So things like we can tell if an animal is starting to show signs of distress and by  looking at its behavior, we can see its movement and watch it, well, you know, on our computer  screen, we can see where it's moving.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:01):**  Is it, does it look like it's restless?  Is it not comfortable in its environment?  Therefore are we meeting all of its needs in terms of environment and nutrition and  
**[0:27:11-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:11):**  water?  So we can start to use that information again to track livestock behavior in terms of grazing  pattern and start to overlay maps in terms of grazing yield and where all of the pasture  
**[0:27:26-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:26):**  is being harvested.  And then we can get some understanding in terms of where the nutrient drawdown is within  a pasture or a field.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:34):**  So some of the behavioral science stuff we find interesting.  And if you go a step further, if you can see where your livestock are as individuals and  let's say every 15 minutes or 10 minutes, you know, the satellite is beaming us information  
**[0:27:52-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:52):**  in terms of the location of each animal, you can start thinking about, well, this becomes  a security tool.  So if someone tries to steal my animals or one of my animals just gets out through a  
**[0:28:03-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:03):**  fence and is, you know, over on a neighbor's, you can start using these things for, for  security and theft.  And also things like an animal hasn't moved for a day.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:15):**  Does that mean, and is that animal a high value animal?  Is that a bull or a ram?  And is that, you know, that might be a $20,000 animal and has it injured itself or is it,  
**[0:28:26-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:26):**  you know, why is it not active?  So behavioral science is something that's quite interesting and for us, we're exploring  this further.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:35):**  So yeah, watch this space.  That's extremely, extremely exciting.  I think we can just like when you, you stand in a landscape, you can barely imagine what  
**[0:28:45-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:45):**  is possible or what used to be.  We always look at maybe records of 20 years or 50 years or, or, but as we see now, some  experiments coming up, like we don't know what a healthy pasture, maybe we don't know  
**[0:28:57-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:57):**  the mix of trees, we don't know how it used to be with large groups of animals.  We cannot even imagine that, but we can also not imagine what technology can do for us  or with us in terms of management and what kind of data, like a simple between record  
**[0:29:11-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:11):**  air tech can, can get you.  And maybe we found out that in the middle of the night, always at three, all the cows  gather for something or, or they all go around a certain tree or they self medicate around  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:22):**  something.  There's, there's so much to discover there.  I think we're going to be very surprised.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:27):**  Yeah, I agree.  And I mean, smart tags play a key role in, in understanding that.  And I think from a landscape point of view and a soil point of view, you know, understanding  
**[0:29:39-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:39):**  at the farm level, you know, production yields within a landscape.  So what areas are performing superior to others and is that got to do with the soil type?  Is it, and what does that say about cation exchange and water holding capacity?  
**[0:29:55-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:55):**  And what's limiting in our soils or what's not limiting?  Where would we, how would we either fix a problem or enhance a good attribute?  Where might we deploy capital and invest in our farm based on where our livestock are  
**[0:30:10-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:10):**  harvesting?  And one of the other observations is it got to do with pasture composition or all the  things around diversity and ground cover.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:19):**  So it can play a landscape role as well to help us understand watersheds and ecosystems  by animal behavior and you know, they're animals as we know, they're intuitive and they've  grown in, in nature.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:34):**  So they can tell us so much.  So maybe with some of this data and analytics, we can start to learn so much more about our  soil and plants and environments that, that we're trying to work with in farming systems.  
**[0:30:47-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:47):**  Yeah, they can be great and not too silent, but it can be great sensors, obviously, if  they don't like to be somewhere, they, and we don't force them, they won't go.  And there's, especially as we're getting region act two scale where, like you said, we're  
**[0:31:01-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:01):**  going to look at watershed levels, we're looking at landscape levels, we're looking at millions  of acres or millions of hectares even.  We have to figure out a lot more about the landscape than we know now.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:12):**  And we can do a lot through satellite, we can do lots of sensors, but we can probably  do a lot through observing ourselves and a lot of indigenous knowledge, but also observing  animals and observing how they behave in a landscape and how we can actually regenerate  
**[0:31:26-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:26):**  a full landscape instead of just, again, within brackets, just a farm, which might be enormous,  but it could also be very small.  And at the end of the day, we need many more million hectares under region management and  
**[0:31:38-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:38):**  under the best region management to store as much carbon water and produce the food.  Yeah, exactly, and I think, you know, one of the things we were conscious of in building  this product, my grazing was what is all of the things that this data is telling us and  
**[0:31:55-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:55):**  how can we utilise it?  And one of the things we were conscious of is building into our product the capability  whereby the product could be used for carbon accounting in the future.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:09):**  So understanding things like where livestock have been throughout their life and where  they've harvested grass and inputs and outputs and all the things required to meet regulator  requirements, we built that in early.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:27):**  And all these things are contributing to building natural capital.  So for us, it ticks so many boxes in terms of managing our landscapes better, building  natural capital, creating more profitable businesses, ensuring livestock have strong  
**[0:32:46-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:46):**  and positive outcomes, enabling our people to save time and energy, but be proactive  and be able to make decisions with confidence.  So it ticks so many boxes for us using technology like this.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:03):**  And I kind of feel like if the regenerative movement is going to advance further, we need  to unpack and explore other opportunities for technology because I think that's going  to facilitate and support, you know, capital flows into the sector.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:21):**  We need to be demonstrating.  We've got the tools to perform regenerative ag and again, you know, we need the markets,  we need the people and we need the capital, but if we've got the tools and the tools are  
**[0:33:36-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:36):**  software products along with other tools, I think, you know, we're going to be in a  long way of improving our soils and our ecosystems as we work together with farming businesses.  And I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:33:51-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:51):**  So a final question, which I borrowed from John Kemp and I adjusted a bit to this podcast.  What do you believe is true about RegenAg that others don't believe to be true?  I don't know what others don't believe to be true, but there's a couple of things I  
**[0:34:07-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:07):**  know and I'm passionate about.  And one is that since we've been utilizing regenerative agriculture, we're very confident  it works.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:18):**  Point number one.  Point number two, it's definitely the future.  And we need to ensure that we adopt these practices more broadly and help some of our  
**[0:34:33-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:33):**  colleagues and friends and other farmers make the change and ensure them that yes, change  is difficult and change sometimes is scary, but it can be very rewarding.  And I think our climate and our nature is telling us that things have got to change.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:54):**  And you know, regenerative agriculture is definitely something that we need to try and  enhance into the future.  I want to thank you so much, Bert.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:05):**  We talked a lot about cows and technology in this podcast, but in the future, and as  a teaser, we're going to do more on row cropping.  And I think there's a huge role for technology there as well.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:15):**  And actually the interaction between row cropping and livestock, I mean, there's so much more  to uncover.  It's always a pleasure to talk to you.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:22):**  Was a great interview we did in April, and I'm very happy to do another one now today.  So I'll be checking in with you and thank you so much for sharing your technology journey  this time.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:32):**  Thanks, Cohen.  And I'd just like to say that we really appreciate the work that you put into this and your initiative  and banding together like minded people.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:43):**  So congratulations for your initiative as well.  Thank you so much.  You just listened to an interview with Bert Clover, co-founder of Impact Ag Partners about  
**[0:35:53-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:53):**  ag tech in building soils.  I hope you learned something about the role of technologies can play in the region ag  and food space.

**[0:36:53-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:36:53):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:37:03-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:03):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:16):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:24):**  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:29):**  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?  
**[0:37:33-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:33):**  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:40):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:54):**  People that are building soil at scale.  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:38:04-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:04):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  Is this course free?  No.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:11):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:23):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:32):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:42):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:38:57-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:57):**  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:39:07):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:39:15):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:39:23):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

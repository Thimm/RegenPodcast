**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:13):**  We're listening to an interview about agtech for building soils and how that is absolutely  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:17):**  crucial if we want to do regen ag at scale.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:23):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:27-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:27):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:28):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:33):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:38):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:43):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:45):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:49):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:52):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:00:56):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:01):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:05):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:09):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:12):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:17):**  depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:22):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:26):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:31-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:31):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:38):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:42):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:43):**  So welcome to another interview, this time with Bert Glover, co-founder of Impact Ag  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:48):**  Partners, which manages a hundred and sixty million Australian dollars in land assets  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:51):**  on behalf of international and domestic investors in Australia.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:54):**  This is our second interview, I've interviewed Bert before in April 2019 and definitely go  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:01:59):**  back.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:00):**  I will share the interview in the show notes below to hear more about Impact Ag Partners,  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:04):**  about the background and why it's into this space.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:06):**  But this time I wanted to dive deeper into technology.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:09):**  We see a lot of very interesting ag tech coming out and we see a lot of that really focused  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:15):**  on building soils.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:16):**  So I would love to spend a bit of time with Bert and dive deeper into why he thinks ag  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:21):**  tech is so important in building soils.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:23):**  Welcome Bert!  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:24):**  Thanks Cohen.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:25):**  So can you share a bit about your interest in ag tech basically and the companies you've  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:32):**  been involved in and basically how you got into this space?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:37):**  Yeah, thanks Cohen.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:38):**  I guess I'll take us back, if I may, Cohen, to 2010.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:45):**  And I touched on in our last podcast whereby Impact Ag Partners together with one of our  
**[0:02:51-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:51):**  investor clients, we were building a vertically integrated grass-fed beef business, utilising  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:02:59):**  our clients' assets.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:01):**  And this was all around demonstrating, a way of demonstrating, I guess, how we were delivering  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:08):**  ecosystem services and telling our story around production and regenerative agriculture and  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:14):**  how livestock played such a critical role in this.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:17):**  And our investor client and us at Impact Ag Partners together with our soil and plant  
**[0:03:23-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:23):**  specialist Bart Davidson, we got to a point whereby we were sitting in the in the abattoir  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:31):**  once we'd done a production run and we had an amazing piece of meat, it was a strip loin  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:37):**  from memory, and we were looking at this beef and we were saying to ourselves and asking  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:43):**  ourselves a question, if we're going to make a profitable, sustainable business out of  
**[0:03:50-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:50):**  a grass-fed branded beef, how are we going to deliver this high quality beef on a consistent  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:03:59):**  basis to our customers?  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:02):**  Not only deliver it from a quantity point of view, but a quality.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:05):**  How are we going to keep that quality and that quantity to our customers?  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:10):**  And so we threw that around for a while and we got back to the fact that we were going  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:15):**  to need some tools and one of those tools was technology.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:20):**  We felt that in order to crack the nut and, you know, grass-fed beef has a somewhat of  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:28):**  a tainted reputation around inconsistent supply and inconsistent quality.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:34):**  So how are we going to build this consistency in our supply chain?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:39):**  And it came back to planning and technology.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:42):**  So if I go back to, you know, 2010, we started, like many people in technology, with a crazy  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:50):**  Excel spreadsheet with I don't know how many tabs on it and trying to work out how we were  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:04:56):**  going to manage our livestock, manage our grass, and where we're going to be moving  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:01):**  livestock from and from which property to where and where our supplies were coming from  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:05):**  and how long they were going to be on the farm, how many days on feed, what were our  
**[0:05:09-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:09):**  weight gains going to be.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:11):**  And we built this Excel spreadsheet and it didn't take too long and we realized we were  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:18):**  pretty much out of our depth.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:19):**  Even though one of us was quite strong in using Excel, we pretty much realized that  
**[0:05:25-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:25):**  this was not going to cut it and we needed to find a partner to help us build this software.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:33):**  So that's what we did.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:34):**  We found someone who had experience in the space based in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia,  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:41):**  and we started to work through with them what this might mean moving forward, what are the  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:47):**  tools that we need, what are the answers we needed to move forward.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:53):**  And it was interesting because when you start this process and you kind of start with a  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:05:59):**  blank canvas, you start thinking about, well, you need consistent genetics that, you know,  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:05):**  cattle have got strong fertility attributes and meat quality attributes and good temperament.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:12):**  And you look at, so that's the genetic side.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:15):**  You look at nutrition side, animal nutrition this is, and you think about your pasture  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:20):**  composition and biodiversity of that pasture and you look at what inputs you might need,  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:26):**  whether it's foliar sprays or soil inputs, and you look at your grazing management and  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:31):**  the environment that the cattle are living in, what's the water quality like and access  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:35):**  to water quality.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:37):**  And you start thinking about animal psychology and de-stressing the environment and all of  
**[0:06:43-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:43):**  the things that come into managing a grass-fed beef business and the supply chain.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:50):**  And it became pretty clear to us after going through this process that the major limiting  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:06:57):**  factor to us was really about managing grass.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:03):**  For a grass-fed beef business that was vertically integrated, we had to understand how to best  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:08):**  manage our grass and that meant understanding how to match stocking rate to carrying capacity.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:15):**  So that's kind of the early days of how my technology came about.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:20):**  And this assumes or indicates that there wasn't something out there that helped grass-fed  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:29):**  beef producers manage their grass.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:32):**  Because if you had to first build a huge Excel spreadsheet and then turn it into a software  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:37):**  company which is not your core business or wasn't your core business and obviously can  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:42):**  be quite expensive and takes a lot of time, there wasn't something off the shelf you could  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:46):**  just buy and use.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:48):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:49):**  There was nothing off the shelf.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:51):**  And actually, you know, other practitioners that were using what we call large-scale rotational  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:07:59):**  grazing in livestock systems, they were using a big piece of paper called a grazing chart.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:05):**  And a grazing chart has been used for many years and successfully.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:10):**  So I guess for us, a grazing chart is only on the wall of the manager who's ever managing  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:17):**  the farm and that information is kept in one location.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:20):**  It's not in the cloud.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:22):**  It can be daunting for new adopters and it takes some time and education to train.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:26):**  And so for us, we wanted to digitize this.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:30):**  We wanted this to be something that you could walk around a farm with your phone or a laptop  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:36):**  anywhere in the world and you could see how many animals are on that farm, where they  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:41):**  were, how many days feed you've got ahead of them.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:44):**  You could run some predictive analytics and all this different analysis.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:49):**  And so, you know, we set about building this ourselves.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:53):**  And how has been that journey?  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:08:56):**  Well, like any startup, I mean, it has its ups and downs.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:00):**  And I mean, you kind of want to fail fast and cheap if you can.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:05):**  But we are now in 2018 and there's, sorry, 2019.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:15):**  And yeah, customers globally and the product has come a long way and is really creating  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:23):**  value for multiple users.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:26):**  And I guess that's really, originally, we weren't even going to commercialize this product.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:31):**  We realized that this would just be an in-house product, but it became very clear that there  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:36):**  was an appetite for this.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:37):**  And so we took it to market as a software as a service business.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:41):**  And it's moved on.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:44):**  It's helping people understand and match their stocking rate to carrying capacity, which  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:49):**  we know is critical in terms of managing grass and helping them past your budget.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:09:55):**  It's helping them, well, for us, helping us save time and being transparent with our information  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:01):**  and being cloud-based that information can be shared.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:06):**  And for us, when we started with our beef business, we had to understand where the cattle  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:14):**  are and how they're performing and how they were going to fit into the supply chain and  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:17):**  timing and all those sorts of things.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:20):**  So it was ticking so many boxes for us, and of course, as it evolved and became commercial,  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:26):**  there was so many other things that had to be improved and advanced on, and it's come  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:30):**  a long way, but it's getting real traction, which is fantastic.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:34):**  Yeah, which is great.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:35):**  And how close, or maybe it's much further, actually, it went much further.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:40):**  Is it to your original question of getting more consistent when it comes to grass-fed  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:46):**  beef?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:47):**  Or are you just delivering on that, basically on that question?  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:51):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:52):**  I guess there's other economic stresses and inputs that have impact the grass-fed beef  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:57):**  business.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:10:58):**  I mean, I think the core of it to be a good grass-fed beef business that's vertically  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:03):**  integrated, it still comes down to pasture management and grass management.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:08):**  And our capacity to do that now and capability is completely different to where it was in  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:16):**  2011.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:17):**  I mean, if I look back now at the businesses that are involved and how we manage grass  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:22):**  and the impact that's had on our landscape and business profitability just by making  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:27):**  decisions early and being proactive, it's given us so many opportunities in the livestock  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:32):**  market to come into the market with confidence, buy livestock when we probably wouldn't have  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:39):**  in the past, whilst markets are depressed.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:42):**  And conversely, having the foresight to say, well, let's run these analytics and what does  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:50):**  it look like on this farm over the next six months?  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:52):**  And what if we don't maybe sell our livestock due to drought now, what might that look like  
**[0:11:59-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:11:59):**  in the future?  
**[0:12:00-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:00):**  And I've seen multiple case studies where we've saved producers $25,000, $30,000 just  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:08):**  by making decisions that month or two months earlier than they normally would without a  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:14):**  product like ours.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:15):**  And that has a major impact.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:18):**  And I think for us as well, we've got a broader vision here.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:23):**  And our vision is still around building soil health and landscape restoration.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:30):**  This product has really helped in that regard in terms of managing ground cover and helping  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:36):**  biodiversity and pasture composition and build natural capital and all those sorts of things.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:42):**  So it's ticking so many of those goals, which is great.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:46):**  And when you look at the piece of software, so one thing is it to take a grazing plan  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:53):**  and digitalise it and basically keep track of information.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:12:56):**  Another thing is, and you mentioned it a few times now, is predicting what's going to happen  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:00):**  in the future, which normally happened in the mind of the farmer and a manager, but  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:05):**  of course, not on a grazing plan.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:07):**  How is that happening?  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:08):**  Like to go from, okay, things that you could also do on paper, but it's nice to have in  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:11):**  the cloud, so you can have access to it in London, etc. to actually something that is  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:15):**  not a, that you cannot do on paper, but that technology can actually do for you.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:21):**  How has it been developing that side?  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:23):**  Yeah, so this is where I, you know, for us at Impact AG, and we use this across all our  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:29):**  assets, this is what one of the areas that we really enjoy internally in our business,  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:33):**  because we, you know, because it's cloud-based, this product, we can look at all our farms  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:39):**  and have really good insights into what the future looks like and what the grazing plans  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:44):**  are.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:45):**  And so what it, primarily what the product enables you to do is to say, well, here I  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:50):**  am today and this is the amount of livestock I have, this is the rainfall I've had over  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:13:56):**  the last X amount of months or years.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:00):**  And my position today, I'm quite, let's say I'm quite comfortable with it, and I want  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:06):**  to know and I want to start thinking about and I want to start putting a plan towards  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:10):**  what the next 12 months might look like.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:14):**  And so if I can, I can go into the product and say, well, this is the amount of what  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:20):**  we should call livestock load or the amount of livestock I think I'm going to carry over,  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:24):**  let's just call it the next 12 months, and I can run scenarios around what I think the  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:30):**  rainfall predictions might be over those 12 months.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:34):**  And I can run those, punch them into the system and run all these what-if scenarios.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:39):**  And then I'll put that in the system and it'll give me a forecast and I'll get an understanding  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:43):**  on in terms of whether I'm going to be understocked or overstocked over that period.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:48):**  And if I do take this action, where is the opportunity or conversely, where might there  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:14:55):**  be risk and what's going to happen for this plan to execute successfully?  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:00):**  And I'll look at that and go, well, okay, well that's using those assumptions.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:07):**  And I can quickly just change those assumptions and within five seconds, I can have a different  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:14):**  set of assumptions and tell me a different story all in front of me on a screen and I  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:20):**  can share it or whatever, whereby in the past, if that was a paper-based tool, then there's  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:26):**  a lot of erasing and frustration and waste.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:31):**  And by using technology, I mean, it's completely changed the way we plan.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:36):**  It's completely changed the way we actually do farm budgeting.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:40):**  We start our farm budgeting process now by using this software that says pretty much  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:47):**  over the next 12 months, these are the assumptions I'm making about the season and these are  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:52):**  the assumptions I'm using around livestock and the amount of my carrying capacity through  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:15:58):**  those periods and I can change them on a monthly basis and use different assumptions.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:03):**  And then from that, we can then spit it out and say, well, okay, that's what we think  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:07):**  we're going to do for the year and then we put some financials to it.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:10):**  So it's really changed the way we manage financially on the farm.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:14):**  It's changed the way we manage our stocking rate.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:17):**  It's giving us analytics around, and this is another thing that we're really excited  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:22):**  about is now the amount of analytics that are coming out of this to make the decisions  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:27):**  around capital expenditure in the future and where performance is coming from, both at  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:32):**  the land level and at the livestock level.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:35):**  And I'm imagining it also helped the communication and reporting to your investors and your clients.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:42):**  Definitely.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:43):**  So if we've got investors in London or US or Geneva, as an example, at any given point  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:49):**  in time, they can log in and see how things are tracking on the farm and they can drill  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:55):**  into what our grazing plans are.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:16:57):**  They can look at on our map on our homepage and see where the livestock are and they can  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:02):**  click on the livestock and see how many are there and where they're from and how much  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:06):**  that cost and what the margin could be there.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:11):**  And it's just given so much transparency.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:15):**  It's created a tool and the numbers and the metrics are the facts.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:22):**  And the facts just take out any subjectivity in a discussion around farm performance and  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:32):**  opportunities for the future and livestock numbers and carrying capacity, what we can  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:37):**  and can't do.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:38):**  The facts just tell the story.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:40):**  And for us, it's been a bit of a game changer from a management point of view.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:45):**  And are you using any in terms of sensors, satellite imagery, drone imagery, are you  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:52):**  using any of that as an input?  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:17:55):**  So we have started to use weather input, which is satellite input.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:01):**  We've also on our platform started to build out the software for third parties.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:09):**  So primarily IoT businesses that are interested in integrating IoT into farm management software.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:21):**  Just for people who don't know, IoT is, so what is IoT?  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:25):**  It's the internet.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:26):**  I'm blanking out.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:27):**  Internet of things.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:28):**  Internet of things.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:29):**  Thank you.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:30):**  So things like on farm rain gauges, on farm water storage facilities.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:36):**  So you can have a sensor that tells you how much water is in a water tank in a water reservoir.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:42):**  We're building out things for another third party around what we call virtual fencing.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:47):**  So virtual fencing is you may be aware where livestock have a tag or a collar that has  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:54):**  GPS capability.  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:57):**  How is that market developing?  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:18:58):**  Because I've seen, but that was quite a few years ago, actually something on Goats, I  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:02):**  think in Norway, and always intrigued by the idea, but I haven't seen it too much.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:09):**  But it maybe means I haven't been paying attention.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:12):**  What's been happening in the virtual fencing market?  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:14):**  Well I think there's two key things.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:16):**  One is that the hardware, I guess, has always been the challenge in this space.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:21):**  And the hardware being either a collar around an animal's neck or an ear tag and being able  
**[0:19:27-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:27):**  to get enough solar energy into either of those two to drive battery so that you've  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:35):**  got long life.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:37):**  And so that's at the hardware space.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:39):**  And that's getting more and more refined.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:42):**  And it should be very close to being commercialized.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:46):**  So that's that part.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:47):**  And then in terms of the software, well we've built some software for one of those businesses.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:53):**  And it's very interesting and it's going to be very dynamic.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:19:57):**  If you think about a farm, in theory, could probably have one fence around its boundary,  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:04):**  its perimeter, and no other permanent fence on it.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:08):**  And the only fence is a virtual fence which you the farmer move on your phone or tablet  
**[0:20:14-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:14):**  or computer.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:15):**  You can create an area where the livestock can and cannot go.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:18):**  So let's explain it a bit because I think not everybody knows virtual fencing.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:22):**  So it's basically either an earpiece or a collar when the animal, so the farmer, like  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:27):**  you described on his or her phone or iPad or tablet, drew a line, a virtual fence.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:33):**  And as soon as the animal gets close to that, it either gets some sound or it gets some  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:38):**  kind of signal that there is a fence or there is a barrier there which is annoying to the  
**[0:20:42-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:42):**  animal.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:43):**  And the animal will basically try to stay a bit away from that and thus staying into  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:48):**  the virtual fence because there's no real fence.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:50):**  That's correct.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:51):**  And that's how it works.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:52):**  So if you think about the capital requirement for standard structured fencing and materials  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:20:59):**  and labor and the limitation that puts on you from a grazing management point of view,  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:05):**  it's really exciting when it comes to...  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:08):**  It's a potential game changer.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:09):**  How is it for the animal?  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:11):**  Does she, probably she, understand because the electricity part or the fence at least  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:17):**  is a visual thing.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:19):**  Are there going to be a lot of discussions around animal welfare on this or what's your  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:23):**  view on that?  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:24):**  There could be.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:25):**  And there could be animal welfare discussions on both sides.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:29):**  I mean, I guess there's an argument to say that by using a collar or an ear tag that  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:36):**  has a noise and then if the animal is not responding, if it gets a small electric pulse,  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:41):**  is that worse than an animal running into a fence that has barbs on it or an electric  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:46):**  fence that gets a 10,000 volt shock?  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:49):**  So I guess there's arguments on both sides.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:21:54):**  And again, it comes down to educating the animals and doing it in a manner that delivers  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:00):**  strong welfare.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:01):**  And I guess if all of a sudden we're moving livestock virtually...  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:08):**  Which sounds really funny because of course they're not moving virtually, they're also  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:11):**  moving in real life.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:12):**  But yeah, I get your point.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:13):**  Yeah, they're moving in real life.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:14):**  It's not Farmville.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:15):**  We're not playing some kind of farm simulator.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:18):**  Exactly.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:19):**  But the fencing is being moved and maybe there's less stress through animal anticipation and  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:27):**  the movement and handling of livestock.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:29):**  Well, I guess there could be welfare benefits there and performance benefits as well.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:34):**  So still early days in terms of the amount of virtual fencing that's out there in terms  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:40):**  of the hardware on livestock, still plenty of trials happening.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:44):**  But I think the potential gains are so high that it's definitely worth pursuing further.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:51):**  And there is, I think I know of about three startups that are really driving hard in the  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:57):**  space.  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:58):**  So watch this space in that regard.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:22:59):**  Yeah, it's very exciting.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:01):**  I think it's one of those examples where you can see AgTech really being a game changer  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:06):**  for building soils.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:07):**  We see a lot of AgTech, I mean, the news is constantly out there, how much money is being  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:11):**  raised for AgTech, how much money goes into vertical farming, how much money goes into  
**[0:23:15-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:15):**  conventional chemical input precision software for something, but not too much or not enough.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:23):**  I think we both agree on that is going into AgTech actually to help farmers and landowners  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:28):**  and land managers build soil faster.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:30):**  But I think that space is going to explode just as much as virtual fencing, because there's  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:36):**  so much we cannot even grasp that we can actually do with technology, like, of course, digitalising  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:42):**  something like you did, but then actually taking it five steps further, and maybe in  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:45):**  the future, even 10 is, I think, very exciting.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:49):**  If you're in the tech space, and you're interested in Ag, really focus on that piece on how do  
**[0:23:54-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:54):**  you help people build soil faster?  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:56):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:23:57):**  And there's new things coming out all the time and new initiatives.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:01):**  I mean, I've just seen one this week whereby these new soil probes that not only measure  
**[0:24:08-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:08):**  moisture, the probes go down one metre, and they measure carbon at different levels within  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:16):**  the soil, they measure nitrogen, phosphorus, they're connected by a hub.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:22):**  And that could be amazing technology when it comes to unlocking the opportunities around  
**[0:24:30-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:30):**  soil carbon markets and the access for farmers to participate in the carbon market without  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:38):**  having to do regular testing just by having probes in the ground that are delivering information,  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:44):**  and also helping with day to day management around moisture in the profile, nutrient in  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:49):**  the profile.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:51):**  It's really exciting.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:52):**  And hopefully, you know, we can see some of these bear fruit and come to light.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:24:57):**  Yeah, because I think it's, I mean, for a farmer or farm manager, you can observe a  
**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:02):**  lot and obviously you should.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:04):**  But especially if you're running bigger farms, let's say larger than a few hectares, it becomes  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:09):**  very difficult to be to have your ears and eyes on the ground, or everywhere all the  
**[0:25:14-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:14):**  time.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:15):**  And then you move to a country like Australia, where farms are gigantic, you need to take  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:18):**  a small plane to fly from one end to the other.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:21):**  It becomes completely impossible to make decisions if you don't have those inputs.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:26):**  And if you don't somewhere store it, because like our mind is just not big enough to, to  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:31):**  see it and also to connect the dots in that.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:34):**  So it's such a crucial, crucial piece.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:36):**  What do you see?  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:37):**  I mean, you've done, you're still building, but like the prediction software, the grass  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:42):**  fat management piece, what is another piece you're very excited about or something like  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:47):**  a big question you have, just like you had when you saw that amazing piece of meat and  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:52):**  you said, how do we get there consistently?  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:54):**  Is there another big thing that you see missing?  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:57):**  Is that the soil carbon piece?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:25:58):**  Or is that something else?  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:00):**  I mean, the soil carbon piece, that is, that is something we're really interested in.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:05):**  And, and really looking closely globally at the leaders in some of the new technologies  
**[0:26:11-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:11):**  in that space.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:13):**  But I guess in terms of Maya, one of the things that we're interested in at the moment is  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:18):**  the behavioral science of animals and we're looking at ear tags in livestock that can  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:25):**  again through GPS give us some insights into the behavior of animals.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:31):**  So it can help us understand things like if their heart rate changes, if their, you know,  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:39):**  their adrenaline levels rise, if they're distressed, we can track them.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:44):**  So things like we can tell if an animal is starting to show signs of distress and by  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:52):**  looking at its behavior, we can see its movement and watch it, well, you know, on our computer  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:26:58):**  screen, we can see where it's moving.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:01):**  Is it, does it look like it's restless?  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:05):**  Is it not comfortable in its environment?  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:08):**  Therefore are we meeting all of its needs in terms of environment and nutrition and  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:11):**  water?  
**[0:27:12-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:12):**  So we can start to use that information again to track livestock behavior in terms of grazing  
**[0:27:19-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:19):**  pattern and start to overlay maps in terms of grazing yield and where all of the pasture  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:26):**  is being harvested.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:27):**  And then we can get some understanding in terms of where the nutrient drawdown is within  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:33):**  a pasture or a field.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:34):**  So some of the behavioral science stuff we find interesting.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:39):**  And if you go a step further, if you can see where your livestock are as individuals and  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:45):**  let's say every 15 minutes or 10 minutes, you know, the satellite is beaming us information  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:52):**  in terms of the location of each animal, you can start thinking about, well, this becomes  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:57):**  a security tool.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:27:58):**  So if someone tries to steal my animals or one of my animals just gets out through a  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:03):**  fence and is, you know, over on a neighbor's, you can start using these things for, for  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:09):**  security and theft.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:10):**  And also things like an animal hasn't moved for a day.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:15):**  Does that mean, and is that animal a high value animal?  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:19):**  Is that a bull or a ram?  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:22):**  And is that, you know, that might be a $20,000 animal and has it injured itself or is it,  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:26):**  you know, why is it not active?  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:28):**  So behavioral science is something that's quite interesting and for us, we're exploring  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:34):**  this further.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:35):**  So yeah, watch this space.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:38):**  That's extremely, extremely exciting.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:40):**  I think we can just like when you, you stand in a landscape, you can barely imagine what  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:45):**  is possible or what used to be.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:47):**  We always look at maybe records of 20 years or 50 years or, or, but as we see now, some  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:52):**  experiments coming up, like we don't know what a healthy pasture, maybe we don't know  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:28:57):**  the mix of trees, we don't know how it used to be with large groups of animals.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:01):**  We cannot even imagine that, but we can also not imagine what technology can do for us  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:05):**  or with us in terms of management and what kind of data, like a simple between record  
**[0:29:11-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:11):**  air tech can, can get you.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:12):**  And maybe we found out that in the middle of the night, always at three, all the cows  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:17):**  gather for something or, or they all go around a certain tree or they self medicate around  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:22):**  something.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:23):**  There's, there's so much to discover there.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:25):**  I think we're going to be very surprised.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:27):**  Yeah, I agree.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:28):**  And I mean, smart tags play a key role in, in understanding that.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:32):**  And I think from a landscape point of view and a soil point of view, you know, understanding  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:39):**  at the farm level, you know, production yields within a landscape.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:42):**  So what areas are performing superior to others and is that got to do with the soil type?  
**[0:29:49-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:49):**  Is it, and what does that say about cation exchange and water holding capacity?  
**[0:29:55-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:55):**  And what's limiting in our soils or what's not limiting?  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:29:58):**  Where would we, how would we either fix a problem or enhance a good attribute?  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:04):**  Where might we deploy capital and invest in our farm based on where our livestock are  
**[0:30:10-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:10):**  harvesting?  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:11):**  And one of the other observations is it got to do with pasture composition or all the  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:16):**  things around diversity and ground cover.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:19):**  So it can play a landscape role as well to help us understand watersheds and ecosystems  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:26):**  by animal behavior and you know, they're animals as we know, they're intuitive and they've  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:32):**  grown in, in nature.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:34):**  So they can tell us so much.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:36):**  So maybe with some of this data and analytics, we can start to learn so much more about our  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:41):**  soil and plants and environments that, that we're trying to work with in farming systems.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:47):**  Yeah, they can be great and not too silent, but it can be great sensors, obviously, if  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:52):**  they don't like to be somewhere, they, and we don't force them, they won't go.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:30:57):**  And there's, especially as we're getting region act two scale where, like you said, we're  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:01):**  going to look at watershed levels, we're looking at landscape levels, we're looking at millions  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:06):**  of acres or millions of hectares even.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:08):**  We have to figure out a lot more about the landscape than we know now.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:12):**  And we can do a lot through satellite, we can do lots of sensors, but we can probably  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:16):**  do a lot through observing ourselves and a lot of indigenous knowledge, but also observing  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:21):**  animals and observing how they behave in a landscape and how we can actually regenerate  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:26):**  a full landscape instead of just, again, within brackets, just a farm, which might be enormous,  
**[0:31:31-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:31):**  but it could also be very small.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:32):**  And at the end of the day, we need many more million hectares under region management and  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:38):**  under the best region management to store as much carbon water and produce the food.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:43):**  Yeah, exactly, and I think, you know, one of the things we were conscious of in building  
**[0:31:47-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:47):**  this product, my grazing was what is all of the things that this data is telling us and  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:55):**  how can we utilise it?  
**[0:31:56-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:31:56):**  And one of the things we were conscious of is building into our product the capability  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:03):**  whereby the product could be used for carbon accounting in the future.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:09):**  So understanding things like where livestock have been throughout their life and where  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:16):**  they've harvested grass and inputs and outputs and all the things required to meet regulator  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:22):**  requirements, we built that in early.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:27):**  And all these things are contributing to building natural capital.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:32):**  So for us, it ticks so many boxes in terms of managing our landscapes better, building  
**[0:32:38-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:38):**  natural capital, creating more profitable businesses, ensuring livestock have strong  
**[0:32:46-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:46):**  and positive outcomes, enabling our people to save time and energy, but be proactive  
**[0:32:54-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:54):**  and be able to make decisions with confidence.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:32:57):**  So it ticks so many boxes for us using technology like this.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:03):**  And I kind of feel like if the regenerative movement is going to advance further, we need  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:10):**  to unpack and explore other opportunities for technology because I think that's going  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:16):**  to facilitate and support, you know, capital flows into the sector.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:21):**  We need to be demonstrating.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:23):**  We've got the tools to perform regenerative ag and again, you know, we need the markets,  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:30):**  we need the people and we need the capital, but if we've got the tools and the tools are  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:36):**  software products along with other tools, I think, you know, we're going to be in a  
**[0:33:41-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:41):**  long way of improving our soils and our ecosystems as we work together with farming businesses.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:50):**  And I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:51):**  So a final question, which I borrowed from John Kemp and I adjusted a bit to this podcast.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:33:57):**  What do you believe is true about RegenAg that others don't believe to be true?  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:02):**  I don't know what others don't believe to be true, but there's a couple of things I  
**[0:34:07-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:07):**  know and I'm passionate about.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:09):**  And one is that since we've been utilizing regenerative agriculture, we're very confident  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:17):**  it works.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:18):**  Point number one.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:19):**  Point number two, it's definitely the future.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:22):**  And we need to ensure that we adopt these practices more broadly and help some of our  
**[0:34:33-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:33):**  colleagues and friends and other farmers make the change and ensure them that yes, change  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:43):**  is difficult and change sometimes is scary, but it can be very rewarding.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:48):**  And I think our climate and our nature is telling us that things have got to change.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:34:54):**  And you know, regenerative agriculture is definitely something that we need to try and  
**[0:35:01-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:01):**  enhance into the future.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:03):**  I want to thank you so much, Bert.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:05):**  We talked a lot about cows and technology in this podcast, but in the future, and as  
**[0:35:09-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:09):**  a teaser, we're going to do more on row cropping.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:12):**  And I think there's a huge role for technology there as well.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:15):**  And actually the interaction between row cropping and livestock, I mean, there's so much more  
**[0:35:19-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:19):**  to uncover.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:20):**  It's always a pleasure to talk to you.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:22):**  Was a great interview we did in April, and I'm very happy to do another one now today.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:28):**  So I'll be checking in with you and thank you so much for sharing your technology journey  
**[0:35:31-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:31):**  this time.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:32):**  Thanks, Cohen.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:33):**  And I'd just like to say that we really appreciate the work that you put into this and your initiative  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:40):**  and banding together like minded people.

**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:53):**  ag tech in building soils.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:54):**  I hope you learned something about the role of technologies can play in the region ag  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:35:58):**  and food space.

**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:36:48):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:36:53):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:36:57):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:01):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:37:03-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:03):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:06):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:11):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:16):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:37:19-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:19):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:22):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:24):**  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:37:27):**  What questions should you ask?

**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:11):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:13):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:19):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:23):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:38:28-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:28):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:31):**  Thank you.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/#t=0:38:32):**  So what is this course?

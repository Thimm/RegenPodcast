**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  Why are we not paying farmers for quality?  A long overdue interview with Dan Gittrich on their work of measuring nutrients and the  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:20):**  connection to quality and taste.  Plus his vision of a food and agriculture system in 2030 and why if we focus more on  setting up structures and systems to pay farmers for quality, carbon, biodiversity and water  will take care of itself.  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:00:41):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:02):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  our work.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:19):**  And so many of you have joined as a member.  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:38):**  Thank you.  Welcome to a new interview with Dan Kittrich.  Our last interview was in May 2019.  And I will definitely link that interview below.  But I'm so happy to have Dan back on the show because so much has happened and it's really,  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:51):**  really time to check in.  So welcome back, Dan.  Thanks for having me, Kun.  Glad to be back.  And you're walking outside.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:01:58):**  If there's some bit of background noise, you're in your hoop house.  So you're definitely on the land.  I'm in my hoop house, actually, if I may.  Yes.  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:06):**  Please.  I mean, describe it at some point if you need to, to make some of the concepts more visual,  because obviously we're in Audioland.  But let's all imagine a very lively green or very lively hoop house.  What should we imagine where you are?  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:18):**  It just snowed last night.  And so the snow hasn't come off the top yet.  There's spinach and greens in the beds underneath layers of remay.  Nice mulched pathways.  It's quiet, calm.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:30):**  It's a beautiful, beautiful place.  Very nice place to start a podcast.  I shouldn't ask more often where people are.  Mostly they are at a desk or something.  So that's not so interesting.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:39):**  So let's say, I mean, last time we did a deep dive, obviously your work at that moment,  which is almost two years ago, I mean, time flies.  Let's start with actually a short intro for anybody that has no clue what we're talking  about at the moment.  We'll listen to the other interview, but in a few minutes, what are you working on?  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:02:55):**  You are an organic farmer for many, many years, but what is, let's say, what have you spent  the last decade on or the last five years on mostly?  What is this bio nutrient stuff that we hear so much about?  I've been an organic farmer for 30 plus years, grew up on an organic farm, so it wasn't too  hard or didn't have much choice, let's say, but haven't left it.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:13):**  For the last 10 years, I've been running an organization called the Bionutrient Food Association.  And our mission is to increase quality in the food supply.  I would say we've been leading the conversation around nutrient density, at least among the  leaders in that conversation for quite some time now.  And in the past four years, we've started a collaborative venture called the Real Food  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:34):**  Campaign, which is a partnership of a bunch of different other nonprofits, farmers, general  consumers, companies, researchers, foundations, just a broad swath of allies who are interested  in this question of nutrient density.  And so we've got three things we're trying to accomplish.  One is to build a handheld meter that can be used at point of purchase or anywhere,  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:03:59):**  flash a light and get a reading on the actual nutrient levels of food.  That's the one objective.  The second is to figure out what nutrient density is.  So people throw the word around, this is nutrient dense, but we don't actually have a definition.  So in my mind, it's not about like organic or not organic.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:16):**  It's about a continuum.  So are you at the 80th percentile of what a carrot could be or the 20th percentile?  Until we have a definition of that variation, we can't calibrate the meter to give you a  reading that means anything.  So step one, build a meter.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:29):**  Step two, figure out what quality is.  And step three, figure out what causes it.  So document all the environmental conditions, management practices, soil type, seed, microbiome.  What are the dynamics that correlate with higher nutrient levels or lower nutrient levels  in crops, which we think correlate with flavor, aroma, health giving attribute, soil health,  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:04:48):**  carbon sequestration, ecosystem services.  We think our hypothesis is that food quality can be a proxy for all these things and can  be an economic lever.  So we've moved along quite nicely.  We started in 2017 with our first generation meter.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:04):**  We built our first lab in 2018 and tested a couple of different crops, carrots and spinach,  found massive variations.  2019 went to six crops and we got the first basic calibrations for our meter.  2020 we did 20 crops.  We've got now three labs, our main one in Michigan, one in France and one in California.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:22):**  And it's building and spreading.  We're sort of deepening the process of understanding and starting to be recognized and engaged  by people that you otherwise think would have credibility.  Which is a good thing.  Yeah.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:35):**  So in 2019 you looked at six different crops.  You said what was the most shocking results?  Was it shocking data you've seen in among the six crops or under 20 you've seen in 2020?  But I think that some of the data still has to come out.  So let's look at 2019 if that's easier.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:05:51):**  So what was the most shocking thing you've seen there?  I'm pretty sure it was antioxidants and spinach.  And I think it was 364.5 to one was the variation.  And what does it mean?  Like in layman's terms?  
**[0:06:04-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:04):**  That means that this one leaf of spinach had as many antioxidants in it as that leaf of  spinach if you ate one of it every day for the year.  So you eat this spinach, like whatever you get in the box in the store, you eat one leaf  of that spinach every day for a year and you get the same level of antioxidants as from  this one leaf grown differently.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:28):**  That's the biggest variation we found so far is literally 365X.  And grown differently in this case.  Did you see that connection?  We don't know all the details.  You don't know it yet.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:37):**  We don't.  I mean, yeah, it was something is different there.  Definitely a different source.  So it was obviously grown differently.  What were the exact things?  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:06:44):**  I don't have that in my head.  But we've been saying it's five to 10X at least on is the is the like the high to low  on minerals, copper, zinc, phosphorus, potassium in crops, this carrot to that carrot.  It's not 5% or 10%.  It's 5X or 10X.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:04):**  Huge differences.  It's the mineral levels.  And then when you get to these other compounds, the flavor compounds, the health giving compounds,  it's I think it's 25 to 360X.  That's the range we're seeing.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:17):**  So nutrient variation is massive.  And what does it mean?  Do we know what that means health wise for us eating it, observing it or not observing  it?  Is there anything known or is that let's say step four after your three steps?  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:30):**  Well, there's all kind of work with nutrition on omega threes and omega sixes and, you know,  antioxidants and vitamin C. And yeah, so we do know that these nutrients are critical  for health and, you know, the compounds as well as the elements.  So I'm not sure what it is, what percentage of the world's population is zinc deficient.  It's massive.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:07:53):**  Yeah, maybe a third of the world's population is zinc deficient.  So if you can get grow this crop differently and you get 6X on the zinc, that's meaningful.  That's massive.  And did that bend looking back at that spinach, is that then the same type of spinach, the  same type of seed?  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:09):**  No, it's different, different soil, different seed, different management.  So what we're doing is identifying the variation and trying to tease out the correlations.  So if we can say which of our many thousands of samples of crops showed up most nutrient  dense with the highest levels of nutrition in them, and then we can go back and say,  now what were the environmental conditions that were causal?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:31):**  Was it a fertility program?  Was it management practices?  Was it the cultivar?  Was it the epigenetics?  Was it the climate dynamics?  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:08:37):**  What is epigenetics?  Epigenetics is how the health of the mother plants affects the baby plants.  So if you have three generations of ancestors that were in the presence of toxins and died  from cancer young, then your vitality is probably going to be low.  And so that applies just as well for spinach seed as it does for humans.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:02):**  So it seems like you're in the middle.  I mean, it's definitely a lot further along than 2019.  The meter that we talked about last time as well, I ordered the first 3D printed version.  And we're now at the end of January 2021.  Where do you stand at the moment?  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:17):**  What is going to happen this year?  I think you're going to make some huge steps.  It's not a linear growth anymore.  But what's going to happen over the next months, over the next year with all this work around  the Bionutrient Meter and the labs, and obviously also the data sets behind it?  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:32):**  Well, I think the first generation Bionutrient Meter available for sale, I think it was the  end of 2018 and started shipping them in 2019.  We only had a few hundred that we made and we pretty rapidly sold out.  So now we're in our second generation and we've updated it and we've built the calibration  standard onto it and a few other things.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:09:51):**  So now we have, and we have not just the instrument, but we have some data to calibrate it to.  Meaning that we can order at like version two now or not yet?  Yeah.  It's like it's version 1.1 or 1.2 or something.  It's still an Apple 2.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:09):**  It's not an iPhone yet.  But it's now it actually, you don't have to write the code.  Now it comes with some code, right?  Basically we're going to be shipping the next batch out in June of 2021 and it should have  calibrations for at least six crops.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:24):**  Which one?  Like a red, yellow, green, carrots, spinach, lettuce, cherry tomatoes, grapes and kale,  potentially a number more.  So meaning like I'm scanning it and it gives me a green, yellow or red, meaning I'm in  the highest percentile, the middle or the lowest.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:39):**  Yeah.  The red is the bottom quartile.  The yellow is the middle 50% and then the green is the top quartile.  That's roughly how we're presuming.  That's what our statistics are giving us the numbers for.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:50):**  It's like we can reasonably well predict that.  It's not a hundred percent.  No, of course.  We're not actually measuring the nutrients.  We're predicting based on the metadata.  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:10:58):**  That makes sense to people.  No, we should explain that.  What does it mean?  You're measuring it, but you're basically basing it on a metadata.  What does it mean when I scan, I ordered in June and I scan my cherry tomato in July and  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:10):**  it gives green.  How does it get to green?  So the first question is what is the meter and how does it work?  So there's this term spectroscopy, which is a sort of form of assessing things.  I like to use the example of astronomers and they speak with great confidence about this  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:27):**  star has this percent hydrogen and this percent helium, this percent other elements at these  levels and ratios.  And it's not because we've ever been to a star and sampled it.  It's because every element in chemistry, hydrogen or helium vibrates at a certain frequency.  And so literally the light, that vibration of that star has encoded within it like the  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:11:50):**  chemical makeup of the star.  And so if we can take a picture of light from light years away and see what something's  made up of, then we can take a picture of light from something a millimeter away and  see what something's made up of.  And so basically our spectrometer, it flashes a light at the carrot or at the lettuce and  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:09):**  it takes a picture of the light that bounces back.  And based on a bunch of lab work that we've done where we did this with thousands of crops,  we've brought them into the lab, we've flashed the light at them, took a picture of the light  that bounced back and then ran those crops through a sampling process where we tested  the copper and the zinc and the antioxidants and the polyphenols and things like that.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:28):**  We now have enough data where we can say this structure of light or this picture of light  means high levels of antioxidants.  This one means low levels.  So it's not perfect by any means, but it's...  But you read the light and know because of the lab work.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:45):**  Yes, exactly.  So that's where we're at right now is we have taken a basic instrument, built enough metadata  to calibrate it.  Which wasn't the case before.  No, no.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:12:54):**  The one in 19, I remember scanning an apple and getting some data out of it and or an  apple, a slice of apple.  And then the question is, okay, what's next?  You get a graph.  Yeah.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:04):**  What does this graph say?  Until we can understand what it means, we don't know what it means.  I knew that when I ordered it that that was going to be the results.  Not that I was expecting, but I wanted to be part of that first iPhone movement as well  or the Apple one.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:18):**  We hope we were honest about where we're at and we have into the whole time.  Yeah.  So now we're at a point where that graph gets converted to a reading.  So that's in and of itself quite significant.  And I feel very proud about that.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:30):**  But I think what you were asking about in your question is the next generation.  So as I said before, this is an Apple two, it's not an iPhone, but we have just recently  gotten some significant donations to start the process of that next generation.  And I would say we're going to go from a 1.1 to a 4.1.  I think we're going to skip the second and third generational cycles.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:13:53):**  Wow.  So how would that look like?  What should we imagine that's basically going to the Apple watch immediately or to the iPhone  12?  What's the version?  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:02):**  Even an iPhone one, it would be a significant accomplishment.  What does this thing do?  Fly as well?  It grows food?  Yeah.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:12):**  It looks like we'll be able to actually get specific numbers on things.  We won't just be building the calibration.  It'll actually be a scientific instrument so we can actually test the number of the  polyphenols parts per million or copper parts per million.  Potentially it'll be able to even go down below that into parts per billion.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:31):**  That's what we're doing this year.  Which is something that now only is possible in the lab or not possible at all?  This is very much possible in the lab.  You can go to parts per trillion in the lab if you've got the fancy equipment, but not  in the field or in the shop.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:14:42):**  It depends on how many dollars you have to spend and how heavy it is.  Normal people or normal farmers can't.  You can buy a $50,000, 10-pound handheld thing that will give you parts per million right  now.  There's stuff out there, but to really get it down to not much bigger than a smartphone  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:00):**  and at least below a couple grand, if not below $500, it'll take a couple generations.  It feels like we actually are on the development path to accomplish that now.  Timing?  You mentioned significant donations, meaning you can speed up this process significantly.  What did you, I wouldn't say promise the donations, but what's your timing, your hope, your timing  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:22):**  for this version for?  Yeah.  Well, I think based on the potentials we've got, it won't just be one.  There probably will be a different version for the agronomist and farmer than there would  be for the consumer or perhaps other people in the supply chain.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:40):**  That's what we're going to do over the next year and see.  I would expect we're going to have prototypes of some sort by the end of this year, 2021,  and I would hope that we have something marketable in 2022.  I don't think that's unreasonable, but it certainly is ambitious.  But yeah, for the time being, we've got our Binding Ship Meter version one that actually  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:15:57):**  is now functional.  But yeah, what is exciting is that we've always known that the version we've got right now  is never going to be the mass-produced slick consumer, easy functioning thing.  It was really about like, is it possible to do this?  And I think we've pretty clearly shown it is possible.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:15):**  And now we're in a place to really do what we think needs to be done.  So I feel very excited about that.  I feel honored and blessed.  And I think, you know, it could be significant.  It could be very, very significant.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:27):**  So the field in general, looking at when we talk almost two years ago, I mean, at least  in my bubble, it seems to have exploded the attention for soil regeneration, regenerative  agriculture approaches, practices.  We see it everywhere from Walmart to Cargill to obviously the organic or the soil building  farmer at the corner.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:16:47):**  What have you seen in your niche of or your part of the nutrient discussion?  Has that changed a lot over the last years or hasn't it?  Yeah, well, I think it's gone from a concept that people didn't agree was true, that there  was meaningful nutrient variation in food.  I think that people said every carrot is more or less the same.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:09):**  Yeah.  And when we started 10 years ago, that was kind of what the assumption was.  Like it wasn't even discussed really in my circles.  And I was traveling in the organic circle for 20 years.  Why do you think is that?  
**[0:17:20-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:20):**  Or was that?  Well, I mean, it just sort of when the organic started, they wanted to be able to test to  see if it was better, but they didn't have the ability to.  And so it went to a sort of a practice based standard.  Like don't do this, follow these practices, and then you get to be certified.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:37):**  You're saying if the meter was out there and the software, et cetera, at that point, organic  might have taken a different street.  I know it would have.  Absolutely.  I mean, my parents helped write some of the first standards in the eighties.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:17:47):**  Yeah, that was exactly the struggle they were having was.  The tech wasn't there basically.  We should be doing this because it's better, not just because it's less bad, but we don't  have any way of testing better.  So we're just going to make sure you don't do bad.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:00):**  Maybe a bit of a simplification, but I think it's effectively it.  No, but it makes a lot of sense.  And now it's different because this stuff is coming and coming up.  Well, and now I think, well, what's exciting is that we have this confluence of events  where, you know, especially with the climate conversation pushing it along.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:17):**  I mean, even five years ago, the climate piece wasn't so big.  Nobody was talking about soil carbon five years ago.  No, it really was a very small cadre of people who understood that possibility.  I mean, some people have been talking about it forever, but as far as the broader conversation  that hadn't gotten there.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:31):**  And so we'll say that the regenerative, the term, the movement, quote unquote, has brought  the climate consciousness energy into what was already a very well established alternative,  sustainable, organic, permaculture, biodynamic, agroecology world.  It's brought that wisdom was already there and well established.  And now we've got the companies and the angst and the climate concerns and the people trying  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:18:56):**  to make money on carbon and everything else.  So when you put those two things together, the most powerful economic lever in my mind  is the nutrient density of the food.  And so that's what's exciting to me right now over the past even just a few months,  but definitely over the past couple of years is that a lot of the people that I consider  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:14):**  to be, you know, I think a lot of people would say are leading lights, thoughtful people,  respected voices are coming to the conclusion that nutrient density sure looks like it's  got a lot of potential to be the economic driver that facilitates these objectives,  meaning it's not enough or maybe not even crucial to be paying for carbon storage in  the soil as long as we're not paying for quality.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:37):**  Because if we do that and we can measure quality and we know what nutrient density is, I mean,  there are a lot of ifs there.  By definition or because of these practices, you will be storing carbon and restoring biodiversity  and water storage and all of those.  But it's focused on quality first.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:19:52):**  You will be doing all those things also.  But the incentive for you as a farmer, I mean, it's an economics thing.  You will make more money because your plants are healthier than you will from the carbon.  It's a nice extra, obviously, but it's not the driver.  Well, the carbon is great and ecosystem service markets are great.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:09):**  And I'm not saying people shouldn't get paid for it.  But the more we get down to the rabbit hole of people have to look at carbon and labile  carbon and stable carbon and at, you know, 10 centimeters and at 30 centimeters, we  understand what a complicated problem it is to try to monetize it.  It's going to require any number of really whatever.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:27):**  I mean, that's the whole conversation.  And I don't want to say people shouldn't follow it.  I think it's great that that's the entranceway to a deeper conversation.  That's a nice way of putting it.  And then I mean, it's such a fundamental shift to look at quality instead of quantity.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:40):**  And obviously, we still have to look at quantity because we need to produce.  But the quality discussion is every time I talk to somebody about it, it's such a quality  and taste and the nutrients in food, etc.  It's such a completely new field that people enter basically like, oh, that's actually  possible.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:20:56):**  And of course, because you know, when people know that taste is different, but the connection  to health and the connection to nutrients is often not not made.  It's assumed it's kind of one of those things that when you say it to people are like, obviously,  that's the case, or I would be very, very surprised if it's not the case.  But the fact is, we have no thoughtful systemic data to confirm or deny it.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:17):**  And so because we don't have the data, we can't say anything that we can just say it  tastes wow, it is tastes amazing of this tomato I buy at the farmers market, etc.  But we never dared to make the food as medicine claim after which sort of logically follows.  It's there's any amount of data which would suggest that's the case, but it hasn't been  categorically put together.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:21:36):**  And that's what we're trying to accomplish.  Our thought is if we can use science to verify these things, which we are fairly certain  are the case, then we can use economics to incentivize them and facilitate that rapid  global transformation to a more balanced climate and culture.  So what you're saying the biggest lever or the fastest potential point to kickstart or  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:00):**  accelerate this transition to more regenerative approaches, more regenerative farms and farmers,  more soil being regenerated is the focus of quality and paying our farmers that are doing  the right things or part of the right things or most of the right things to more because  they grow quality and move up the rest in that process.  I think it's going to end up being easier to focus on quality than to focus on carbon  
**[0:22:22-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:22):**  and it's going to be more economically advantageous.  Let's talk a bit about a conference that's coming up.  Actually, it's not a conference.  Let's talk about the 10th annual Soil and Nutrition Conference.  You used to do I mean, nine times, obviously, otherwise, it's not the 10th, a big conference  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:36):**  focusing on all of these topics and really pushing the agenda here.  Obviously, in COVID times, a big conference isn't happening.  You've chosen a different route.  Can you elaborate a bit on that?  Yeah, well, I think we've, you know, looked at the ecosystem and said, there's a whole  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:22:51):**  bunch of people doing two day intensives in December, January, February and March, at  least in the northern hemisphere.  So let's not try to compete in that space.  You know, what's not being done.  And so I think it's the like the podcast style is something that comes out every week.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:09):**  What we're planning on doing is we had a bunch of speakers lined up amazing speakers.  Yeah, well, we try to usually get speakers.  I was very impressed.  I was bummed that I could travel and go.  Yeah, instead of having them be across from each other.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:23):**  So four things at a time, or five things at a time, all over two days, we said, let's  give each person enough space to get so they get an hour and a half instead of an hour.  And they get everybody at the whole conference can listen to them and pose questions to them.  And we'll spread it out over the year.  So basically, what we have is over the next eight months, starting beginning of February,  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:45):**  a webinar series, which we're calling the 10th annual soil nutrition conference, which  is, you know, got four sort of tracks.  One is the real food campaign.  So everything we're doing with the testing and the meter and the science and the farm  partners and how you can engage and collaborate.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:23:59):**  And a second one is the agronomy track.  So principles of best management practice, one is the nutrition track.  So what we understand about how we can correlate this to our health, etc, etc.  And then the final one is what we're calling mycelial culture.  So thinking about decolonizing our minds, our culture, the wisdom about the indigenous  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:20):**  perspective, and what is that?  And how can those of us who were not brought up in it, you know, step back and tune into  what I think is intuitive for all of us.  It's just a question of whether we had the nurture in our childhood of that.  I think we've got this is part of what is exciting about the regenerative community  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:36):**  is very much aligned with these deeper symbiotic principles.  And so that's our fourth track.  And so we basically have these different speakers from different tracks that are going to be  alternating from February to September.  And we've gotten amazing registrations from people all over the planet.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:24:53):**  That's going to be quite an exciting.  Where can people find out more?  Soilandnutrition.org.  I will definitely put it in the shownet.  Scholarships are available.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:04):**  And we have got a global community price of $21 for anybody who's not in Europe, North  America or Australia, New Zealand.  So if you're from South America, Africa, Asia, then it's $21.  And if that's too much for you, we've got scholarships for you also.  So yeah, I'm not sure if the Oxford Real Farming Conference did a really wonderful job, I think.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:25):**  Spread it out over a week, basically.  But they got 5000 people and they had a global price.  And they really had speakers from 500 presenters.  Yeah, it was massive.  5000 attendees.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:36):**  A really, really wonderful model for I think a lot of the other organizations about how  to broaden the base.  Let's take the privilege we've had of going to these conferences that cost hundreds of  thousands of dollars to go to at the end of it and make that community knowledge share  process available to everyone on the planet.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:25:53):**  That feels like a really wonderful opportunity.  I think they did an amazing job.  I'm sure you're doing as well to really rethink what that conference meant and bring it completely  online, obviously, but then make it incredibly accessible and completely shifting also what  presenters meant there.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:10):**  Because before, obviously, it was only the people that could travel to Oxford or to the  UK or in this case to you as well that could present and most of the people can't.  And so they did an incredible job of completely switching it from UK focus, mostly UK focus  to global and an incredible array of presenters and audience that responded and joined.  So yeah, that's what we're up to is we're spreading it out.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:33):**  Which is great.  I mean, you can bite size pieces is probably better than a full two day deep dive and the  community piece.  I'm sure that will come back like the privilege of spending time together quality time offline  will be hopefully something we cherish much more, but will happen in smaller groups in  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:26:49):**  hopefully on nice locations on nice farms, etc. to do that, but the online piece just  makes it much more accessible for all.  Well, that's one other exciting piece of news we have at the BFA is that we're about to  get our hands on a 360 acre farm here in Massachusetts as a to have as a education demonstration  research hub, which is, you know, in my mind, going to be, you know, in large part, helping  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:14):**  to provide farmer training and farm tenure, land access, land tenure to people who want  to be part of that transition.  So in my mind, at this point, it's not that we haven't figured a lot of things out.  It's that we don't have the structure of local dissemination on the ground.  I think it's one thing to learn things and in podcasts and recordings, and that's really  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:37):**  wonderful.  And so it's a great support to people that are kind of out in the wilderness, but it's  only scratches the surface.  Yeah.  We need a hub, every county in every country on the planet.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:27:47):**  We need a demonstration site in a 10 or 20 mile radius or ish globally where we're actually  implementing and training and grounding.  As far as I'm concerned, it's not the first time it comes up.  It comes up actually on the podcast, which is very interesting.  So we're going to have one and we're going to do what we can to model everything and  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:05):**  share as much as possible.  And what's the current, what are the management approaches or agriculture approaches currently  on that farm?  Like how extreme is going to be the shift?  That's my question.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:15):**  It's been hay for the last 20 years.  It was actually on the Olympic trials.  It was owned by horse people and made to look really fancy.  Prior to that, it was a dairy farm for 200 years.  That's going to be a shift.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:26):**  Yeah.  It's a beautiful canvas.  Do a lot of sampling before you change the management practices because it's going to  be a very interesting sample size.  Our intention is to really engage a thoughtful scientific process and to document any number  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:40):**  of different little experiments.  Yeah.  If we've got the lab equipment to be able to test all kinds of stuff in real time, we  can have all kinds of little experiments going on.  Wow.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:28:50):**  Yeah.  I don't know.  So that'll be fun.  A question that I, not recently, but I've been asking, I think after we recorded our  previous podcast, it's been a regular, but I haven't asked it to you yet.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:00):**  I think, and it's a bit of a mind shift there.  Imagine you wake up tomorrow morning, I mean, now you're waking up to also a massive farm  and actually you're getting some interesting donations in.  But let's say for a moment we push that aside and you are an investment manager and you  actually have a billion dollar investment fund under your management.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:17):**  You can invest that whatever shape or form, et cetera, you like.  It is meant to be an investment or investments, meaning it should come back at some point,  but the duration and the returns, et cetera, are up to you.  I'm asking these questions to people because I'm very interested in the decision making  framework.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:33):**  What do people prioritize?  What do they focus on?  I'm not so interested if you're going to invest.  Like what's the exact breakdown of what you would do, but I'm very interested, would you  prioritize if you had a large investment fund at your disposal tomorrow morning?  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:46):**  Yeah.  Well, you sent me that email with that question a couple hours ago and I certainly haven't  gotten to the point where I haven't answered that question.  I can take a couple of shots, but I haven't really meditated on it.  The first thing that comes up is usually the best.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:29:59):**  Well, the first thing that came up was that, you know, let's replicate what we're doing  here with this big piece of land.  And I think education is massively important.  You know, what I feel like we're doing is the most important thing.  So the nutrient density piece, documenting, verifying, calibrating, whatever it is, establishing  
**[0:30:19-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:19):**  some empirical framework around this deeper conversation so that any number of other businesses  can succeed by leading in this space feels like a very valuable investment.  Our struggle has been that because we're a nonprofit, we only do this off charitable  donations for the commons.  We want all that core information to be in the commons and not to be proprietary controlled.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:41):**  So that's going to be counter to the incentives of somebody looking for an ROI because we're  not offering any.  You would invest it in other hubs, basically like the one you're building now, which could  be, I mean, very interesting investment, very long term, but definitely, I mean, people  have done very interesting things in education.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:30:57):**  There's a group out here in Massachusetts and Western Mass that's, you know, been a  little bit inspired by a group in Vermont, but they're looking at the food system regionally  and saying, where are the holes?  Like the slaughterhouses, the creameries, the commercial kitchens, whatever it is, what  are the infrastructural holes in the system that are keeping the local farmer community  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:19):**  from being economically viable?  So there's a ton of relatively small investments in any regional ecosystem that could intelligently  be made that would actually probably spin off reasonable return.  But I think to do that right probably would require having a base in that community first  to be able to discern what its needs are.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:31:40):**  And I know there's various funds that are looking at this kind of a model, but I think  I would say engage in the networks that you're part of in an active way.  If you can get your hands on a big piece of land and you can begin to implement practices  and produce crops that will give you good, reasonable profits, then if it's only 2% or  5% you're looking for, you want a reasonable return, but you're creating all amount of  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:01):**  cultural value, I would say that's how you should be thinking about your returns on a  billion dollar investment.  I mean, I'm not a, I don't have much money at all, but I don't think you'd need that  much money.  And the question is when you do have that much money, how do you use it most well for  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:14):**  the greatest good, not just for the ROI in a capital standpoint?  I think it's an excellent answer.  And actually it's an interesting segue into something I wanted to ask as well is because  you mentioned briefly on the Q and A webinar we just did, your vision for agriculture.  And it's interesting because you just got your hands on a big piece of land and your  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:32):**  vision that you laid out there, but I would love to hear it here again, or a bit more  elaborated because we had a few minutes only left is actually not necessarily gigantic  farms.  What is your vision?  Let's say we're now in 2021.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:32:45):**  So in nine years, so the decade to the end of the decade, what do you see if a lot of  the things we've discussed will happen around quality, around focus, obviously on soil,  what do you see happening for the next nine years and what's your idea there?  Well, I think broadly, I mean, I've always said that this nutrient density thing and  the spectrometer is just a shiny object.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:06):**  This is a little thing to catch people's attention to bring them down a rabbit hole that will  provide all kinds of wonderful, you know, a path that's very inspiring.  So for me, the end game looks like to some degree, more of a traditional human civilization  with culture and with community and with relationship with land.  And I would say with some level of empowerment and agency as well, I think to a large degree  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:33):**  is missing in the colonized culture.  I would like to see people supported in having land tenure, in having some level of self  sufficiency.  I'm not saying that the only thing you do to make your living is grow food.  But if you can have access to land where you can provide a lot of your needs, then the  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:33:55):**  actual money you need is much less and your agency, your freedom, your safety is much  greater.  Which we all learned last year.  This has been a beautiful process in showing the profound vulnerability of the current  system, which people always knew in the back of their mind, but you know, whatever, it  
**[0:34:13-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:13):**  was fine now.  And I think we've been trained to be cogs in an industrial wheel.  We have been removed from our relationship to land, to elders, to tradition, to culture,  to a large degree.  Not everybody has to be a farmer.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:27):**  But I think if we have many, many more people on the land, in chunks of land that are smaller,  5, 10, 20 acres, it's going to be a different level of empowerment broadly.  If somebody in your family has land, it's not you, then you've got access to that.  Then there's all kinds of things that are possible.  This is one of those things you bring people out of the city and onto the land and you  
**[0:34:50-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:34:50):**  watch them and they go through all these processes of deep, profound experience, tears.  It's a really interesting process.  And I think that's where we're heading is culturally revitalization.  I think with the insights we have about how we can re-green the massive areas of the continents  that are brown, we can look at this from a global standpoint and see the opportunity  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:11):**  there to move towards much greater empowerment.  And as people feel that agency and ownership and they have the cultural strength, they  will be able to manage the land most well to re-green it, to re-engage the water cycle,  to much more actively facilitate way more carbon sequestration than it would have occurred  in a big monoculture.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:31):**  We need to deal with the environmental issues.  We need to deal with the cultural issues.  And I think that that comes foundationally with more people being in deeper relationship  with land.  So that's what we're going to try to accomplish with our piece of property is use it as a  
**[0:35:45-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:35:45):**  training education site.  We've got regional land trusts immediately adjacent and in very close proximity that have  thousands of acres here in central Massachusetts that they are trying to get people to take  99-year leases on and nobody wants it.  We could facilitate in this one town with this one land trust, 80 people each having  
**[0:36:08-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:08):**  10 acres.  That's massive in Massachusetts.  And so act locally, think globally and good living coming up to land.  There's all these people that are looking for an ultimate lifestyle and structure.  Let's facilitate that education.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:23):**  In large part, people have not been brought up in the land and their practical skill sets  are very low.  So we need to facilitate that training, including most people.  I'm born in the city center and I definitely, you're a product of the culture.  My skill set is not on the land.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:40):**  That's fascinating.  And what I especially find, I mean, many more people have said similar things.  We need more, I mean, we need more people on the land and it always stays sort of as  a wish, like the move to the land piece, et cetera, et cetera.  But what it's fascinating about your work is one of the underlying principles is it  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:36:58):**  needs to be more profitable to be a good farmer or to be a good soil farmer.  And for that, we need to focus on quality.  Like there's a very practical X step and the steps could be many, many, many, but if we  don't pay for quality, if we don't know even what quality is and we don't start paying  and finding those farmers or those collectives that are doing a great job of managing their  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:17):**  soil and thus managing their, the health coming and the taste coming off their farms, then  we can wish that everybody goes back to the land, but, or many goes back to the land,  but it sort of is impractical.  But that one lever of quality can really unlock many farm lives.  It can help leverage it.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:32):**  It's not that we don't already know how to grow plants well and you don't have to have  a label like organic or nutrient dense.  If your customers are looking for quality, they'll choose your stuff over anybody else's.  And when your plants are healthier, your cost of production is lower.  That was my experience being a much more active farmer than I am now.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:37:50):**  You know, the last couple of years that the organization has just gotten too big and so  I had to do much less farming than I was recently.  But my experience farming is that when your plants are healthy, your cost of production  is lower and you don't need to charge top dollar and your profitability is higher.  But I grew up on a farm and I've got that sort of 30 years of experience.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:08):**  So if we can use the research process to document which management practices and which environmental  conditions are most appropriate and share that openly globally, and we can have begin  to have some of these economic levers in place and we can correlate that with local demonstration  practice sites and you know, and tenure.  I think we can align a number of really powerful incentives and the cultural upheaval over  
**[0:38:32-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:32):**  the past year has been a perfect preparation for that.  It's really caused a lot of people to think deeply about where they are and what they  want to do with themselves.  And what would you say to like, what do you tell investors that are listening?  I mean, I asked this about a question last time, but I'm curious if the answer has changed  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:38:49):**  or if you have any other, like what people that are thinking deep about themselves, what  they want to do, not only with their hands in terms of land.  I think many people I know with wealth as well want to be practically involved and I  think that's amazing.  But the second part is what should they or could they be doing with their wealth?  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:05):**  Where should they be looking or not looking?  What would you tell them to, because many more people have spent the last year forcefully  thinking a lot, where would they look to start deploying to become active if you have, let's  say more than average wealth and you want to put that to work?  You know, it's not a circle I travel in.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:22):**  That's why I'm asking it.  I hear about all these things that are out there.  As far as I'm concerned, I have to go back.  So I really believe in what I'm doing.  What we're doing with this data collection openly to build structure in a sort of a precompetitive  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:38):**  space kind of manner, I think is going to leverage billions and billions of dollars  worth of profits.  So I'm trying to do all the work that I can to create a structure where all those investments,  if they're really supporting good work, will become more profitable.  So this is the time to get on the quality bandwagon.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:39:56):**  I would say take 1% of your investment money and donate it to the BFA and we'll have the  interest to you faster.  That's a good answer.  I mean, this space needs support.  And at the same time, it's going to unlock an enormous potential and it's going to show  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:09):**  a lot of things on food quality that we maybe didn't want to know.  We sort of always knew, but we don't really want to.  But it's also going to create an incredible space over the next year.  So I think it's extremely exciting.  The sooner we figure this out, the sooner we'll be able to really support the transition,  
**[0:40:26-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:26):**  not just make money.  Ideally, not just doing this to make money, doing this because we want to facilitate a  better world.  So I think having that empirical framework where we can categorically connect environmental  conditions, management practices, soil health, ecosystem function, farm viability, nutrient  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:42):**  levels, human health, the more we can tie those things together empirically in a really  confident fashion, the faster and more successful this transition will be.  I think it's a perfect place to end.  I want to thank you so much for your time again, to check in, to share where you're  at.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:40:59):**  I will definitely check the version 1.1 in June later this year.  Will it be basically like, can I use my current version?  So will it just be a software update or do I have to get a new one?  Well, we have built into it a calibration metric.  We didn't have a way to sort of bring it to zero.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:15):**  I like to use the example of the kitchen scale.  The tar button.  Yeah, the tar button.  We've got a tar button on it now.  That's exactly what we've got.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:23):**  So other than that, it's the same thing.  People who do have the previous versions, it might just be easier for you to send it  back and we will update it and send it back to you and it won't cost that much.  Okay, that's a good point.  But the version 1.1 meters, we do have only a limited number of boards.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:39):**  So they're available for sale now and I expect it will be sold out of them long before June  when we start shipping them.  Get your hands on one if you want to.  If enough people pre-order, then we may get other batch of boards from Asia.  But right now there's limited supply.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:41:53):**  Perfect.  Get your hands on some.  Not to be trying to be a marketing person.  No, no.  I mean, if it's the truth, I mean, then it's good marketing and good sales.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:42:02):**  Get your hands on one if you want to.  We're not trying to mass produce these things.  We're doing them in batches of hundreds and we don't have the consumer meter yet.  This is an iterative process, but there are only a few hundred out there in the world.  I'm very excited to have one.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:42:16):**  So that's and I'm definitely going to upgrade it.  So thank you so much then for your time.  And I wish you a great day.  And of course, we'll be checking in.  Thank you, Koen.

How to put money to work in regenerating soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while  doing it.  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:44:03):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:44:20):**  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?

We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:45:53-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:45:53):**  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  
**[0:46:09-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-kittredge-2#t=0:46:09):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.
